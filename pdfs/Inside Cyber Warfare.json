    "output": "Foreword\nDuring his campaign for reelection in 1996, the Internet-savvy President Bill Clinton\nused the slogan “Building a Bridge to the 21st Century.” It turns out that the bridge is\noperated and maintained in cyber form, and that malevolent actors can practice their\nblack arts to disrupt or destroy the bridge, its cyber traffic, and all who rely upon it.\nAnd although it is disturbingly clear that the bridge to the 21st century can be taken\nout, it is even more clear that we don’t always know by whom or why.\nJeffrey Carr’s Inside Cyber Warfare explores the factual background of why that is so,\nwho the actors are (and their motivations) and the likely future course of cyber warfare\nin all its manifestations. In part, this book’s value is the comprehensiveness of its cov-\nerage, across the spectrum of militarized or warlike computer network operations\n(CNO). New students of the field—and there are many, in academia, government, and\nprivate industry—will benefit from the clear explication of the divisions between com-\nputer network defense, computer network exploitation, and computer network attack.\nExamples abound of each, described in dispassionate, factual prose more helpful than\nthe sometimes frightening headline media coverage of isolated events.\nExperts in the field of cyber warfare and CNO will find that these pages are required\nreading, for Jeffrey Carr has applied an evidentiary analytical framework to under-\nstanding the intricacies that distinguish state and non-state actors and hackers, and the\nvarying but discoverable mosaic of political, economic, and social motivations that\nincentivize cyber warfare.\nI first became aware of Jeffrey Carr and his expertise while serving in the intelligence\ncommunity, where like others, I relied on his much-read-within-the-Beltway blog\nIntelfusion. For this book, Carr’s background is ideal: an early career at the world’s\nleading software and technology company (Microsoft), his entrepreneurial founding of\nthe highly regarded Project Grey Goose (which I have advised), and the activities of his\nGreyLogic organization. He now adds to that list the title of “authority,” with its im-\nprimatur stamped by virtue of the pages in this book.\nxi\nMilitary analysts, pundits, and warfighters alike have known for centuries the Latin\nadage attributed to “the Roman Sun Tzu,” Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus, famous\nfor his “art-of-war” classic from 390 BC, De Re Militari: “Si vis pacem, para bellum”;\nif you wish peace, prepare for war. Inside Cyber Warfare is the necessary handbook for\na new 21st century in which all who hope for the new world of cyber-powered peaceful\ninteractions must prepare for cyber war.\n—Lewis Shepherd\nChief Technology Officer and Senior Fellow,\nMicrosoft Institute for Advanced Technology in Governments\nSenior Technology Officer, Defense Intelligence Agency (2004–2007)\nxii | Foreword"

    "output": "Preface\nI was recently invited to participate in a cyber security dinner discussion by a few\nmembers of a well-known Washington D.C. think tank. The idea was that we could\nenjoy a fine wine and a delicious meal while allowing our hosts to pick our brains about\nthis “cyber warfare stuff.” It seems that the new threatscape emerging in cyberspace\nhas caught them unprepared and they were hoping we could help them grasp some of\nthe essentials in a couple of hours. By the time we had finished dinner and two bottles\nof a wonderful 2003 red, one of the Fellows in attendance was holding his head in his\nhands, and it wasn’t because of the wine.\nInternational acts of cyber conflict (commonly but inaccurately referred to as cyber\nwarfare) are intricately enmeshed with cyber crime, cyber security, cyber terrorism, and\ncyber espionage. That web of interconnections complicates finding solutions because\ngovernments have assigned different areas of responsibility to different agencies which\nhistorically do not play well with others. Then there is the matter of political will. When\nI signed the contract to write this book, President Obama had committed to make cyber\nsecurity a top priority in his administration. Seven months later, as I write this intro-\nduction, cyber security has been pushed down the priority ladder behind the economy\nand health care, and the position of cyber coordinator, who originally was going to\nreport directly to the President, must now answer to multiple bosses with their own\nagendas. A lot of highly qualified candidates have simply walked away from a position\nthat has become a shadow of its former self. Consequently, we all find ourselves holding\nour heads in our hands more often than not.\nCyberspace as a warfighting domain is a very challenging concept. The temptation to\nclassify it as just another domain, like air, land, sea, and space, is frequently the first\nmistake that’s made by our military and political leaders and policy makers.\nI think that a more accurate analogy can be found in the realm of science fiction’s\nparallel universes–—mysterious, invisible realms existing in parallel to the physical\nworld, but able to influence it in countless ways. Although that’s more metaphor than\nreality, we need to change the habit of thinking about cyberspace as if it’s the same\nthing as “meat” space.\nxiii"

    "input": "How This Book Came to Be",
    "output": "After all, the term “cyberspace” was first coined by a science fiction writer. My own\nchildhood love affair with science fiction predated William Gibson’s 1984 novel Neu-\nromancer, going all the way back to The New Tom Swift Jr. Adventures series, which\nwas the follow-up to the original series of the early 1900s. By some quirk of fate, the\nfirst Tom Swift Jr. book was published in 1954 (the year that I was born) and ceased\npublication in 1971 (the year that I left home for college). Although the young inventor\ndidn’t have cyberspace to contend with, he did have the “Atomic Earth Blaster” and\nthe “Diving Sea Copter.” In an otherwise awful childhood, the adventures of Tom Swift\nJr. kept me feeling sane, safe, and excited about the future until I was old enough to\nleave home and embark on my own adventures.\nNow, 38 years later, I find myself investigating a realm that remains a sci-fi mystery to\nmany leaders and policy makers of my generation, while younger people who have\ngrown up with computers, virtual reality, and online interactions of all kinds are per-\nfectly comfortable with it. For this reason, I predict that the warfighting domain of\ncyberspace won’t truly find its own for another five to eight years, when military officers\nwho have grown up with a foot in both worlds rise to senior leadership roles within the\nDepartment of Defense.\nHow This Book Came to Be\nThis book exists because of an open source intelligence (OSINT) experiment that I\nlaunched on August 22, 2008, named Project Grey Goose (Figure P-1). On August 8,\n2008, while the world was tuning in to the Beijing Olympics, elements of the Russian\nFederation (RF) Armed Forces invaded the nation of Georgia in a purported self-defense\naction against Georgian aggression. What made this interesting to me was the fact that\na cyber component preceded the invasion by a few weeks, and then a second, much\nlarger wave of cyber attacks was launched against Georgian government websites\nwithin 24 hours of the invasion date. These cyber attacks gave the appearance of being\nentirely spontaneous, an act of support by Russian “hacktivists” who were not part of\nthe RF military. Other bloggers and press reports supported that view, and pointed to\nthe Estonian cyber attacks in 2007 as an example. In fact, that was not only untrue, but\nit demonstrated such shallow historical analysis of comparable events that I found\nmyself becoming more and more intrigued by the pattern that was emerging. There\nwere at least four other examples of cyber attacks timed with RF military actions dating\nback to 2002. Why wasn’t anyone exploring that, I wondered?\nI began posting what I discovered to my blog IntelFusion.net, and eventually it caught\nthe attention of a forward deployed intelligence analyst working at one of the three-\nletter agencies. By “forward deployed” I refer to those analysts who are under contract\nto private firms but working inside the agencies. In this case, his employer was Palantir\nTechnologies. “Adam” (not his real name) had been a long-time subscriber to my blog\nand was as interested in the goings-on in Georgia as I was. He offered me the free use\nof the Palantir analytic platform for my analysis.\nxiv | Preface\nFigure P-1. The official logo of Project Grey Goose\nAfter several emails and a bunch of questions on my part, along with my growing\nfrustration at the overall coverage of what was being played out in real time in the North\nCaucasus, I flashed on a solution. What would happen if I could engage some of the\nbest people inside and outside of government to work on this issue without any re-\nstrictions, department politics, or bureaucratic red tape? Provide some basic guidance,\na collaborate work space, and an analytic platform, and let experienced professionals\ndo what they do best? I loved the idea. Adam loved it. His boss loved it.\nOn August 22, 2008, I announced via my blog and Twitter an open call for volunteers\nfor an OSINT experiment that I had named Project Grey Goose. Prospective volunteers\nwere asked to show their interest by following a temporary Twitter alias that I had\ncreated just for this enrollment. Within 24 hours, I had almost 100 respondents con-\nsisting of college students, software engineers, active duty military officers, intelligence\nanalysts, members of law enforcement, hackers, and a small percentage of Internet-\ncreated personas who seemed to have been invented just to see if they could get in (they\ndidn’t). It was an astounding display of interest, and it took a week for a few colleagues\nand I to make the selections. We settled on 15 people, Palantir provided us with some\ntraining on their platform, and the project was underway. Our Phase I report was pro-\nduced about 45 days later. A follow-up report was produced in April 2009. This book\npulls from some of the data that we collected and reported on, plus it contains quite a\nbit of new data that has not been published before.\nA lot has happened between April 2009 and September 2009, when the bulk of my\nwriting for this book was done. As more and more data is moved to the Cloud and the\npopularity of social networks continues to grow, the accompanying risks of espionage\nand adversary targeting grow as well. While our increasingly connected world does\nmanage to break down barriers and increase cross border friendships and new under-\nstandings, the same geopolitical politics and national self interests that breed conflicts\nand wars remain. Conflict continues to be an extension of political will, and now\nPreface | xv"

As he was being transported to police headquarters, one of the officers\nin the car “accidentally” discharged his weapon into the head of Magomed Yevloev.\nThe U.S. Department of State called for an investigation. Vladimir Putin reportedly said\nthat there would be an investigation. To date, nothing has been done.\nIngushetia.ru (now Ingushetia.org) and the Chechen website kavkazcenter.com are\nsome of the earliest examples of politically motivated Russian cyber attacks dating as\nfar back as 2002. In other words, in addition to Russian military operations in Chech-\nnya, there were cyber attacks launched against opposition websites as well.\nThe Russia Georgia War of August 2008 is the latest example, occurring just a few\nweeks before Magomed Yevloev’s killing. If anyone would qualify as a casualty of cyber\nwarfare, it might just be this man.\nThe Complex Domain of Cyberspace\nThe focus of this book is cyber warfare, and therein lies the first complexity that must\nbe addressed. As of this writing, there is no international agreement on what constitutes\nan act of cyber war, yet according to McAfee’s 2008 Virtual Criminology Report, there\nare over 120 nations “leveraging the Internet for political, military, and economic es-\npionage activities.”\n1"

An estimated 3,000 hackers self-organized into a group called the China\nHacker Emergency Meeting Center, according to Dahong Min’s 2005 blog entry enti-\ntled “Say goodbye to Chinese hackers’ passionate era: Writing on the dissolving mo-\nment of ‘Honker Union of China.’” The hackers launched attacks against Indonesian\ngovernment websites in protest.\nAbout one year later on May 7, 1999, a NATO jet accidentally bombed the Chinese\nembassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Less than 12 hours later, the Chinese Red Hacker\nAlliance was formed and began a series of attacks against several hundred U.S. gov-\nernment websites.\nThe next event occurred in 2001 when a Chinese fighter jet collided with a U.S. military\naircraft over the South China Sea. This time over 80,000 hackers became engaged in\nlaunching a “self-defense” cyber war for what they deemed to be an act of U.S. aggres-\nsion. The New York Times referred to it as “World Wide Web War I.”\nSince then, most of the PRC’s focus has been on cyber espionage activities in accordance\nwith its military strategy to focus on mitigating the technological superiority of the U.S.\nmilitary.\nIsrael\nIn late December 2008, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead against Palestine. A cor-\nresponding cyber war quickly erupted between Israeli and Arabic hackers, which has\nbeen the norm of late when two nation states are at war.\nThe unique aspect of this case is that at least part of the cyber war was engaged in by\nstate hackers rather than the more common non-state hackers. Members of the Israeli\nDefense Forces hacked into the Hamas TV station Al-Aqsa to broadcast an animated\ncartoon showing the deaths of Hamas’ leadership with the tag line “Time is running\nout” (in Arabic).\n2 | Chapter 1: Assessing the Problem"

In other words, states gain plausible deniability.\nRussia\nThe Second Russian-Chechen War (1997–2001). During this conflict, in which the Russian mili-\ntary invaded the breakaway region of Chechnya to reinstall a Moscow-friendly regime,\nboth sides used cyberspace to engage in Information Operations to control and shape\npublic perception.\nEven after the war officially ended, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) was\nreportedly responsible for knocking out two key Chechen websites at the same time\nthat Russian Spetsnaz troops engaged Chechen terrorists who were holding Russian\ncivilians hostage in a Moscow theatre on October 26, 2002.\nThe Estonian cyber war (2007). Although there is no hard evidence linking the Russian gov-\nernment to the cyber attacks launched against Estonian government websites during\nthe week of April 27, 2007, at least one prominent Russian Nashi youth leader,\nKonstantin Goloskokov, has admitted his involvement along with some associates.\nGoloskokov turned out to be the assistant to State Duma Deputy Sergei Markov of the\npro-Kremlin Unified Russia party.\nThe activating incident was Estonia’s relocation of the statue “The Bronze Soldier of\nTallinn,” dedicated to soldiers of the former Soviet Union who had died in battle. The\nresulting massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks took down Estonian\nwebsites belonging to banks, parliament, ministries, and communication outlets.\nThe Russia-Georgia War (2008). This is the first example of a cyber-based attack that coinci-\nded directly with a land, sea, and air invasion by one state against another. Russia\ninvaded Georgia in response to Georgia’s attack against separatists in South Ossetia.\nThe highly coordinated cyber campaign utilized vetted target lists of Georgian govern-\nment websites as well as other strategically valuable sites, including the U.S. And British\nembassies. Each site was vetted in terms of whether it could be attacked from Russian\nor Lithuanian IP addresses. Attack vectors included DDoS, SQL injection, and cross-\nsite scripting (XSS).\nIran\nThe Iranian Presidential elections of 2009 spawned a massive public protest against\nelection fraud that was fueled in large part by the availability of social media such as\nTwitter and Facebook as outlets for public protest.

Pete\nHoekstra (R-MI) has called for the U.S. military to launch a cyber attack against the\nDPRK to send them a “strong signal.”\nCyber Espionage\nActs of cyber espionage are far more pervasive than acts of cyber warfare, and the\nleading nation that is conducting cyber espionage campaigns on a global scale is the\nPeople’s Republic of China.\nIn December 2007, Jonathan Evans, the director-general of MI5, informed 300 British\ncompanies that they were “under attack by Chinese organizations,” including the Peo-\nple’s Liberation Army.\nTitan Rain\n“Titan Rain” is the informal code name for ongoing acts of Chinese cyber espionage\ndirected against the U.S. Department of Defense since 2002. According to Lieutenant\nGeneral William Lord, the Air Force’s Chief of Warfighting Integration and Chief In-\nformation Officer, “China has downloaded 10 to 20 terabytes of data from the NIPRNet\n(DOD’s Non-Classified IP Router Network).” This stolen data came from such agencies\nas the U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command, The Naval Ocean Sys-\ntems Center, the Missile Defense Agency, and Sandia National Laboratories.\nAccording to testimony by Timothy L. Thomas (Lt. Col., USA Retired) of the Foreign\nMilitary Studies Office, Joint Reserve Intelligence Office, Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas,\nbefore the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission in 2008, DOD\ncomputers experienced a 31% increase in malicious activity over the previous year,\namounting to 43,880 incidents.\nIn 2006, Department of Defense officials claimed that the Pentagon network backbone,\nknown as the Global Information Grid, was the recipient of 3 million daily scans, and\nthat China and the U.S. were the top two sources.\nActs of cyber espionage are not only directed at U.S. Government websites but also at\nprivate companies that do classified work on government contracts.

Indeed, all of these entities could\nhave been involved in the attacks at the same time. This is because the differentiation\nbetween Cyber Crime, Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terror can be a misleading one—in\nreality, Cyber Terror is often Cyber Warfare utilizing Cyber Crime.\n—Alexander Klimburg, Cyber-Attacken als Warnung (DiePresse.com, July 15, 2009)\nMost of the sources on cyber warfare that are publicly available do not address the\nproblem of cyber crime. The reasoning goes that one is a military problem, whereas the\nother is a law enforcement problem; hence these two threats are dealt with by different\nagencies that rarely speak with one another.\nUnfortunately, this approach is not only counterproductive, but it also creates serious\ninformation gaps in intelligence gathering and analysis. My experience as Principal\nInvestigator of the open source intelligence effort Project Grey Goose provides ample\nevidence that many of the non-state hackers who participated in the Georgian and Gaza\ncyber wars were also involved in cyber crime. It was, in effect, their “day job.”\nAdditionally, cyber crime is the laboratory where the malicious payloads and exploits\nused in cyber warfare are developed, tested, and refined. The reason why it is such an\neffective lab environment is because cracking a secure system, whether it’s Heartland\nPayment Systems or the Global Information Grid, is valuable training, and it’s hap-\npening every day inside the cyber underground.\nThe chart in Figure 1-1, prepared by independent security researcher Jart Armin, dem-\nonstrates the rapid rise in volume and sophistication of attacks in just the last 10 years.\nA 2009 report by Gartner Research states that financial fraud was up by 47% in 2008\nfrom 2007, with 687 data breaches reported. What does that translate to in dollars? No\none seems to know, although Chris Hoofnagle, Senior Fellow with the Berkeley Center\nfor Law and Technology, says in an article that he wrote for the Fall 2007 issue of the\nHarvard Journal of Law and Technology that it’s probably in the tens of billions:\nCurrently we don’t know the scope of the problem…. We do know that it is a big problem\nand that the losses are estimated in the tens of billions. Without reporting, we cannot\ntell whether the market is addressing the problem.

This could be caused by natural disasters, hardware failures, rupture of\nsubmarine cables (there were 50 incidents recorded in the Atlantic Ocean in 2007 alone),\nas well as from human actions such as terrorism or cyber attacks, which are becoming\nmore and more sophisticated.\nThe commission goes on to recommend an increased focus in key areas to counter\nfuture threats in cyberspace. These include:\nPreparedness and prevention\nFostering cooperation of information and transfer of good policy practices between\nmember states via a European Forum Establishing a European Public-Private Part-\nnership for Resilience, which will help businesses share experience and information\nwith public authorities.\nDetection and response\nSupporting the development of a European information-sharing and alert system.\nMitigation and recovery\nStimulating stronger cooperation between member states via national and multi-\nnational contingency plans and regular exercises for large-scale network security\nincident response and disaster recovery.\nInternational cooperation\nDriving a Europe-wide debate to set EU priorities for the long-term resilience and\nstability of the Internet with a view to proposing principles and guidelines to be\npromoted internationally.\nEstablish criteria for European critical infrastructure in the Information and Communi-\ncation Technologies (ICT) sector\nThe criteria and approaches currently vary across member states.\nIncreasing Awareness\nThe potential impact of attacks delivered in cyberspace has not always been as\nappreciated as it is today.

Nobody argues—or at least no sane person argues—\nthat a cyber attack could lead to mass casualties. It’s not in any way comparable to\nweapons of mass destruction. In fact, what a lot of people call them is “weapons of mass\nannoyance.” If your power goes out for a couple hours, if somebody draws a mustache\non Attorney General Ashcroft’s face on his website, it’s annoying.

Part of the reason for various respected individuals such as James\nLewis to downplay the potential impact of cyber war is that past examples have not\ndemonstrated any significant harm. Website defacements and extended downtime of\na small country’s Internet access, while burdensome, have not resulted in human\ninjuries.\nEven in 2009, when there is little doubt remaining about the critical need to address\ncyber vulnerabilities, there are still voices of dissent such as Jim Harper, director of\ninformation policy studies at the CATO Institute, who said in an interview with Russia\nToday on July 31, 2009 that “Both cyber terrorism and cyber warfare are concepts that\nare gross exaggerations of what’s possible through Internet attacks.”\nAlthough acts of cyber espionage such as Titan Rain or incidents of cyber crime re-\nsulting in major data losses such as Heartland Payment Systems are gravely serious in\ntheir own right, stove-piped thinking that excludes cyber crime from cyber war means\nthat the potential for a threat case doesn’t cross over in the mind of the military\nstrategist.\nCritical Infrastructure\nThere is a growing awareness of the vulnerability of a nation’s critical infrastructure to\nnetwork attack. Transportation, banking, telecommunications, and energy are among\nthe most vulnerable systems and may be subject to the following modes of attack:\n• Insider threats\n• Anonymous access to protected networks via the Internet and Supervisory Control\nand Data Acquisition (SCADA)\n• Counterfeit hardware\n• Employee abuse of security guidelines leading to malware propagation inside the\nfirewall\nThe following future threat scenario is modeled after the ones created for the latest\nNational Intelligence Council (NIC) report “Global Trends 2025.” While containing\nmany scenarios on a variety of national security issues, the NIC did not include a large-\nscale cyber event. The authors did, however, have this to say:\n8 | Chapter 1: Assessing the Problem\nCyber and sabotage attacks on critical US economic, energy, and transportation infra-\nstructures might be viewed by some adversaries as a way to circumvent US strengths on\nthe battlefield and attack directly US interests at home.\nWhat follows is my offering to stimulate discussion and raise awareness within the\nNational Security community of what is possible in the cyber realm.\nThe question of whether a nuclear catastrophe could be initiated by a\nhacker attack was explored through multiple scenarios in a paper com-\nmissioned by the International Commission on Nuclear Nonprolifera-\ntion and Disarmament entitled “Hacking Nuclear Command and Con-\ntrol” by Jason Fritz, et al.\nFuture Scenario Involving Critical Infrastructure\nOctober 19, 20**\nChairperson\nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\nWashington, D.C.\nRE: Establishment of North American Urgent Radiological Information Exchange\nMadame Chairperson:\nWhile we do not believe that this is a matter that rightfully falls under the province of\nyour Committee, in the interest of cooperation, this letter will address the events leading\nup to the establishment of the North American Urgent Radiological Information Ex-\nchange (NAURIE).\nAs you know, on the nth year anniversary of 9/11, all of our nation’s nuclear power\nplants were targeted in a massive distributed denial of service attack orchestrated by\nthe Conficker D botnet, which had grown to a heretofore unheard of 30,000,000+\ninfected hosts.\nWhile US CERT teams as well as regional DOE cyber security personnel were focused\non combating this external threat, each plant’s internal firewall separating the Com-\nmand and Safety System Networks from the Site Local Area Network was breached\nfrom the inside due to the use of pirated hardware with malicious embedded code that\npassed server control to external users.\nFuture Threats | 9\nOf even more concern is the fact that all of these plants were targets of a carefully\nplanned, long-term social engineering attack that relied on human error and the broad-\nbased appeal of social network sites. As DOE employees broke protocol and down-\nloaded phony social software apps, malicious code worked its way into secure networks\nand lay dormant until activated by the attacking force.\nThis led to a number of consecutive failures in our safety mechanisms resulting in partial\nto complete core meltdowns at 70% of our plants. When these plants went offline, the\nnation’s power requirements couldn’t be met. Grids were overwhelmed and blackouts\nbegan occurring in our most heavily populated urban areas. Once criminal gangs real-\nized that overburdened police departments were unable to respond to every 911 call,\nlooting of businesses began in earnest as did home invasions in the wealthier\nneighborhoods.\nOne year later, we still do not have a final count on the number of deaths and casualties\nbut most responsible estimates place them in the tens of thousands. If we extrapolate\nout for the as yet unknown future effects of radiation poisoning on the victims, the\ncount goes into six figures.\nWhile this is clearly a tragedy on every level, I feel I must point out that the NNSA, as\nlate as 2009, in a letter to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, did its part in improving\nsecurity by determining that the loss of 83 LANL laptops should no longer be consid-\nered just a “property management” issue, but a cyber security issue as well.\nAlso, our G3 physical security model (Gates, Guards, Guns) was not compromised,\nand cyber security compliance has never been a mandatory policy; instead it is an on-\ngoing negotiation among various other considerations.\nv/r,\nDirector, National Nuclear Security Agency\nThis scenario is perfectly plausible given what we know today about software exploits\ndriven by social engineering; the availability of counterfeit hardware such as routers,\nswitches, Gigabit Interface Converters, and WAN interface cards; and Conficker-type\nbotnets that consist of millions of infected PCs.\nCombine those threats with a motivated, patient, and well-financed hacker crew and\nany number of doomsday scenarios become possible.\nIf this scenario sounds far-fetched or seems to overstate the risk, the following news\nstories represent a sampling of actual cyber security events that have occurred at nuclear\npower plants since 2003:\n“NNSA wants more funding for cyber security” (Federal Computer Week, February 6,\n2008)\n“Numerous cybersecurity problems at the department have come to light over the\npast few months. A recently released report by the department’s inspector general\nreport said Energy had 132 serious security breaches in fiscal 2006.”\n10 | Chapter 1: Assessing the Problem\n“Slammer worm crashed Ohio nuke power plant” (SecurityFocus, August, 19, 2003)\n“The Slammer worm penetrated a private computer network at Ohio’s Davis-Besse\nnuclear power plant in January and disabled a safety monitoring system for nearly\nfive hours, despite a belief by plant personnel that the network was protected by a\nfirewall, SecurityFocus has learned.”\n“Cyber Incident Blamed for Nuclear Power Plant Shutdown” (The Washington Post,\nJune 5, 2008)\n“A nuclear power plant in Georgia was recently forced into an emergency shut-\ndown for 48 hours after a software update was installed on a single computer.\nAccording to a report filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, when the\nupdated computer rebooted, it reset the data on the control system, causing safety\nsystems to errantly interpret the lack of data as a drop in water reservoirs that cool\nthe plant’s radioactive nuclear fuel rods. As a result, automated safety systems at\nthe plant triggered a shutdown.”\n“Fed aims to tighten nuclear cyber security” (SecurityFocus, January 25, 2005)\n“The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) quietly launched a public com-\nment period late last month on a proposed 15-page update to its regulatory guide\n‘Criteria for Use of Computers in Safety Systems of Nuclear Power Plants.’ The\ncurrent version, written in 1996, is three pages long and makes no mention of\nsecurity.\nAdherence to the new guidelines would be strictly voluntary for operators of the\n103 nuclear reactors already running in the U.S.—a detail that irks some security\nexperts. In filed comments, Joe Weiss, a control systems cyber security consultant\nat KEMA, Inc., argued the regulatory guide shouldn’t be limited to plant safety\nsystems, and that existing plants should be required to comply.\n“There have been numerous cases of control system cyber security impacts in-\ncluding several in commercial nuclear plants,” Weiss wrote. “Many nuclear plants\nhave connected their plant networks to corporate networks making them poten-\ntially vulnerable to cyber intrusions.”\n“Congressmen Want Explanation on Possible Nuclear Power Plant Cyber Security In-\ncident” (SC Magazine, May 21, 2007)\n“U.S. Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the House Committee on\nHomeland Security, and Rep. James R. Langevin, D-R.I., chairman of the Sub-\ncommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology, have\nasked Dale E. Klein, chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),\nto investigate the nation’s nuclear cybersecurity infrastructure.\nThey said a cybersecurity ‘incident’ resembling a DoS attack on Aug. 19, 2006 left\nthe Browns Ferry Unit 3 nuclear power facility in northern Alabama at risk.”\nBesides the risks posed by various malicious attacks, both real and projected, a further\ncomplication that must be considered is the significant age of most of our nuclear power\nplants and how difficult it will be to rid a legacy network of a virus.\nFuture Threats | 11"

If there’s a known good source available, a reinstall should work; how-\never, do these antiquated systems even have a known good source? How does a nuclear\npower plant take all of its critical systems offline? Much of the software used in critical\ninfrastructures in the U.S. were custom-made one-off versions. After infection occurs,\nthe likelihood of a kernel-level rootkit remaining on the machine is worrisome at best,\nand catastrophic at worst.\nThe Conficker Worm: The Cyber Equivalent of an Extinction\nEvent?\nPerhaps the most obvious frightening aspect of Conficker C is its clear potential to do\nharm.

They are also adept at\ncode obfuscation and code packing, and they are closely monitoring and adapting to\nattempts to thwart Conficker’s operation.\nPerhaps more importantly, the Conficker authors have shown that they are innovative,\nagile, and quick to implement improvements in their worm. Quoting from the SRI\nreport:\nThey are among the first to introduce the Internet rendezvous point scheme, and have\nnow integrated a sophisticated P2P protocol that does not require an embedded peer list.\nThey have continually seeded the Internet with new MD5 variants, and have adapted\ntheir code base to address the latest attempts to thwart Conficker. They have infiltrated\ngovernment sites, military networks, home PCs, critical infrastructure, small networks,\nand universities, around the world. Perhaps an even greater threat than what they have\ndone so far, is what they have learned and what they will build next.\n12 | Chapter 1: Assessing the Problem"

The site of Georgian President Saakashvili was simul-\ntaneously attacked from 500 IP-addresses. When the initially used addresses were\nblocked, the attacks resumed from others.

He then carefully states the Russian response,\ni.e., “the response followed shortly.” Since the subject of this exchange is two states\nwarring, “the response followed shortly” implies a state response rather than a spon-\ntaneous grassroots action of so-called hactivists.\nTsyganok’s depiction of events manages to underscore the Russian government’s\npractice of distancing itself from the nationalistic hacker community, thus gaining de-\nniability while passively supporting and enjoying the strategic benefits of their actions.\nThe Foundation for Effective Politics’ War on the Net (Day One)\nPravada.ru printed an article by Maksim Zharov of the Foundation for Effective Politics\n(FEP) entitled “Russia Versus Georgia: War on the Net—Day One” on August 9, 2008.\nZharov is also one of the authors of the book Chronicles of Information Warfare and\nused to work for Nikita Ivanov, then deputy chief of the Administration for Interre-\ngional and Cultural Ties With Foreign Countries of the President’s Staff and supervisor\nof the pro-Kremlin youth movements (i.e., Nashi). (Zharov earlier published (through\nYevropa) an instruction manual for bloggers who want to “fight the enemies of Russia”\nin the blogosphere.)\nThe Foundation for Effective Politics is a Kremlin-friendly organization created by Gleb\nPavlovsky, one of the earliest adopters of the Russian Internet for state propaganda\npurposes. You can read more on Pavlovsky and the FEP in Chapter 11.\nThe Russian Information War | 17\nZharov comments on the use of the Russian youth movements to wage warfare on the\nNet. This was repeated by the administrator of the StopGeorgia.ru forum in the fol-\nlowing announcement to its membership on August 9, 2008, at 3:08 p.m.:\nLet me remind you that on August 8, leaders of several Russian youth movements have\nsigned the statement which calls for supporters to wage information war against the\nPresident of Georgia Michael Saakashvili on all Internet resources.\nZharov elaborates on this fact by referring to an event in the city of Krasnoyarsk where\na joint statement by the leaders of Russian youth movements announced:\nWe declare information war on the Saakashvili regime. The Internet should oppose\nAmerican-Georgian propaganda which is based on double standards.\nHe names Nashi as one such organization whose leaders have close ties with the Krem-\nlin and whose members have been involved in these Internet wars, both in Estonia and\nGeorgia.\nInternet warfare, according to Zharov, was started by Georgian hackers attacking South\nOssettian websites on August 7, one day before the Russian invasion.\nThe South Ossetian site http://cominf.org reported in the afternoon of August 7 that\nbecause of a DDoS attack, the Ossetian sites were often inaccessible for long periods.\nIn order to relieve them, an additional site, tskhinval.ru, had to be set up. In addition,\na fake site of the Osinform news agency, http://www.os-inform.com, created by Georgia,\nappeared.\nZharov’s personal preference for information about the Georgian war was LiveJournal,\nknown in Russian as ZhZh (Zhivoy Zhurnal), particularly the georgia_war community.\nIt contained, in Zharov’s words, “a fairly objective indicator of the state of affairs on\nthe Internet front, in which the most diverse opinions are published.”\nOne of the more interesting things that Zharov wrote in “Russia Versus Georgia: War\non the Net. Day Three,” published in Moscow Pravda.ru in Russian August 11, 2008,\nwas his conjecture about which nation had the capability to launch a DDoS attack of\nthe size seen during the five-day war:\nIn general, many people are forming the impression that these attacks are certainly not\nthe work of Georgian hackers.\nAnd to be honest, I do not believe that the Russian military have a special service that\nswamped all of the Georgian websites even more quickly on the very day of the unex-\npected attacks by the Georgians.\nHowever, in the United States, such sub-units of cyber troops were created many years\nago (emphasis added).\nSo Zharov acknowledges their involvement in organizing an “information war” against\nGeorgia, but he completely ignores their involvement in the cyber war, and he instead\nspeculates that the only military force that has the capability of “swamping all of Geor-\ngian websites” so quickly is that of the United States. This serves as another example\nof the Kremlin strategy in making the cyber war debate about military capabilities rather\n18 | Chapter 2: The Rise of the Non-State Hacker"

Arab and Muslim hackers mobilized\nto attack Danish and Dutch websites in 2006 during the Prophet cartoon controversy.\nA small-scale “cyber war” also erupted between Shiite and Sunni Muslims in the fall of\n2008, as predominantly Arab Sunni Muslims and Iranian Shiite Muslims worked to\ndeface or disrupt websites associated with one another’s sects.\nThe latest example of this occurred when Israel began a military assault on Hamas’s\ninfrastructure in Gaza on December 27, 2008, called Operation Cast Lead. After almost\na month into the operation, Palestinian officials declared the death toll had topped\n1,000, and media reports carried images of massive property destruction and civilian\ncasualties. This provoked outrage in the Arab and Muslim communities, which man-\nifested itself in a spike of anti-Semitic incidents around the world, calls for violent\nattacks on Jewish interests worldwide, and cyber attacks on Israeli websites.\nThe exact number of Israeli or other websites that have been disrupted by hackers is\nunknown, but the number is well into the thousands. According to one estimate, the\nnumber reached 10,000 by the first week of January 2009 alone. Most attacks are simple\nwebsite defacements, whereby hackers infiltrate the site, leaving behind their own\ngraffiti throughout the site or on the home page. The hackers’ graffiti usually contains\nmessages of protest against the violence in Gaza, as well as information about the\nhackers, such as their handles and country of origin. The majority of cyber attacks\nlaunched in protest of Operation Cast Lead were website defacements. There is no data\nto indicate more sophisticated or dangerous kinds of cyber attacks, such as those that\ncould cause physical harm or injury to people.\nImpact\nWhile media coverage focuses on the most high-profile hacks or defacements, this\ncurrent cyber campaign is a “war of a thousand cuts,” with the cumulative impact on\nthousands of small businesses, vanity websites, and individual websites likely out-\nweighing the impact of more publicized, larger exploits.\nHowever, successfully compromising higher-profile websites not only brings more\npublic attention, it also compels businesses all over Israel to preventively tighten se-\ncurity, which costs money. For that reason the financial impact of infiltrating a few\nlarger corporate websites may be as important as disrupting thousands of smaller sites.\nThe Gaza Cyber War Between Israeli and Arabic Hackers During Operation Cast Lead | 19\nHigh-profile attacks or defacements between December 27, 2008, and February 15,\n2009, include:\nYnetnews.com\nThe English language portal of one of Israel’s largest newspapers.

Traffic was redir-\nected to a site with a protest message in jumbled English. Ynetnews.com empha-\nsized that its site had not actually been “hacked,” but that Team Evil obtained a\npassword allowing them to access a server. The Team then changed the IP ad-\ndresses for different domain names, sending users attempting to access Ynet\nnews.com to a domain containing their message.\nDiscount Bank, one of the three largest banks in Israel, also had its website was\nalso registered with DomainTheNet, and Team Evil switched its IP address just as\nthey did with Ynetnews.\nIsrael’s Cargo Airlines Ltd.\nAn Israeli airline defaced by hackers.\nKadima.org.il\nThe website of Israel’s Kadima party was defaced twice during this period.\nDZ team, based in Algeria, was responsible for the first defacement, in which they\nadorned the Kadima’s home page with photos of IDF soldiers’ funerals, accom-\npanied by messages in Arabic and Hebrew promising that more Israelis would die.\nThe second time occurred on February 13, 2009, three days after close parliamen-\ntary elections in which Kadima and Likud both claimed victory and hackers could\nexpect a spike in traffic to the Kadima website. Gaza Hacker Team claimed re-\nsponsibility for the second defacement.\nEhudbarak.org.il (This URL is no longer active.)\nIsraeli Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Barak’s website was\ndefaced by Iranian hackers who call themselves Ashianeh Security Team.

So far, however, neither the\nmessages left behind on defaced sites nor conversations among hackers on their own\nwebsites explicitly indicates membership in Hezbollah or other Islamist groups. The\nhackers involved do not have any unifying body organizing their activities, although\nsome of them congregate in certain specialized hacker forums.\nMany active hackers during the current Gaza crisis are experienced. Some of them were\ninvolved in the Sunni-Shiite cyber conflict that intensified in the fall of 2008. Others\nhave numerous apolitical hacks under their belts. Their participation in the current,\npolitically motivated hacking of Israel websites is a reflection of their personal political\nfeelings and/or recognition of the increased attention that they can attract with Gaza-\nrelated hacks.\nThe majority of the graffiti left behind on Israel websites contains images of the victims\nand destruction in Gaza and exhortations to Israel and/or the United States to stop the\nviolence. The most common motivation of the hackers appears to be to draw attention\nto the plight of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and to register their protest against\nIsraeli actions there. In the words of two hackers interviewed by a Turkish newspaper,\n“Our goal is to protest what is being done to the innocent people in Gaza and show\nour reaction. The reason we chose this method was our bid to make our voices louder.”\nMotivations\nThe imagery and text left on defaced websites suggests the importance the hackers place\non sending messages to Israeli or Western audiences through their attacks. The owner\nof a Palestinian graphic design company designed images for hackers to use in their\ndefacements.

The group defaced\nmore than 8,000 websites between June and November 2006. In addition to Israeli and\nWestern sites, this tally also included websites associated with the governments of\nChina, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia. In all, Team Evil defaced 171 significant websites,\naccording to records on Zone h, a website that serves as an archive of hacker exploits.\nThe team often left anti-Israel or anti-Semitic messages on their defacements, regardless\nof the country of origin of the website.\nIsrael’s Ynetnews reported that Team Evil was responsible for the majority of damage\nto Israeli websites in the first half of 2006, including sites belonging to banks, hospitals,\nmajor companies, NGOs, and political parties. When Ynetnews contacted the group,\nits members told the paper that they were Moroccan hackers who “hack into sites as\npart of the resistance in the war with Israel.”\nThe group has resurfaced to take part in the current campaign against Israeli websites,\nbut it is not as active as it was in 2006.

All other types of attacks, according to Li\nXiaodong, deputy director of the China Internet Network Information Center\n(CNNIC), fall into a “grey area.”\nSimilarly, in the Russian Federation, the police are interested only in arresting hackers\nfor financial crimes against Russian companies.

    "output": "CHAPTER 3\nThe Legal Status of Cyber Warfare\nAlthough cyber warfare has been around for a decade or so, it still has not been well\ndefined. As of this writing, there is no international treaty in place that establishes a\nlegal definition for an act of cyber aggression. In fact, the entire field of international\ncyber law is still murky.\nThe NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) published a\npaper on the subject in November 2008 entitled “Cyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal\nLessons Identified.” In it, the authors discuss possible applicability of the Law of Armed\nConflict (LOAC) to the cyber attacks that occurred during the Russian Georgia War\nof August 2008.\nLOAC, also known as the International Humanitarian Law, relies on two primary rule\ngroups: jus ad bellum and jus ad bello, which is Latin for “justice to war” and “justice\nin war,” respectively. In other words, there are rules for how a country proceeds to a\nstate of war and, once there, for how it conducts its war effort.\nOn May 8, 2009, the head of the U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Air Force General Kevin\nP. Chilton, was quoted in Stars and Stripes as saying “[t]he Law of Armed Conflict will\napply to this domain.” It is still unclear how many other nations will adopt that same\napproach, particularly the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China.\nAmit Sharma, deputy director of India’s Ministry of Defense—Defense Research and\nDevelopment Organization, prefers a different approach, one styled after the Mutually\nAssured Destruction (MAD) model of nuclear deterrence:\nYou can talk endlessly about the law of armed conflict, but a treaty would not be ach-\nieved.... The only viable solution is one of cyber deterrence.\nAccording to a June 27, 2009, New York Times article entitled “U.S. and Russia Differ\non a Treaty for Cyberspace”:\nRussia favors an international treaty along the lines of those negotiated for chemical\nweapons and has pushed for that approach at a series of meetings this year and in public\nstatements by a high-ranking official.\n31"

If these groups cooperate to\nmake cyberspace more secure against criminal intrusions, their work will also make\ncyberspace more secure against military campaigns, American officials say.\nThese areas of dispute are reflected in the multiple faces of cyber aggression:\n• Cyber attacks against government or critical civilian websites or networks without\naccompanying military force\n• Cyber attacks against government or critical civilian websites or networks with\naccompanying military force\n• Cyber attacks against internal political opponents\n• Cyber intrusions into critical infrastructure and networks\n• Acts of cyber espionage\nHow many of these real-world attacks should be considered acts of cyber warfare? All?\nNone? Only those that can be attributed directly to a nation state?\nThe first thing to realize is that legally there is no such concept as an act of war, cyber\nor otherwise. The UN Charter lays out when a nation state can use force in self-defense\nagainst an act of aggression, but it refers entirely to armed conflict. Other treaties may\nprovide a better framework for establishing definitions for cyber aggression, and these\nare thoroughly examined in a 2009 paper by Scott Shackleford entitled “From Nuclear\nWar to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law,” published in the\nBerkeley Journal of International Law (BJIL), Vol 25 No 3.\nShackleford lists a few treaty regimes that may be useful in constructing an international\ncyber treaty:\n• Nuclear nonproliferation treaties\n• The Antarctic Treaty System and Space law\n• United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)\n• Mutual Legal Assistance Agreements (MALT)\nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaties\nNuclear nonproliferation treaties are designed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons\nat the very earliest stages of development, i.e., at the nuclear reactor level. They were\nused most recently in Iran when it refused to fully cooperate with the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nNonproliferation treaties work because the components of creating a nuclear device\nare highly restricted and closely monitored by the IAEA as well as by various govern-\nments that have their own agencies monitoring such activities (e.g., U.S. Nuclear Emer-\ngency Support Team [NEST]).\n32 | Chapter 3: The Legal Status of Cyber Warfare"

    "output": "Unfortunately, the genie is already out of the bottle when it comes to the components\nof cyber warfare. Everything that an attacker needs is in wide distribution and freely\navailable or available at a reasonable price. That pretty much kills the effectiveness of\nany proposed nonproliferation-type treaty aimed at keeping states from engaging in or\ndeveloping a cyber warfare capability.\nWhile there has been some hyperbole on the part of military officials in Russia and the\nUnited States around the issue of scale and proportionality in response to a large-scale\ncyber attack,* neither nation has a policy to deal with it.\nCan a cyber attack rise to the level of a nuclear attack? Not in and of itself, but a\nsufficiently large-scale cyber attack that takes down critical networks and in turn results\nin systemic failures of safety systems at nuclear power plants could have devastating\nconsequences, including loss of life.\nThe Antarctic Treaty System and Space Law\nCyberspace has frequently been compared to outer space, as both are boundless and\nunregulated. Surprisingly, there is no prohibition against using outer space as a weap-\nons platform unless it involves the use of nuclear weapons, which is prohibited by\ninternational treaty, and/or such weapons are placed on a planetary body such as the\nMoon, which is also prohibited. The void in between, however, is still unregulated.\nOne of the obstacles in applying this analogy to cyber attacks is that few nations have\nor can reasonably expect to have the ability to wage war in outer space, whereas over\n120 nations have the ability to wage war in cyberspace. Another problem is a difference\nin the threat potential of a cyber attack compared to launching a nuclear weapon from\nspace. There is no one cyber attack that can be compared to the devastation caused by\none nuclear weapon, although theoretically the use of a mega-sized botnet like Con-\nficker C involving millions of zombie computers might come close to delivering a net-\nwork equivalent.\nAn alternative to banning a type of weapon in a domain is to ban all weapons in a\ndomain, similar to the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). Under that treaty regime, Ant-\narctica is off-limits to all types of military development by any nation and is to be used\nonly for peaceful purposes. This won’t analogize for cyber warfare because it’s impos-\nsible to differentiate between code used for peaceful purposes and code used for\nmalicious purposes.\nAnother problem with the Antarctic analogy is that there are no recognizable bounda-\nries in cyberspace and very few reliable ways to artificially create them. Recently, an\n* For example, “Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information\nwarfare, and then against the aggressor state itself” (Col. V.I.Tsymbal, 1995); cyber warfare is “a close third\nbehind the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the use by terrorists of a nuclear, biological, or\nchemical weapon” (former CIA Director John Deutch, 1996).\nThe Antarctic Treaty System and Space Law | 33"

Russia’s\nposition is that it should be modeled after the Chemical Weapons treaty or other Arms\nControl-type treaties, whereas the U.S. would prefer to engage international law en-\nforcement in cooperating more closely to catch cyber criminals.

    "output": "One Russian argument against the U.S. position was published in Moscow Military\nThought (March 31, 2007) entitled “Russian Federation Military Policy in the Area of\nInternational Information Security: Regional Aspect”:\nInternational legal acts regulating relations arising in the process of combating cyber\ncrime and cyber terrorism must not contain norms violating such immutable principles\nof international law as non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, and the\nsovereignty of the latter.\nMoreover, politically motivated cyber attacks executed on orders from governmental\nstructures can be qualified as military crimes with all the ensuing procedures of investi-\ngation and criminal persecution of the culprits. Besides, military cyber attacks can be\nconsidered as a subject of international public law. In this case, we should speak about\nimposing restrictions on development and use of computers intended to bring hostile\ninfluences to bear on objects in other states’ cyberspace.\nIn any event, the military policy in the area of international information security where\nit involves opposition to cyber terrorism and cyber crime should be directed at intro-\nducing international legal mechanisms that would make it possible to contain potential\naggressors from uncontrolled and surreptitious use of cyber weapons against the Russian\nFederation and its geopolitical allies.\nClearly, Russia was formulating its policy in this area prior to 2007, and it has not\nchanged in the years since. Although the reason expressed is one of national sovereignty\nand non-interference, such a position also protects Russia’s key strategic asset in its\ncyber arsenal: its own population of highly educated, patriotic hackers who are more\nthan willing to fight on their country’s behalf in the domain of cyberspace.\nThe Law of Armed Conflict\nInterestingly, Shackleford does not address the LOAC at all in his paper, which goes\nto show just how diverse the opinions are of legal experts who focus on this field.\nInstead, he attempts to make the case that:\nThe best way to ensure a comprehensive approach to lessening the occurrence of IW is\nthrough a new international accord dealing exclusively with state-sponsored cyber at-\ntacks in international law, including the creation of a standing emergency response body\nalong the lines of WCERT proposed above. The United States should drop its opposition\nto such a treaty regime. Without such an organization, the international community will\nlurch from case-to-case with the worry that next time, the case of Estonia may resemble\nmerely a step along the way to Net War Version 2.0. When IW reaches the scale of nuclear\nwar, a new and distinct regime incorporating elements of existing international law, no-\ntably IHL, is required lest nations risk systemic infrastructure crashes that not only will\ncripple societies, but could quite possible shake the Information Age to its foundations.\nIf the LOAC is used as a guideline to determine what is and is not cyber warfare, the\nattack must conform to certain rules. First, LOAC applies only once armed conflict has\nbeen initiated. Next, cyber incidents that correspond with the armed conflict must be\nThe Law of Armed Conflict | 35\nattributable to a specific government. Then there is the issue of harmful intent. Did the\ncyber incident cause injury or damages (monetary, physical, or virtual)?\nAttribution can be direct or indirect, according to international law as interpreted in\n“Cyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified” authored by Eneken Tikk\net al. (NATO, 2008). According to Tikk and her team:\nThe governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that the\nconduct of private actors—both entities and persons—is not attributable to the state,\nunless the state has directly and explicitly delegated a part of its tasks and functions to a\nprivate entity. A shift in this rigid paradigm can be observed in the developments of recent\nyears: e.g. the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Tadic\ncase 104 and further by the international community in relation to the U.S. Operation\nEnduring Freedom in 2001. However, the current view for attribution still requires some\nform of overall control by the state.\nThe legal precedents referred to in the preceding quote are worth reading. Each follows\nwith a brief summary of its import:\nJinks, D. “State Responsibility for the Acts of Private Armed Groups,” Chicago Journal\nof International Law, 4 (2003), 83–95, p.88.\n“In the Nicaragua case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) noted that the state\nmay be held responsible for the conduct of private actors only if it executed effective\ncontrol over such actors. Hence, the ICJ could not hold the United States respon-\nsible for the conduct of the contra rebels, because the United States did not exercise\neffective control over the contras. The Court also noted that, in order for the con-\nduct of private actors to give rise to legal responsibility of the state, it would have\nto be proved that the state indeed had effective control over the conduct of private\nactors.”\nProsecutor v. Tadic - ICTY Case No. IT-94-1, 1999; Jinks, p.88–89.\n“The Tadic case lowered the threshold for imputing private acts to states and con-\ncluded that states only need to exercise overall control over private actors in order\nto attribute to the state any unlawful acts of the actors. The ICTY in its reasoning\nheld that the ‘effective control’ criterion of the ICJ was contrary to the very logic\nof state responsibility and that it was inconsistent with state and judicial practice.”\nJinks, supra note 103, p.85–87.\n“Compared to the Tadic case, the U.S. Operation Enduring Freedom in turn low-\nered the threshold for attribution because the U.S. sought to impute al Qaeda’s\nconduct to Afghanistan simply because its official regime Taliban had harboured\nand supported the terrorist group (irrespective of whether Afghanistan exercised\neffective or overall control). The international community among with several im-\nportant international organisations endorsed the U.S approach and determined\nthat under international instruments the attacks of September 11 constituted\narmed attacks which triggered the U.S inherent right of self-defence. The U.N,\nNATO and the OAS also attributed the terrorist attacks of al Qaeda to the Taliban\nregime.”\n36 | Chapter 3: The Legal Status of Cyber Warfare"

The newspaper the Australian covered the story that day, reporting:\nThe concerted attacks—which appear to originate in China, Russia and Europe as well\nas Burma—can only be the work of agents of the Burmese Government and may be an\neffort to compensate for its failure last year to stem the flow of images showing vast\ncolumns of unarmed demonstrators and their eventual dispersal under a rain of bullets\nand truncheons.\nA representative of DVB reported that the attacks appeared to be coming from sites in\nRussia and China, which, if true, would indicate that the Myanmar government out-\nsourced the attacks.\nCyber: The Chaotic Domain\nThe answer to the question posed earlier about which of the previously discussed events\nqualifies as an act of cyber war is “none of the above.” As of this writing, there is no\nlegal entity known as “cyber war”; the only issue that has been defined by international\nagreement is a nation’s right to self-defense when attacked, and that applies only to the\ntraditional manner of attack, i.e., “armed” attack.\nThe assortment of cyber attacks listed earlier, ranging from internal attempts to silence\nopposition movements (Zimbabwe, Kyrgyzstan) to state-employed hackers taking out\nstrategic websites (Israel, the Palestinian National Authority), illustrates just how\nmalleable this domain can be. Furthermore, it would be incredibly naive to think that\nevery permutation of this domain has been seen by now, which raises the importance\nof regular war-gaming or other types of forward-thinking exercises. This, unfortunately,\nis not a universally agreed-upon strategy.\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) issued a report in February\n2009 entitled “The 20 most important controls and metrics for effective cyber defense\nand continuous FISMA compliance.” The following appeared in the report:\nA central tenet of the US Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) is that\n“offense must inform defense.” In other words, knowledge of actual attacks that have\ncompromised systems provides the essential foundation on which to construct effective\ndefenses. The US Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee moved\nto make this same tenet central to the Federal Information Security Management Act in\ndrafting FISMA 2008. That new proposed legislation calls upon Federal agencies to:\nEstablish security control testing protocols that ensure that the information infrastructure\nof the agency, including contractor information systems operating on behalf of the agency,\nare effectively protected against known vulnerabilities, attacks, and exploitations (emphasis\nadded).\nCyber: The Chaotic Domain | 39\nThis is an extremely short-sighted approach to security. A tier-one hacker’s favorite\npursuit is the discovery of a zero-day exploit, which means finding a vulnerability in\nthe software that no one else has yet discovered. To look only to the past as a defensive\nstrategy means that our cyber security protocols will always be playing catch-up.\nWith the risk of discovery almost nil, a disputed legal status, and little in the way of\nunified international law enforcement collaboration, the cyber domain is today’s equiv-\nalent of the untamed American West during the 1800s. Keyboards have replaced re-\nvolvers and hackers are the new gunslingers. However, as with the other analogies, this\none breaks down in one important respect: land is a physical, three-dimensional entity,\nand cyberspace is an electronic terrain that does not occupy physical space, yet through\nit flows ever-increasing amounts of data that may control physical processes.\nFrom an adversary’s point of view, this is an ideal fighting ground. He can enter it\nunseen to conduct espionage or offensive attacks and escape without fear of being\ndetected. The cost of entry is low, and a single person can have a significant impact\n(with the help of a botnet that can be rented or purchased). Furthermore, in many\ncountries, including the U.S., cyber attacks defenses are scattered, uneven, and lack\nany coordination or consistency. As of this writing, political infighting and the elevation\nof economic and health care challenges in the Obama White House have pushed the\nissue of cyber security so far down the priority ladder that one prime candidate after\nanother is announcing his lack of interest in the position of cyber coordinator that\nPresident Obama announced in early 2009.

Service and MOD civilian personnel are encouraged to talk about what they do,\nbut within certain limits to protect security, reputation and privacy. An increas-\ningly important channel for this engagement, and to keep in touch with family and\nfriends is social media (such as social networking sites, blogs and other internet\nself-publishing). Personnel may make full use of these but must:\n• Follow the same high standards of conduct and behaviour online as would be\nexpected elsewhere;\n• Always maintain personal, information and operational security and be careful\nabout the information they share online;\n• Get authorisation from their chain of command when appropriate (see para 2\nbelow);\n2.

Sklerov\nOne of the most heavily debated issues in international law is when states may lawfully\nrespond to cyber attacks in self-defense. While the law of war is comprised of well-\nknown and widely accepted principles, applying these principles to cyber attacks is a\ndifficult task. This difficulty arises out of the fact that the law of war developed, for the\nmost part, in response to conventional wars between states. When evaluating armed\n* The views expressed in this chapter are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of the\nDepartment of Defense. The author would like to thank Major J. Jeremy Marsh, Judge Advocate General’s\nCorps, U.S. Air Force, for his invaluable assistance during his research into cyber warfare.\n45\nattacks in that paradigm, it was easy to assess the scope of an attack and the identity\nof an attacker. Unfortunately, when a cyber attack is in progress, it becomes difficult\nfor states to assess the scope of an attack or figure out who is responsible for it. These\ndifficulties have made states reluctant to respond to cyber attacks in self-defense for\nfear of violating the law of war, and they have turned cyber warfare into one of the\nhottest topics in international law.\nThis chapter explores the unique challenges that cyber attacks pose to the law of war\nand provides an analytical framework for dealing with them. Once the current state of\nthe law of war is fully explored, this chapter will demonstrate that states have a right\nunder international law to:\n1. View and respond to cyber attacks as acts of war and not solely as criminal matters.\n2. Use active, not just passive, defenses† against the computer networks in other\nstates, that may or may not have initiated an attack, but have neglected their duty\nto prevent cyber attacks from within their borders.\nAs this book is primarily intended to address the technical aspects of cyber warfare, the\npurpose of this chapter is to provide readers with a basic understanding of the law of\nwar as it relates to cyber warfare and to demonstrate that there is a sound legal basis\nfor states to respond to cyber attacks in self-defense. For a more detailed legal discussion\nfilled with legal citations and factual research, I suggest reading my article on cyber\nwarfare in the Fall 2009 edition of the Military Law Review. Furthermore, there are a\nnumber of policy-making implications that naturally flow from the conclusions of this\nchapter, which shall not be fully addressed here.\nThis chapter is broken down into several sections for ease of reading. First, it reviews\nthe legal problems that states encounter when dealing with cyber attacks, and why\ncurrent interpretations of the law of war actually endanger states. Second, it lays out\nthe basic framework for analyzing armed attacks. Third, it explores the challenges that\nnon-state actors present to the basic framework of the law of war. Fourth, it analyzes\ncyber attacks under the law of war and demonstrates that victim-states have a right to\nrespond with force against host-states that neglect their duty to prevent cyber attacks.\nFinally, it examines the choice to use force, explains why active defenses are the most\nappropriate use of force under the law of war, and describes the legal problems that\nstates will face when using active defenses.\n†Active defenses are electronic countermeasures designed to strike attacking computer systems and shut down\ncyber attacks midstream. Security professionals can set up active defenses to automatically respond to attacks\nagainst critical systems, or they can carry them out manually. For the most part, active defenses are classified,\nthough programs that send destructive viruses back to the perpetrator’s machine or packet-flood the\nintruder’s machine have entered the public domain. Passive defenses are the traditional forms of computer\nsecurity used to defend computer networks, such as system access controls, data access controls, security\nadministration, and secure system design.\n46 | Chapter 4: Responding to International Cyber Attacks As Acts of War"

    "output": "The Legal Dilemma\nGiven the potentially catastrophic consequences that cyber attacks can cause, it is im-\nperative for states to be able to effectively defend their critical infrastructure from attack.\nThe most effective way to ward off cyber attacks is to use a layered defense of active\nand passive defenses. Unfortunately, states intentionally choose to confine their com-\nputer defenses to passive defenses alone, in part out of fear that using active defenses\nviolates the law of war.\nRight now, no comprehensive international treaty exists to regulate cyber attacks.\nConsequently, states must practice law by analogy: either equating cyber attacks to\ntraditional armed attacks and responding to them under the law of war or equating\nthem to criminal activity and dealing with them under domestic criminal laws. The\nprevailing view of states and legal scholars is that states must treat cyber attacks as a\ncriminal matter (1) out of uncertainty over whether a cyberattack can even qualify as\nan armed attack, and (2) because the law of war requires states to attribute an armed\nattack to a foreign government or its agents before responding with force.\nThis limited view of the law of war is problematic for two reasons. First, because active\ndefenses are a form of electronic force, it confines state computer defenses to passive\ndefenses alone, which weakens state defense posture. Second, it forces states to rely on\ndomestic criminal laws to deter cyber attacks, which are ineffective because several\nmajor states are unwilling to extradite or prosecute their attackers. Given these prob-\nlems with the prevailing view of the law of war, states find themselves in a “response\ncrisis” during a cyber attack, forced to decide between effective, but arguably illegal,\nactive defenses, and the less effective, but legal, passive defenses and criminal laws.\nMore than anything else, the attribution requirement perpetuates the response crisis\nbecause it is virtually impossible to attribute cyber attacks during an attack. Although\nstates can trace cyber attacks back to computer servers in another state, conclusively\nascertaining the identity of the attacker requires intensive, time-consuming investiga-\ntion with the assistance of the state of origin. Given the prohibition on responding with\nforce until an attack has been attributed to a state or its agents, coupled with the fact\nthat the vast majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it should come\nas no surprise that states are reluctant to treat cyber attacks as acts of war and risk\nviolating international law. This “attribution problem” locks states into the response\ncrisis.\nTreating cyber attacks as a criminal matter would not be problematic if passive defenses\nand criminal laws provided sufficient protection from them. Unfortunately, neither is\nadequate. While passive defenses are always the first line of defense and reduce the\nchances of a successful cyber attack, states cannot rely on them to completely secure\ntheir critical information systems. Furthermore, passive defenses do little to dissuade\nattackers from attempting their attacks in the first place. Deterrence comes from crim-\ninal laws and the penalties associated with them. However, criminal laws have proven\nto be impotent to deter international cyber attacks because several major states, such\nThe Legal Dilemma | 47"

    "output": "as China and Russia, allow their attackers to operate with impunity when their attackers\ntarget rival states.\nThe Road Ahead: A Proposal to Use Active Defenses\nTo escape this dilemma, states must use active defenses. Not only will active defenses\ngreatly improve state cyber defenses, but it logically follows that using them will serve\nas a deterrent to cyber attacks since attackers will not want to subject themselves to\ncounterattack.\nAs we’ll review in further detail later in this chapter, the legal authority for states to use\nactive defenses flows from the longstanding duty that states have to prevent non-state\nactors from using their territory to commit cross-border attacks. Traditionally, this duty\nonly required states to prevent illegal acts that the state knew about beforehand; how-\never, this duty has evolved in response to international terrorism and now requires\nstates to act against groups generally known to carry out illegal acts. In the realm of\ncyber warfare, this duty should be interpreted to require states to enact and enforce\ncriminal laws to deter cross-border cyber attacks. Otherwise, the current situation that\nstates face with China and Russia will continue to exist. Requiring states to enact and\nenforce criminal laws against cyber attacks will solve the current crisis in one of two\nways: either states will live up to their duty and start enforcing criminal laws against\nattackers, or states will violate their duty, which will create a legal pathway for victim-\nstates to hold them legally responsible for an attack without having to attribute it first.\nIn effect, repeated failure by a state to take criminal action against its attackers will\nresult in it being declared a “sanctuary state,” allowing other states to use active de-\nfenses against cyber attacks originating from within its borders.\nGiven the importance of using active defenses, it would be best if international law\ncould provide parameters regarding their proper use. After all, one of the purposes of\ninternational law is to get states to behave in predictable ways that are acceptable to\nthe international community. Thus, unless the international community wants to risk\nunpredictable and unacceptable responses to cyber attacks, international law must\nprovide guidelines for the use of active defenses. Luckily, the law of war is robust\nenough to provide guidance to states; one only needs to fully examine it.\nThe Law of War\nThe law of war is divided into two principal areas, jus ad bellum and jus in bello. Jus ad\nbellum, also known as the law of conflict management, is the legal regime governing\nthe transition from peace to war. It basically lays out when states may lawfully resort\nto armed conflict. Jus in bello, also known as the law of armed conflict, governs the\nactual use of force during war. The analysis of whether states can respond to cyber\nattacks with active defenses predominantly falls under jus ad bellum, since jus ad bel-\nlum sets forth the thresholds that cyber attacks must cross to be considered acts of war.\n48 | Chapter 4: Responding to International Cyber Attacks As Acts of War"

    "output": "Historically, the transition from peace to war fell under the prerogative of the sovereign;\nhowever, it came under international law following World War II with the ratification\nof the UN Charter. Although the UN Charter is not the only source of jus ad bellum,\nit is the starting point for all jus ad bellum analysis. The relevant articles of the UN\nCharter are Articles 2(4), 39, and 51, which provide the framework for modern jus ad\nbellum analysis.\nGeneral Prohibition on the Use of Force\nArticle 2(4) prohibits states from employing “the threat or use of force against the\nterritorial integrity or political independence of [another] state, or in any other manner\ninconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” In effect, it criminalizes both\nthe aggressive use of force and the threat of the aggressive use of force by states as crimes\nagainst international peace and security. Although the UN Charter’s protections apply\nonly to states that are parties to it, the prohibitions of Article 2(4) are so widely followed\nthat they have come to be recognized as customary international law, binding on all\nstates across the globe.\nThus, states may not threaten to use or actually use force against another state unless\nan exception is carved out within the UN Charter. This position is further supported\nby Article 2(3), which requires states to “settle their international disputes by peaceful\nmeans in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not\nendangered.” Only two exceptions exist to this seemingly all-encompassing renuncia-\ntion on the use of force: actions authorized by the UN Security Council and self-defense.\nThe First Exception: UN Security Council Actions\nThe first exception to the general prohibition on the use of force is actions authorized\nby the UN Security Council. Article 42 of the UN Charter allows the Security Council\nto use military force to restore international peace and security. However, while the\nUN Charter grants the Security Council power to use military force, the Security Coun-\ncil cannot do so until it has met the conditions of Articles 39, 41, and 42.\nArticle 39 is the first threshold that the Security Council must cross before it can au-\nthorize the use of force. It requires the Security Council to determine that a “threat to\nthe peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression” exists. Once the Security Council\ndetermines that this threshold has been met, it can attempt to restore international\npeace and security in accordance with Articles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter.\nArticle 41, the use of non-military measures, is the Charter’s preferred method for\nrestoring international peace and security. Under it, the Security Council can direct\nstates to use non-military measures to coerce an offending state into ceasing its aggres-\nsion. The non-military measures are implemented by UN member states and may in-\nclude the “complete or partial interruption of economic relations…and other means of\ncommunication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.”\nThe Law of War | 49"

    "output": "When the Security Council determines that Article 41 measures are would be pointless\nto try or have proven unsuccessful, it may authorize military measures under Article\n42. However, unlike its Article 41 powers, the Security Council may only authorize\nmember states to take military action; it cannot compel them to do so.\nThe Second Exception: Self-Defense\nThe second exception to the general prohibition on the use of force is self-defense. This\nright is enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter, which proclaims that “[n]othing in\nthe present Charter shall impair the inherent right of [states to engage in] individual or\ncollective self-defense” in response to an “armed attack.” As the text of Article 51 im-\nplies, the right of self-defense existed long before the UN Charter, and it has been\nreaffirmed by the Charter as an inherent right under customary international law. Self-\ndefense essentially stands for the proposition that states have a fundamental right to\nsurvive, and they may use force to protect themselves and their citizens. Because this\nright exists independently from the UN Charter, self-defense analysis draws on both\nthe provisions of Article 51 of the UN Charter and the principles of customary inter-\nnational law.\nThe bedrock principle of self-defense is that it may be invoked in response to an armed\nattack. Unfortunately, although this cornerstone is universally recognized under inter-\nnational law, ambiguity over the meaning of “armed attack” has led to an ongoing\ndebate about when states may invoke self-defense. This is because the Charter never\ndefines “armed attack.” Since the timing of self-defense is contingent on when an armed\nattack occurs, it is critical to resolve what constitutes an armed attack. This debate has\nbecome even more pronounced regarding cyber attacks, which are far more difficult to\nclassify than traditional attacks with conventional weapons.\nSelf-defense analysis is further complicated because of competing theories among legal\nscholars on the interplay between the UN Charter and customary international law.\nSome commentators place heavier emphasis on the UN Charter, arguing that Article\n51 limits self-defense to responses against actual armed attacks. Others place more\nemphasis on customary international law, arguing that the historical right of states to\ntreat imminent armed attacks as armed attacks is also lawful. Imminent armed attacks\nare addressed later in this chapter, but for now, it is worth noting that although there\nare different theories about the definition of an armed attack, once a state is targeted\nwith an armed attack by another state, everyone agrees the victim-state and its allies\nare legally authorized to use force against the aggressor.\nSelf-defense responses must comply with international law. Just because an armed at-\ntack has occurred against a victim-state does not mean that the victim-state has a blank\ncheck to wage unlimited war against the aggressor. Self-defense responses must be\nnecessary and proportional. Necessity means that self-defense is actually required under\nthe circumstances because a reasonable settlement could not be attained through\npeaceful means. Proportionality requires self-defense actions to be limited to the\n50 | Chapter 4: Responding to International Cyber Attacks As Acts of War"

This\nprinciple does not require the size and scope of defensive actions to be similar to those\nof the attack. A defensive action may need to employ significantly greater force than\nthe attacker used to successfully repel the attacker. The key is to determine the amount\nof force needed to either defeat the current attack or deter future attacks. These two\nprinciples define the legal boundaries to self-defense responses.\nA Subset of Self-Defense: Anticipatory Self-Defense\nAnticipatory self-defense is a subset of self-defense and a longstanding tenet of inter-\nnational law. It allows states to defend themselves against imminent armed attacks,\nrather than forcing them to wait until their enemies cross their borders.\nThe legality of anticipatory self-defense rests on the imminency of an attack. Initially,\nimminency restricted anticipatory self-defense to situations immediately before an at-\ntack, where an attack was detected, but there was no time to deliberate about other\nways to prevent the attack short of self-defense. The principle effectively balanced the\nvictim-state’s right to ward off violence against its obligation to find peaceful means to\nresolve disputes. However, due to changes in the nature of warfare, imminency has\nevolved significantly.\nToday, imminency allows states to legally employ force in advance of an attack, at the\npoint when (1) evidence shows that an aggressor has committed itself to an armed\nattack and (2) delaying a response would hinder the defender’s ability to mount a\nmeaningful defense. Thus, imminency is actually a relative concept, which operates as\nfollows:\nWeak States may lawfully act sooner than strong ones in the face of identical threats\nbecause they are at greater risk as time passes. In the same vein, it may be necessary to\nconduct defensive operations against a terrorist group long before a planned attack be-\ncause there is unlikely to be another opportunity to target terrorists before they strike….\nIn other words, each situation presents a case-specific window of opportunity within\nwhich a State can foil an impending attack.‡\nFinally, just because a single attack may be complete does not mean that future attacks\nare not imminent. When evidence suggests that an attack is part of an ongoing cam-\npaign against a state, such as the terrorist attacks against the United States on 9/11,\nfuture armed attacks will be considered imminent and anticipatory self-defense will be\nauthorized.\n‡Schmitt, M. 2003. “Preemptive Strategies in International Law.” Michigan Journal of International\nLaw: 24, 513–34.\nThe Law of War | 51"

As a result, it is important to explore\nthe rights that states have to react to illegal uses of force against them that fall short of\nan armed attack.\nReprisals are an exception to the general rule that states are required to solve their\ndisputes peacefully. Reprisals allow victim-states to take normally unlawful actions\nagainst another state, when the other state is violating its international obligations with\nrespect to the victim-state. Reprisals must comply with three criteria. These are:\n• In the first place [countermeasures] must be taken in response to a previous inter-\nnational wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State.\n• Secondly, the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrong-\nful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it.\n• Third, the effects of a countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury\nsuffered.§\nSince states may not use force contrary to Article 2(4) of the UUN Charter, economic\nand political coercion are the two main forms of reprisals. However, the consensus\namong international scholars is that this really only amounts to a prohibition against\narmed force. Therefore, reprisals could also include the use of limited cyber attacks.\nAlthough this chapter contends that states should deal with cyber attacks using self-\ndefense and anticipatory self-defense legal principles, reprisals provide an important\nalternate theory for dealing with cyber attacks to those who contend that cyber attacks\nfall short of the armed attack threshold.\nThe general framework of jus ad bellum discussed so far has primarily evolved in re-\nsponse to state-on-state attacks. When attacks are carried out by non-state actors across\nstate borders, it complicates the framework governing state responses to the attacks.\nSince most cyber attacks are carried out by non-state actors, this chapter will explore\njus ad bellum in greater depth and explain the intricacies of state responses to attacks\nby non-state actors.\nNon-State Actors and the Law of War\nAs a general rule, international law treats each state as a sovereign and forbids other\nstates from waging war against them or intervening in their domestic affairs.

Consequently, international attacks by non-state actors compli-\ncate the general framework of jus ad bellum.\nAlthough jus ad bellum has always provided some guidance for attacks by non-state\nactors, historically the guidance it provided was scant. However, the rise of transna-\ntional terrorism challenged traditional norms of jus ad bellum and forced states to\nexpand traditional norms to cope with attacks by non-state actors. Today, jus ad bellum\nprovides states with a robust framework for analyzing attacks by non-state actors.\nTo understand whether states can respond to cyber attacks against them with force, an\nanalysis of the underlying law governing attacks by non-state actors must be under-\ntaken. It starts with an analysis of whether armed attacks by non-state actors fall under\nthe law of war, continues with the duties states have to one another concerning non-\nstate actors within their territory, then moves on to ways to impute state responsibility\nfor the acts of non-state actors, and ends with the legality of cross-border operations\nagainst states.\nArmed Attacks by Non-State Actors\nAlthough the issue of armed attacks by non-state actors was not envisioned in the\ndrafting of the UN Charter, customary international law has evolved to allow states to\napply the law of self-defense to attacks by non-state actors. The international com-\nmunity’s response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, (9/11) crystallized the\nvalidity of this principle.\nFollowing the 9/11 attacks, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1368, reaf-\nfirming the United States’ inherent right to engage in self-defense in accordance with\nArticle 51 of the Charter. Two weeks later, when it was clear that Al Qaeda was behind\nthe attacks, the Security Council passed Resolution 1373, once again reaffirming the\nUnited States’ inherent right of self-defense. These resolutions are particularly signifi-\ncant because the 9/11 attacks could have been dealt with under Article 42 of the Char-\nter, but instead were dealt with under Article 51, even though the attacks were com-\nmitted by non-state actors.\nAdditionally, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organization of American\nStates, and Australia all invoked the collective self-defense provisions of their mutual\ndefense treaties to assist the United States in its response to the 9/11 attacks. Finally,\nscores of other states declared their support for the United States to respond in self-\ndefense to Al Qaeda. Given the universal outpouring of support to treat the 9/11 attacks\nas acts of war, it is now incontrovertible that states may apply self-defense law to armed\nattacks by non-state actors.\nHowever, while attacks by non-state actors fall under the law of war, the law of war\nallows states to forcibly respond to these attacks only when the attacks are imputable\nto a state, meaning the state also bears some responsibility for the actions of the non-\nstate actors.

Before 1972, states were generally not viewed\nas legally responsible for the acts of private or non-state actors. Only the actions of a\nhost-state’s organs were imputable to it, and state responsibility arose only from acts\nby qualifying “agents” of the state. Qualified agents amounted to actors over whom a\nstate exercised direct authority, and whom the state directed to conduct the acts. As\ntime passed, international law shifted away from a direct control approach and moved\ntoward an indirect responsibility approach regarding the acts of non-state actors.\nThis shift began with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia’s seminal\nopinion on state responsibility in the Tadic case, in which it revised the direct control\ntest to impute host-state responsibility for the actions of groups of non-state actors over\nwhen a state exercised “overall control” of the group, even though the state may not\nhave directed the particular act in question.† Although overall control is still a form of\ndirect control, the opinion marked a significant relaxation of the standard for state\nresponsibility.\nThe shift to indirect responsibility continued through the middle of 2001, with a general\nconsensus emerging that any breach of a state’s international obligations to other states,\nwhether from treaty law or customary law, and whether the result of a state’s acts or\nits failures to act, resulted in international responsibility for the state.‡ This consensus\nsolidified following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, bringing us to today’s\nframework for state responsibility.\nSeptember 11, 2001, marked the culmination of the shift of state responsibility from\nthe paradigm of direct control to indirect responsibility. On that date, Al Qaeda ter-\nrorists hijacked four airplanes, flew three of them into buildings in the United States,\nand killed more than three thousand U.S. citizens in what was widely recognized as an\narmed attack. Al Qaeda was based in Afghanistan, which at the time was ruled by the\nTaliban. While the Taliban harbored Al Qaeda and occasionally provided it limited\nlogistical support, the Taliban did not exercise effective or even overall control over Al\nQaeda.

As such, there need not be a causal link between a wrongdoer and a state;\nrather, only a failure of a state to uphold its duty to prevent attacks from its territory\ninto another state. “Hence, a state’s passiveness or indifference toward [a non-state\nactor’s] agendas within its own territory might trigger its responsibility, possibly on the\nsame scale as though it had actively participated in the planning.”§ Much of the legal\nanalysis of whether a state is responsible will “turn on an ex-post facto analysis of\nwhether the state could have put more effort into preventing the…attack.”‖\nHowever, even when state responsibility is imputed for the armed attacks of non-state\nactors, states may still be forbidden from responding with force. The final step in the\nlegal analysis ends with the legality of cross-border operations against other states.\nCross-Border Operations\nCross-border operations into the territory of an offending state are the natural conse-\nquence of imputed state responsibility for the armed attacks of non-state actors.\nHowever, states must meet a number of legal requirements before they may pursue a\nnon-state aggressor into another state in self-defense. To understand the rationale be-\nhind why states may breach a host-state’s general right to territorial integrity in self-\ndefense and the requirements states must meet in order to do so, one must first look\nto the UUN Charter’s general prohibition on using force against another state.\nThe right of territorial integrity generally gives way to the right of self-defense. The\nprinciple underlying this balancing act is that when one state violates another state’s\nterritorial integrity, it forfeits its own right to territorial integrity. This principle evolved\nout of state-on-state attacks, but it also may be applied in a similar manner when states\nare indirectly responsible for the violations of another state’s territorial integrity by non-\nstate actors. The key is whether the host-state tried to prevent its territory from being\nused to commit criminal acts against the victim-state.\nAs always, before a state resorts to self-defense, it must ensure that it meets the criteria\nof necessity, proportionality, and, if using the subset of anticipatory self-defense, im-\nminency. Effectively, a state must have no viable alternatives to the use of force, and it\nmust limit its use of force to securing its defensive objectives.\nThe application of these requirements may vary depending on whether the acts of the\nnon-state actors were imputed based on direct control or indirect attribution.

In cases of\nindirect attribution, a victim-state must overcome another hurdle before conducting\ncross-border operations, and ensure that it has properly linked the actions of the non-\nstate actors to the host-state. This may be done by issuing an ultimatum to the sanctuary\nstate to comply with its international obligations or else.\nThe sanctuary state must then either act against the non-state actors, or willingly allow\nthe victim-state to enter its territory and mount operations against the non-state actors.\nOtherwise the victim-state can impute responsibility and conduct its cross-border op-\nerations into the host-state. However, in doing so, the victim-state must limit its targets\nto the non-state actors, unless the host-state uses force to oppose the lawful cross-\nborder operations.\nBased on the foregoing analysis, it is evident that victim-states may forcibly respond to\narmed attacks by non-state actors located in another state when host-states violate their\nduty to prevent those attacks. With cyber attacks, imputing state responsibility in this\nmanner provides states a legal path to utilize active defenses without having to con-\nclusively attribute an attack to a state or its agents. In effect, imputing responsibility is\nthe equivalent of attributing the attack to the state or its agents. Thus, imputing re-\nsponsibility provides states a way around the attribution problem and response crisis.\nHowever, just because there is a legal pathway to get around the requirement that armed\nattacks be attributable to a state or its agents does not mean that cyber attacks by non-\nstate actors lend themselves to this framework. As a result, it is imperative to explain\nwhy cyber attacks constitute armed attacks, what a state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks\nmeans, and the factual circumstances that would allow a victim-state to forcibly re-\nspond to a cyber attack.\nAnalyzing Cyber Attacks Under Jus ad Bellum\nCyber attacks represent a conundrum for legal scholars. Cyber attacks come in many\ndifferent forms, their destructive potential limited only by the creativity and skill of the\nattackers behind them. Although it may seem intuitive that cyber attacks can constitute\narmed attacks, especially in light of their ability to injure or kill, the legal community\nhas been reluctant to adopt this approach because cyber attacks do not resemble tra-\nditional armed attacks with conventional weapons. Further clouding the legal waters\nis the erroneous view of states and scholars alike on the need for states to attribute cyber\nattacks to a state or its agents before responding with force. Although it is true that\ncyber attacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks, and that cyber attacks are\ndifficult to attribute, neither of these characteristics should preclude states from re-\nsponding with force. This section explores different analytical models for assessing\narmed attacks, the logical meaning of the duty of prevention as it relates to cyber at-\ntacks, and the technological capacity of trace programs to trace attacks back to their\npoint of origin.

Ideally, there would be\nclear rules for classifying cyber attacks as armed attacks, imminent armed attacks, or\nlesser uses of force. Unfortunately, since cyber attacks are a relatively new attack form,\ninternational efforts to classify them are still in their infancy, even though the core legal\nprinciples governing armed attacks are well settled. Consequently, whether cyber at-\ntacks can qualify as armed attacks and which cyber attacks should be considered armed\nattacks are left as open questions in international law. To answer these questions, this\nsubsection examines the core legal principles governing armed attacks, applies them\nto cyber attacks, explains why cyber attacks can qualify as armed attacks, and attempts\nto provide some insight into which cyber attacks should be considered armed attacks.\n“Armed attack” is not defined by any international convention. As a result, its meaning\nhas been left open to interpretation by states and scholars. Although this might sound\nproblematic, it is not. The framework for analyzing armed attacks is relatively well-\nsettled, as are the core legal principles governing its meaning. The international\ncommunity generally accepts Jean S. Pictet’s scope, duration, and intensity test as the\nstarting point for evaluating whether a particular use of force constitutes an armed\nattack. Under Pictet’s test, a use of force is an armed attack when it is of sufficient scope,\nduration, and intensity. Of course, as is the case with many international legal concepts,\nstates, non-governmental organizations, and scholars all interpret the scope, duration,\nand intensity test differently.\nState declarations help flesh out which uses of force are of sufficient scope, duration,\nand intensity to constitute an armed attack. Harkening back to the French-language\nversion of the UN Charter, which refers to “armed aggression” rather than an “armed\nattack,” the UN General Assembly passed the Definition of Aggression resolution in\n1974. The resolution requires an attack to be of “sufficient gravity” before it is consid-\nered an armed attack. The resolution never defines armed attacks, but it does provide\nexamples that are widely accepted by the international community. Although the res-\nolution has helped settle the meaning of armed attacks for conventional attacks, the\nmore technology has advanced, the more attacks have come in forms not previously\ncovered by state declarations and practices. Consequently, states recognize that un-\nconventional uses of force may warrant treatment as an armed attack when their scope,\nduration, and intensity are of sufficient gravity. As a result, states are continually mak-\ning proclamations about new methods of warfare, slowly shaping the paradigm for\nclassifying armed attacks.\n58 | Chapter 4: Responding to International Cyber Attacks As Acts of War\nScholars have advanced several analytical models to deal with unconventional attacks,\nsuch as cyber attacks, to help ease attack classification and put the scope, duration,\nand intensity analysis into more concrete terms. These models are especially relevant\nto cyber attacks because they straddle the line between criminal activity and armed\nwarfare. There are three main analytical models for dealing with unconventional at-\ntacks. The first model is an instrument-based approach, which checks to see whether\nthe damage caused by a new attack method previously could have been achieved only\nwith a kinetic attack.# The second is an effects-based approach, sometimes called a\nconsequence-based approach, in which the attack’s similarity to a kinetic attack is ir-\nrelevant and the focus shifts to the overall effect that the cyber attack has on a victim-\nstate.* The third is a strict liability approach, in which cyber attacks against critical\ninfrastructure are automatically treated as armed attacks, due to the severe consequen-\nces that can result from disabling those systems.†\nOf these three approaches, the effects-based approach is the best analytical model for\ndealing with cyber attacks. Not only does effects-based analysis account for everything\nthat an instrument-based approach covers, but it also provides an analytical framework\nfor situations that do not neatly equate to kinetic attacks.‡ Effects-based analysis is also\nsuperior to strict liability because responses to cyber attacks under an effects-based\n#For instance, under an instrument-based approach, a cyber attack used to shut down a power grid is an armed\nattack. This is because shutting down a power grid typically required dropping a bomb on a power station\nor some other kinetic use of force to incapacitate the grid. Since conventional munitions were previously\nrequired to achieve the result, under the instrument-based approach the cyber attack is therefore treated the\nsame way.\n* For instance, under an effects-based approach, a cyber attack that manipulated information across a state’s\nbanking and financial institutions to seriously disrupt commerce in the state is an armed attack. Although\nthe manipulation of information does not resemble a kinetic attack, as required under an instrument-based\napproach, the disruptive effects that the attack had on the state’s economy is a severe enough overall\nconsequence that it warrants treatment as an armed attack.\n†It is important to note that this third analytical model for dealing with cyber attacks is intended to justify\nanticipatory self-defense before any harm actually results. Walter Gary Sharp Sr. proposed this model due to\nthe speed with which a computer penetration can transition into a destructive attack against defense critical\ninfrastructure. His reasoning is that once a penetration has occurred, an imminent threat exists with the\nability to cause harm of extreme scope, duration, and intensity, thereby justifying anticipatory self-defense.\nSee Walter Gary Sharp Sr. 1999. CyberSpace and the Use of Force. Ageis Research Corp. 129–31.\n‡For instance, a cyber attack might shut down a system, rendering it inoperable for some time, or a cyber\nattack might cause an explosion at a chemical plant by tampering with the computers that control the feed\nmixture rates. The results of those attacks mirror the results of conventional armed attacks, previously only\nachievable through kinetic force, thus satisfying the instrument-based approach.\nUnfortunately, cyber attacks can also cause extreme harm that does not mirror the results of conventional\narmed attacks. For instance, coordinated cyber attacks could bring financial markets to their knees without\never employing anything that looked remotely like a kinetic attack, or altered data on a massive scale could\ndisrupt banking, financial transactions, and the general underpinnings of the economy, sowing confusion\nthroughout the victim-state for some time. Under an effects-based approach, the scope, duration, and\nintensity of this attack would equate to an armed attack, despite the fact that it was not previously achievable\nonly through kinetic force.\nAnalyzing Cyber Attacks Under Jus ad Bellum | 59\napproach comport with internationally accepted legal norms and customs, whereas a\nstrict liability approach may cause victim-states to violate the law of war.§\nOf all of the scholars who advocate effects-based models, Michael N. Schmitt has ad-\nvanced the most useful analytical framework for evaluating cyber attacks. In his seminal\narticle “Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law:\nThoughts on a Normative Framework,” Schmitt lays out six criteria for evaluating cyber\nattacks as armed attacks.‖ These criteria are severity, immediacy, directness, invasive-\nness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy. Taken together, they allow states to\nmeasure cyber attacks along several different axes. While no one criterion is dispositive,\ncyber attacks satisfy enough criteria to be characterized as armed attacks. Since their\npublication, Schmitt’s criteria have gained traction in the legal community, with several\nprominent legal scholars advocating for their use. Many hope that Schmitt’s criteria\nwill help bring some uniformity to state efforts to classify cyber attacks. However, until\nSchmitt’s criteria gain wider acceptance, states are likely to classify cyber attacks dif-\nferently, depending on their understanding of armed attacks as well as their conception\nof vital national interest.\nSchmitt’s Six Criteria\nThe meaning of these criteria are as follows:\n1. Severity looks at the scope and intensity of an attack. Analysis under this criterion\nexamines the number of people killed, size of the area attacked, and amount of\nproperty damage done. The greater the damage, the more powerful the argument\nbecomes for treating the cyber attack as an armed attack.\n2. Immediacy looks at the duration of a cyber attack, as well as other timing factors.\nAnalysis under this criterion examines the amount of time the cyber attack lasted\nand the duration of time that the effects were felt. The longer the duration and\neffects of an attack, the stronger the argument that it was an armed attack.\n3. Directness looks at the harm caused. If the attack was the proximate cause of the\nharm, it strengthens the argument that the cyber attack was an armed attack. If\nthe harm was caused in full or in part by other parallel attacks, the weaker the\nargument that the cyber attack was an armed attack.\n4. Invasiveness looks at the locus of the attack. An invasive attack is one that physi-\ncally crosses state borders, or electronically crosses borders and causes harm within\n§The proponents of a strict liability approach advocate automatically responding to cyber attacks on critical\ninfrastructure with active defenses. However, automatically responding to cyber attacks in this manner can\neasily lead a victim-state to counter-attack a state with a long history of doing everything within its power to\nprevent cyber attacks and prosecute its attackers. Were a victim-state to respond with active defenses against\na non-sanctuary state, it would violate jus ad bellum. This is because there is no way to impute state\nresponsibility to such a state, directly or indirectly, even though the cyber attack may constitute an armed\nattack.\n‖Schmitt, M. 1999. “Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a\nNormative Framework.” Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 37: 885, 913–15.\n60 | Chapter 4: Responding to International Cyber Attacks As Acts of War"

Speculative harm generally makes a weak case that a cyber attack\nwas an armed attack.\n6. Presumptive legitimacy focuses on state practice and the accepted norms of be-\nhavior in the international community. Actions may gain legitimacy under the law\nwhen the international community accepts certain behavior as legitimate. The less\na cyber attack looks like accepted state practice, the stronger the argument that it\nis an illegal use of force or an armed attack.\nSee Schmitt, supra note 16, at 913–15; see also Wingfield, T. 2000. The Law of\nInformation Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace. Ageis Research Corp.\n124–27 (examining Schmitt’s use of force analysis).\nClassifying cyber attacks will be difficult for states to do in practice.# Although the\ninitial decision to respond to cyber attacks under the law of war as a matter of policy\nwill have to be made by state policy makers, the actual decision to use active defenses\nwill have to be pushed down to the system administrators who actually operate com-\nputer networks. One of the challenges policy makers will face is translating interna-\ntional law into concise, understandable rules for their system administrators to follow,\nso that a state’s agents comply with international law while protecting its vital computer\nnetworks. However, classifying cyber attacks as armed attacks or imminent armed at-\ntacks is only the first hurdle system administrators must clear before responding with\nactive defenses. The second and equally important hurdle is establishing state respon-\nsibility for the attack.\nEstablishing State Responsibility for Cyber Attacks\nStates cannot respond to a cross-border cyber attack with force without establishing\nstate responsibility for the attack. Although historically this meant that an attack had\nto be attributed to a state or its agents, direct control of an attack is no longer a\n#But there is no doubt that some cyber attacks will qualify as armed attacks, and should be dealt with using\nself-defense and anticipatory self-defense legal principles as a justification for using active defenses.\nSome will undoubtedly critique this conclusion. However, those who argue do miss the way that states have\nclassified unconventional attacks in the past. New attack methods frequently fall outside the accepted\ndefinitions of armed attacks. This does not mean that the attacks are not armed attacks, merely that the\nattacks don’t fit traditional classifications. Furthermore, anyone who argues that cyber attacks cannot rise\nto the level of armed attacks misses an important facet of international law—reprisals, which can be used as\nan alternate basis to authorize active defenses against cyber attacks. This is because at a minimum, cyber\nattacks are an illegal use of force, and their use would then allow states to use another illegal use of force,\nshort of armed force, to deter sanctuary states from allowing attackers to commit them.\nAnalyzing Cyber Attacks Under Jus ad Bellum | 61"

Today, international law bases a state’s responsi-\nbility on its failure to meet its international duties.\nThis shift is especially important for cyber attacks because the prevailing view that states\nmust treat cross-border cyber attacks as a criminal matter, rather than as a national\nsecurity matter, seems to be based on the historic view of state responsibility. This\nlimited view of state responsibility locks states into the response crisis by requiring\nstates to attribute cyber attacks to a state or its agents before responding with active\ndefenses, even though the likelihood of successfully attributing an attack is extremely\nremote. Consequently, states find themselves in the response crisis during a cyber at-\ntack, laboring under the false assumption that they must decide between effective, but\nillegal, active defenses, and the less effective, but legal, path of passive defenses and\ndomestic criminal laws.\nGiven the shift in the law of state responsibility, states should determine whether a\ncyber attack can be imputed to the state of origin rather than trying to conclusively\nattribute it. Once a cyber attack is imputed to a state and that state refuses to return to\ncompliance with its international duties, the legal barriers to acting in self-defense\ndisappear.\nWhile neither state practice nor the publications of legal scholars supports this view\nregarding cyber attacks yet, the accepted principles of customary jus ad bellum support\nimputing state responsibility for armed attacks by non-state actors when the attacks\noriginate from a state that allows non-state actors to conduct criminal operations within\ntheir borders. States that allow non-state actors to conduct those operations breach\ntheir duty to prevent attacks against other states, and are known as sanctuary states.\nThis is extremely important to the victim-states of cyber attacks because when a cyber\nattack originates from a sanctuary state, a victim-state may employ active defenses and\navert the response crisis.\nIt is thus necessary to understand the answers to two key questions:\n• What is a state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks?\n• What must a state do to violate its duty of prevention?\nThe answers are the legal keys that will establish the basis for imputing state respon-\nsibility for cyber attacks and unlock the restraints that states have placed on themselves\nby following the prevailing view of state responsibility for cyber attacks.\nThe Duty to Prevent Cyber Attacks\nStates have an affirmative duty to prevent cyber attacks from their territory against other\nstates. This duty actually encompasses several smaller duties to prevent cyber attacks,\nincluding passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous law enforcement in-\nvestigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, co-\noperating with the victim-states of cyber attacks.

The international community recognizes terrorism\nas a threat to international peace and security, but cannot agree on a definition. As a\nresult, states have adopted the approach of outlawing specific terrorist acts each time\nterrorists adopt new attack methods, rather than outlawing terrorism itself.§ These\ntreaties impose several common requirements on states with regard to terrorist attack\nmethods, such as taking all practicable measures for the purpose of preventing these\nattacks, criminalizing the attacks, submitting cases to competent authorities for pros-\necution, and forcing states to cooperate with each other throughout the criminal pro-\nceedings. Although these treaties do not address cyber attacks, the principles contained\nin them help influence state requirements under customary international law with re-\ngard to terrorism. Since there is growing evidence that cyber attacks will soon be a\nweapon of choice for terrorists, states should refer to the common principles found in\nthese treaties as opinio juris when cyber attacks are used as a terrorist weapon.\nSupport from State Practice\nState treatment of cyber attacks under their criminal laws also evidence recognition of\nthe duty to prevent cyber attacks under customary international law.

After the 9/11 terrorist\nattacks, states across the world condemned terrorism as a threat to international peace\nand security, and provided various forms of support to the United States in its war\nagainst Al Qaeda. Ensuring that terrorism will forever be legally recognized as a threat\nto international peace and security, the Security Council passed Resolution 1373, which\nreaffirmed that acts of international terrorism are threats to international peace and\nsecurity and called on states to work together to prevent and suppress terrorism.

First,\nit shows that states have a duty to prevent threats to international peace and security.\nSecond, it demonstrates that passive acquiescence to threats to international peace and\nsecurity will not be tolerated. Finally, it demonstrates that states must work together\nto prevent and suppress threats to international peace and security.

Most states\nuse causation as a principle for establishing individual responsibility, lending credence\nto the idea that a state’s responsibility also should also be based on causation.\nThus, if a state failed to pass stringent criminal laws, did not investigate international\ncyber attacks, or did not prosecute attackers, it should be held responsible for inter-\nnational cyber attacks against another state because its omission helped create a safe\nhaven for attackers to attack other states.

In Tellini, a special com-\nmittee of jurists held that a state may be held responsible for the criminal acts of non-\nstate actors when it “neglect[s] to take all reasonable measures for the prevention of\nthe crime and pursuit, arrest and bringing to justice of the criminal.”‖ In S.S. Lotus, the\nPermanent Court of International Justice held that “a state is bound to use due diligence\nto prevent the commission within its dominions of criminal acts against another nation\nor its people.”#\nIn Corfu Channel, the International Court of Justice held that states have a duty “not\nto allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other\nstates.”*Although these are older cases, their principles still stand for and support the\nnotion that states have a duty to prevent their territory from being used to commit\ncriminal acts against another state, as well as a duty to pursue, arrest, and bring to\njustice criminals who have conducted cross-border attacks on other states.\nFully Defining a State’s Duty to Prevent Cyber Attacks\nA state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks should not be based on a state’s knowledge of\na particular cyber attack before it occurs, but rather on its actions to prevent cyber\nattacks in general. Cyber attacks are extremely difficult for states to detect prior to the\ncommission of a specific attack, and are often committed by individuals or groups who\nare not even on a state’s radar. However, just because cyber attacks are difficult to\nprevent does not mean that states can breach their duty to prevent them. Stringent\ncriminal laws and vigorous law enforcement will deter cyber attacks. States that do not\nenact such laws fail to live up to their duty to prevent cyber attacks.\nLikewise, even when a state has stringent criminal laws, if it looks the other way when\ncyber attacks are conducted against rival states, it effectively breaches its duty to prevent\nthem through its unwillingness to do anything to stop them, just as if it had approved\nthe attacks. In other words, a state’s passiveness and indifference toward cyber attacks\nmake it a sanctuary state, from where attackers can safely operate. When viewed in this\nlight, it becomes apparent that a state can be held indirectly responsible for cyber at-\ntacks under the established principles of customary international law.\n‖Tellini case, 4 League of Nations O.J. 524 (1924).\n#S.S.

In effect, host-states will be judged\non their efforts to catch and prosecute attackers who have committed cyber attacks,\nwhich is probably the only way that states can deter and prevent future attacks. Since\nvictim-states will end up judging whether a host-state has lived up to its international\nduties, host-states must cooperate with victim-states to ensure transparency. Cooper-\nation will necessarily entail a host-state showing its criminal investigations to a victim-\nstate so that victim-states can correctly judge host-state action.\nFurthermore, when a host-state lacks the technical capacity to track down attackers,\ninternational law should require it to work together with law enforcement officials from\nthe victim-state to jointly track them down.† These two measures will prevent host-\nstates from being perceived as uncooperative and complicit in the use of their networks\nfor attacks against other states. States that deny involvement in a cyber attack but refuse\nto open their investigative records to the victim-state cannot expect to be treated as\nliving up to its international duties. In effect, host-states that refuse to cooperate with\nvictim-states are stating their unwillingness to prevent cyber attacks and have declared\nthemselves as sanctuary states.\nOnce a host-state demonstrates that it is a sanctuary state through its inaction, other\nstates can impute responsibility to it. At that point, the host-state becomes liable for\nthe cyber attack that triggered an initial call for investigation, as well as for all future\ncyber attacks originating from it. This opens the door for a victim-state to use active\ndefenses against the computer servers in that state during a cyber attack.\nThe Choice to Use Active Defenses\nAlthough this chapter urges states to use active defenses to protect their computer\nnetworks, states that choose to use them will find themselves confronted with difficult\nlegal decisions as a result of the limits of technology. Technological limitations will\nplace states in a position where a timely decision to use active defenses requires states\nto decide to use them with imperfect knowledge. Since forcible responses to cyber\nattacks must comply with both principal areas of the law of war—jus ad bellum and\njus in bello—the decision to use active defenses raises several other questions of law\nresulting from these technical limitations. From a practical standpoint, this will affect\nstate decision-making at the highest and lowest levels of government.

Next, it moves on to jus in bello issues.\nJus in bello analysis will begin with the decision to use force, analyzing why active\ndefenses are the most appropriate forceful responses to cyber attacks. Finally, jus in\nbello analysis will conclude with the impact that technological limitations are likely to\nhave on state decisions to use force. Once this is complete, it will be clear that active\ndefenses are a viable way for states to protect themselves, despite the fact that techno-\nlogical limitations will complicate state decision-making.\nTechnological Limitations and Jus ad Bellum Analysis\nWhile cyber attack analysis is greatly simplified by looking at whether a state of origin\nhas violated its duty to prevent, rather than having to attribute an attack, states are still\nlikely to find cyber attacks difficult to deal with in practice. Jus ad bellum requires states\nto carefully analyze a cyber attack and ensure that (1) the attack constitutes an armed\nattack or imminent armed attack; and (2) the attack originates from a sanctuary state.\nBoth of these conditions must exist before a state can lawfully respond with active\ndefenses under jus ad bellum.\nCyber attack analysis will be conducted by system administrators, whose position puts\nthem at the forefront of computer defense. System administrators can use various com-\nputer programs to facilitate their analysis. Automated detection and warning programs\ncan help detect intrusions, classify attacks, and flag intrusions for administrator action.\nAutomated or administrator-operated trace programs can trace attacks back to their\npoint of origin. These programs can help system administrators classify cyber attacks\nas armed attacks or lesser uses of force and evaluate whether attacks originate from a\nstate previously declared a sanctuary state. When attacks meet the appropriate legal\nthresholds, system administrators may use active defenses to protect their networks.\nUnfortunately, technological limitations on attack detection, attack classification, and\nattack traces are likely to further complicate state decision-making during cyber attack\nanalysis. Ideally, attacks would be easy to detect, classify, and trace. Unfortunately,\nthis is not the case. This section analyzes the technological limits of these programs and\nexplores their likely impact on state decision makers and system administrators.\nLimitations on attack detection\nEarly detection and warning programs can help catch cyber attacks before they reach\ntheir culminating point, but even the best programs are unable to detect all cyber at-\ntacks. As a result, cyber attacks are bound to harm states.

The longer it takes to detect an attack, the less\ncompelling the need for states to use active defenses, especially when the attack seems\ntruly complete. On the other hand, when an attack that has reached completion is seen\nas part of a series of ongoing attacks, the need to use active defenses to deter future\nattacks is more compelling.\nLimitations on attack classification\nEarly detection and warning programs will detect many cyber attacks mid-attack.\nHowever, detecting an attack before its culmination makes it harder to classify. Natu-\nrally, a system administrator will immediately attempt to shut down a cyber attack with\npassive defenses as soon as it is detected, but that is not the full extent of his job. The\nsystem administrator must also assess the damage that has been done, as well as any\nlikely future damage, so that an informed decision can be made about whether to use\nactive defenses.‡\nWhen an ongoing cyber attack has already caused severe, immediate, invasive, direct,\nand measurable damage, it can safely be classified as an armed attack, even though it\nis still ongoing. On the other hand, when an attack has not caused such damage, a\nsystem administrator will need to look at (1) the immediacy of future harm and (2) the\nlikelihood of fending off the attack with purely defensive measures to determine\nwhether the attack should be classified as an imminent armed attack. Given the light-\nning speeds with which computer codes can execute, this will be very difficult to do,\nas delaying the use of active defenses increases the likelihood of harm to a state.\nThe limitations on attack classification should give system administrators pause before\ndeciding to use active defenses in anticipatory self-defense. While it is lawful to make\na decision based on their best analysis of the facts, such determinations will be highly\nspeculative due to the shadowy nature of cyber attacks. Most likely, when a computer\nintrusion is detected, the purpose of the attack will be difficult to discern without dis-\nsecting a program’s code or reviewing the audit logs of an attacker’s activity. Further-\nmore, the speed with which cyber attacks execute will force system administrators to\nmake their best guess, even though they will probably be missing critical information.\nGiven the speculative nature of any such calculus, state policy makers may want to\ndirect their system administrators to respond to cyber attacks in anticipatory self-\ndefense only as an act of last resort, to prevent an escalation of hostilities between states.\n‡These decisions will, no doubt, be based on guidelines promulgated by the victim-state before the attack ever\noccurs. These rules would simplify the legal framework into a set of rules more easily understood by the\nlayperson, similar to the rules of engagement that military personnel follow.\n70 | Chapter 4: Responding to International Cyber Attacks As Acts of War"

    "output": "Limitations on attack traces\nCyber attacks are frequently conducted through intermediate computer systems to\ndisguise the true identity of the attacker. Although trace programs are capable of pen-\netrating intermediate disguises back to their electronic source, their success rate is not\nperfect. Thus, trace programs run the risk of incorrectly identifying the true source of\nan attack. This creates an apparent problem because an attack could be incorrectly\nperceived as coming from a state that is not the actual state of origin. However, this is\nnot as big a problem as it appears. State responsibility should still be judged on the\nfacts at hand, even if it results in misattribution. First, as long as a state assesses an\nattack to the best of its technical capability and acts in good faith on the information\non hand, it has met its international obligations. Second, states that refuse to comply\nwith their international duty to prevent their territory from being used to commit cyber\nattacks have chosen to risk being held indirectly responsible by accident. After all, a\nstate can avoid being the target of active defenses, even when attacks originate from it,\nby taking affirmative steps to prevent cyber attacks, such as enacting stringent criminal\nlaws, enforcing those laws, and cooperating with victim-states to bring attackers to\njustice.\nJus in Bello Issues Related to the Use of Active Defenses\nDecisions to use force are governed by jus in bello. Jus in bello stands for the proposition\nthat states do not have a right to use unlimited force against other states during war.§\nAt its core, jus in bello uses four basic principles to regulate the conduct of states during\nwarfare. These are: distinction, necessity, humanity, and proportionality.\nThe Four Principles of Jus in Bello\nDistinction is the requirement that “[p]arties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish\nbetween the civilian population and combatants and…shall direct their operations only\nagainst military objectives.” Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 Au-\ngust 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts,\nJune 8, 1977, 1125 UNT.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I]. However, distinction\ndoes not protect civilians who directly participate in hostilities. Id., art. 51(3).\nNecessity limits the amount of force a state can use against legitimate targets to the\namount “necessary to accomplish a valid military objective,” and forbids using force\npurely for the sake of causing “unnecessary human misery and physical destruction.”\nU.S. Dep’t of Navy, NWP 1–14M, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval\nOperations § 5.3.1 (2007).\n§This proposition is derived from Hague Convention IV, Annex, Article 22, which states “[t]he right of\nbelligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.” Hague Convention IV Respecting the\nLaws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex (Regulations), Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, 1 Bevans 631\n[hereinafter Hague IV].\nThe Choice to Use Active Defenses | 71"

    "output": "Humanity prohibits the use of weapons designed “to cause unnecessary suffering.”\nHague IV, supra note 34.\nProportionality protects civilians and their property the same way necessity and hu-\nmanity protect lawful targets from excessive uses of force. Understanding that attacks\non legitimate targets will often cause incidental damage beyond the lawful target itself,\nproportionality limits the use of force to situations in which the expected military ad-\nvantage outweighs the expected collateral damage to civilians and their property. This\nprinciple is derived from Additional Protocol I, Article 51(5)(b), which states that it is\nprohibited to use force that “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life,\ninjury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would\nbe excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.” Ad-\nditional Protocol I, supra note 35.\nActive defenses: The most appropriate forceful response\nAlthough this chapter advocates the use of active defenses in response to cyber attacks,\nonce one accepts that states are legally authorized to respond to cyber attacks with\nforce, the necessary consequence is that states may use force to the extent authorized\nunder jus in bello. In other words, unless jus in bello stops states from using conven-\ntional weapons, forcible responses are not limited to active defenses. Therefore, it is\nworth explaining why policy makers should choose to use active defenses as the most\nappropriate response to cyber attacks.\nActive defenses are the most appropriate type of force to use against cyber attacks in\nlight of the principles of jus in bello. First, in terms of military necessity, active defenses\nprobably represent all the force needed to accomplish the mission of defending against\na cyber attack. Active defenses can trace an attack back to its source and immediately\ndisrupt it, whereas kinetic weapons will be slower and less effective than the lightning\nspeed of a hack-back. Therefore, employing kinetic weapons over active defenses will\nnot only be less effective, but will also violate the principle of necessity by employing\nforce purely for destruction’s sake. Second, in terms of proportionality, active defenses\nare less likely to cause disproportionate collateral damage than kinetic weapons. The\ntraceback capabilities of active defenses allow them to target only the source of a cyber\nattack. Although collateral damage may still result because the originating computer\nsystem may serve multiple functions, unless an attacker uses critical information sys-\ntems to conduct the attack, damage should be fairly limited from the use of active\ndefenses.\nFurthermore, since the majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it\nseems unlikely that many attacks will be launched from the computers that serve as\ncomponents of a state’s critical infrastructure. Thus, active defenses provide states a\nway to surgically strike at their attacker with minimal risks of severe collateral damage\nto the host-state, thereby meeting the proportional requirement to select the weapon\nleast likely to cause excessive collateral damage or incidental injury.\n72 | Chapter 4: Responding to International Cyber Attacks As Acts of War"

Technological limitations may prevent states from conducting\nthe surgical strikes envisioned with active defenses. The more an attacker routes his\nattack through intermediary systems, the more difficult it is to trace.\nFurthermore, complex traces take time, which is not always available during a moment\nof crisis. Adding to these difficulties, trace programs often have problems pinpointing\nthe source of an attack once an attacker terminates his electronic connection. Some-\ntimes these difficulties will simply result in a failure to identify the source of an attack;\nother times it may result in the incorrect identification of an intermediary system as the\nsource of an attack. Even when the source of an attack is correctly identified, the victim-\nstate’s system administrator must map out the attacking computer system to distin-\nguish its functions and the likely consequences that will result from shutting it down.\nHowever, system mapping takes time, often more time than a state has to make an\ninformed decision. Sometimes an administrator will be able to map a system quickly,\nallowing states to make informed decisions about likely collateral damage. But other\ntimes a state will be forced to predict the likely consequences of using active defenses\nwithout having fully mapped a system. As a result, any state that employs active de-\nfenses runs the risk of accidentally targeting innocent systems and causing unintended,\nexcessive collateral damage.\nTo ensure the lawful use of active defenses in accordance with the principles of dis-\ntinction and proportionality, states must try to mitigate these risks. In the realm of\nactive defenses, this means doing everything feasible to identify (1) the computer system\nthat launched the initial attack and (2) the probable collateral damage that will result\nfrom using active defenses against that system. Once a state does everything feasible to\nensure it has the right information and acts in good faith in accordance with jus in bello,\nit is legally protected from erroneous calculations, even when it targets civilian systems\nor causes excessive collateral damage in relation to its military objective. Thus, states\nmay still act with imperfect information, based on the way facts appear at the time,\nwhen the potential danger forces them to act. The real test will be whether danger to\nthe victim-state’s systems justified the use of active defenses in light of the likely col-\nlateral damage to the host-state.\nAlthough an in-depth discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter, there are several\nissues worthy of consideration before a state decides to implement active defenses.\nFirst, due to the compressed timelines of cyber attacks, a state may need to automate\nits active defenses so that it can respond in a timely manner.

As a result, defenses should probably be automated only for detection\npurposes, requiring human analysis and approval before actually counter-striking.\nSecond, just because it is legal to use active defenses under the circumstances described\nhere, that does not mean it is sound policy. States must decide whether the diplomatic\nfallout is worth the risk. Unfortunately, technological limitations can cause state cal-\nculations to be erroneous at times and civilian systems to be targeted or excessively\ndamaged. States must decide that the second-guessing that other states will engage in\nis worth the benefit gained from protecting their computer systems.\nThird, there is the chance that the servers from which the initial attacks originate are\nintimately tied to important systems in the host-state, and if turned off could have\ndevastating effects and cause unnecessary suffering. This possibility must be factored\ninto the state’s evaluation of military necessity versus probable collateral damage, es-\npecially if a state responds with active defenses without fully mapping an attacking\nsystem.\nFourth, states should carefully design their active defenses. Poorly coded active defense\nprograms run the risk of self-propagating in cyberspace beyond their initial purpose,\nand can run the risk of evolving from a defensive program into a computer virus or\nworm whose damage goes far beyond its intended design. Since active defenses repre-\nsent a new frontier in cyber warfare, their initial use will be controversial, no matter\nthe situation. States should expect public scrutiny and diplomatic protests until such\ntime as active defenses are recognized as a lawful method of self-defense under inter-\nnational law.\nConclusion\nCyber attacks are one of the greatest threats to international peace and security in the\n21st century. Securing cyberspace is an absolute imperative. In an ideal world, states\nwould work together to eliminate the cyber threat. Unfortunately, our world is no\nutopia, nor is it likely to become one. Global cooperation may be a reality one day, but\nunless something changes to pressure sanctuary states into changing their behavior,\nthere is no impetus for them to do so.\nThe way to achieve this reality is to use active defenses against cyber attacks originating\nfrom sanctuary states. Not only will this allow victim-states to better protect themselves\nfrom cyber attacks, but it should also deter aggression and push sanctuary states into\ntaking their international duty seriously. After all, no state wants another state using\nforce within its borders, even electronically. Thus, the possibility that cyber attacks will\nbe met with a forceful response is the hammer that can drive some sense into sanctuary\nstates.\n74 | Chapter 4: Responding to International Cyber Attacks As Acts of War\nSince states do not currently use active defenses, any decision to use them will be a\ncontroversial change to state practice. Like any proposal that changes the way states\ndo business, it is bound to be met with criticism on a number of fronts. However, there\nis sound legal authority to use active defenses against states that violate their duty to\nprevent cyber attacks. States that violate this duty and refuse to change their practices\nshould be held responsible for all further attacks originating from within their borders\nin accordance with the law of war. At a time when cyber attacks threaten global security\nand states are scrambling to find ways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason\nto shield sanctuary states from the lawful use of active defenses by victim-states, and\nevery reason to enhance state defenses to cyber attacks by using them.\nConclusion | 75"

Figure 5-1\nshows a breakdown of what was known about the attacks after BKIS gained control of\ntwo of the command and control (C&C) servers.\nThanks to information shared between KR CERT and AP CERT (of which BKIS is a\nmember), BKIS researchers were able to gain access to two of the C&C servers and\ndetermined that the botnet was controlled by a total of eight C&C servers. The zombie\nPCs in this botnet were instructed to log onto a different, randomly chosen server every\nthree minutes.\nMore importantly, the researchers discovered the existence of a yet another server,\nlocated in the UK, which acted as a master server by controlling the eight C&C servers.\nThis prompted BKIS to name the UK as the source of the attacks.\nIf the South Korean government (ROK) had wished to retaliate against the botnet au-\nthors, and failing that, against the government of the country from which the attack\noriginated, it would have found itself in a very awkward position indeed.

It was in Miami, Florida, on a server that belonged to Global\nDigital’s partner, Digital Latin America (DLA).\nThe DLA Miami office connects with Global Digital’s Brighton office by way of a virtual\nprivate network (VPN), which made it appear as though the master server was in Britain\ninstead of in the U.S. An official statement from DLA said that viruses were found on\nthe Miami server, but details on what kind of viruses were not forthcoming.\nSo once again, as was seen in the case of the StopGeorgia.ru forum, a key component\nof a malicious attack was hosted not inside the borders of a known adversary but within\nthe United States itself.\nThis phenomenon has not been adequately addressed or even considered in any of the\nlegal arguments that I have read that make the case for a preemptive first strike or even\na nuclear deterrent against the initiators of a cyber attack.\nAs you’ll learn more about in Chapter 8, in 2008, 75% of the C&C servers controlling\nthe world’s largest botnets were hosted by a company in Northern California, which\n78 | Chapter 5: The Intelligence Component to Cyber Warfare\nFigure 5-1.

This is just one example of how\ncyberspace is radically changing the threat environment into one never before seen by\nsenior military leadership in any nation.\nBKIS concluded its report with an assessment of the size of the botnet., which was far\nlarger than any other estimate issued since the attack began. Symantec estimated 50,000\nbots, and the ROK government estimated 20,000. However, BKIS used its own formula\nand determined that this botnet consisted of 166,908 bots scattered across 74 different\ncountries. The top 10 countries involved were, in order, the ROK, U.S., China, Japan,\nCanada, Australia, Phillipines, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.\nThe Botnet Versus the Malware\nWhereas the botnet showed a relatively high degree of sophistication, the malware was\namateurish in comparison:\n• It was based on the code base of a very old virus—MyDoom.\n• It appeared to be a patchwork of scripts rather than any custom coding, so it was\nmost likey done by someone who is not a coder.\n• There was no attempt made to avoid AV signatures.\n• There is some evidence that either it was written to target Korean-language systems\nor the author used a Korean-language email template.\nThere was a lot of discussion within the PGG network about possible culprits, but a\nconsensus was never reached. One thing that most investigators agreed on, however,\nwas that the person who created the botnet was not the same person who cobbled\ntogether the virus.\nAnother hypothesis was the possible involvement of organized crime, at least on the\nbotnet side. That theory fell out of favor once it was revealed that the botnet contained\na self-destruct feature, suggesting it might have been specifically set up to perform only\nthis task or modified after it was acquired.\nPGG investigators also explored the possibility that the botnet was acquired by a state\nfrom members of organized crime in an exchange for favors. This would protect the\nstate by maintaining plausible deniability and misdirection.\nIn this scenario, the state brings in its own technologists to make some modifications\nand deliver the payload, which was purposefully cobbled together from a five-year-old\nvirus to propel the misdirection strategy even further.\nHow many states have the technical know-how and strategic connections with organ-\nized crime to pull this off? Probably all of the usual suspects. Possible motivations,\nhowever, are not clear.\nIn my opinion, the most likely scenario is a non-state Korean hacker living in China or\nJapan who saw an opportunity to embarrass the U.S. and South Korea and took it.\n80 | Chapter 5: The Intelligence Component to Cyber Warfare"

    "output": "I expanded the investigation from the purely technical aspects to include a geopolitical\ncomponent and that is how I made the conclusion I did. That meant looking into the\ncyber warfare capabilities of the ROK’s popular choice for a villain—the Democratic\nPeople’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korean.\nThe DPRK’s Capabilities in Cyberspace\nNorth Korea is an interesting dichotomy. It is a society on the edge of disintegrating\ndue to intense poverty, almost no infrastructure, a weak power grid, and a lack of\nnatural resources. Forget about Internet access anywhere but within the DPRK military.\nThat’s because it spends almost of all its money on its military, particularly on training\nits highly educated young people in one of seven research labs, according to a paper\nauthored by Christopher Brown while at the Naval Postgraduate School in September\n2004, titled “Developing a Reliable methodology for Assessing the Computer Network\nOperations Threat of North Korea.”\nThe top three labs in 2004, as described by Brown, were:\nPyongyang Informatics Center (PIC)\n“Today PIC employs over 200 qualified software engineers, whose average age is\n28, with 1.5 computers per person (according to Chan-Mo Park’s article ‘Current\nStatus of Software Development in DPRK and Collaboration between the South\nand North,’ August 2001). The PIC primarily focuses on software development\nand is responsible for the development of the General Korean Electronic Publica-\ntion Systems, 3D CAD, embedded Linux software, web applications, interactive\nprograms, accounting software, and more recently virtual reality software. It is\nreported that the PIC is also responsible for developing the filters to be used be-\ntween the Kwang Myong Intranet and the Internet.”\nKorea Computer Center (KCC)\n“The KCC was established in 1990 by Kim Il Sung to promote computerization in\nthe DPRK. At its inception, the KCC employed approximately 800 employees\nwhose average age was 26. Today Kim Jong Il’s son, Kim Jong Nam—who also\nheads North Korea’s intelligence service, the State Security Agency (SSA)—heads\nthe KCC. He is also the chairman of North Korea’s Computer Committee. In May\n2001, the South Korean newspaper the Chosun Ilbo reported that Kim Jong Nam\nhad moved the SSA’s overseas intelligence gathering unit, which operates primarily\nby hacking and monitoring foreign communications, into the KCC building. In\n2001, the South Korean media reported that the KCC was nothing less than the\ncommand center for Pyongyang’s cyber warfare industry, masquerading as an in-\nnocuous, computer-geek-filled software research facility.”\nSilver Star Laboratories (Unbyol)\n“Silver Star Laboratories (SSL) was established in 1995 under the Korean Unbyol\nGeneral Trading Corporation. According to Kang Yong Jun, the director of SSL,\nthe average age of the researchers at SSL is 26 years, with most graduating from\nThe Korean DDoS Attacks (July 2009) | 81\nKim Il Sung University and other distinguished universities across the country.\nProspective employees are usually graduates of the Pyongyang Senior Middle\nSchool No.1, a genius-training center.\n“SSL has developed such programs as Silver Mirror, a remote control program,\ncommunications, and artificial intelligence software. SSL also produces several\nlanguage recognition programs and multimedia software, in addition to taking\nspecial orders from foreign companies (Korean Central News Agency, ‘Silver Star\nLaboratories of Korea,’ http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1998/9809/news09/23.htm,\nSeptember 1998). SSL won at the fourth and fifth annual FOST Cup World Com-\nputer Go Championship competitions, held in 1998 and 1999, respectively.”\nIn other words, North Korea doesn’t have the infrastructure to sustain a civilian hacker\npopulation. All of its money and all of its talent (meaning young people who show the\nrequisite abilities) are part of its military establishment.\nThe payload portion of this botnet woudn’t have passed muster at any of the official\nIT research facilities associated with the DPRK. These are well-educated individuals,\nsome having attended the Indian Institute of Technology (one of the world’s top tech-\nnology schools), and the quality of their work is high.\nA Korean hacker who wasn’t part of the DPRK military wouldn’t have the resources\ninside the DPRK to run this attack. More likely, either he is a DPRK-approved student\nat an Indian, Chinese, or Japanese university, or he is living in another country as an\nillegal.\nAnother alternative would be a Russian or Chinese hacker who simply wanted to set\nup a scenario that would embarrass the U.S. and throw suspicion onto a likely fall guy—\nthe DPRK.\nWhat were the consequences of this attack? It showed how vulnerable certain govern-\nment websites still are, both in the U.S. and South Korea.\nU.S. sites that went down during the Independence Day weekend attack included the\nDepartment of Transportation, the Secret Service, and the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe State Department website was attacked and experienced degraded service. The\nWhite House and Department of Defense sites were also attacked, but experienced no\nnegative impact.\nClearly more work needs to be done by the National Security Agency (NSA), which has\nbeen tasked to protect U.S. government websites under the new distribution of re-\nsponsibilities between the NSA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),\nwhich will focus on the protection of our civilian networks.\nAnother consequence was the response from Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), former chair\nof the House Intelligence Committee and now senior Republican member, who called\nfor the U.S. military to attack North Korea. Wired magazine reported the story on July\n10, 2008:\n82 | Chapter 5: The Intelligence Component to Cyber Warfare"

Or they will try to, and they may miscalculate, and people could be\nkilled.\nHe also claimed that multiple experts who had been investigating the attack said that\n“most likely all the fingers” point to the North Koreans and this was a “state act” and\nnot that of “some amateurs.”\nOf course, none of that is true. Why Hoekstra would make such claims is impossible\nto say, but it was reminiscent of other politically charged claims of imaginary threats\ncoinciding with misstatements of intelligence findings and facts in evidence.\nOne Year After the RU-GE War, Social Networking Sites Fall to\nDDoS Attack\nOn August 6, 2009, close to the one-year anniversary of the August 8 invasion of Geor-\ngia by Russian troops, the Georgian blogger known as Cyxymu became the focal point\nof a series of DDoS attacks that would end up taking Twitter offline and severely ham-\npering Facebook and LiveJournal access, inconveniencing millions of users.\nFrom the beginning, this seemed like overkill on the part of those launching the DDoS\nattacks. Then, as information began to come in regarding the small size of the botnets\nused, it became clear that Twitter’s fragile infrastructure was also to blame.\nTwitter has had bandwidth problems since its inception. Facebook has similar troubles,\nand LiveJournal has been operating with a skeleton staff ever since SUP acquired it\nfrom Six Apart in 2008. In other words, it didn’t take too much to force the networks\nof these very popular services offline.\nThe DDoS attack consisted of a combination of email spam, a TCP-Syn attack, and a\nHTTP-query DDoS attack:\n• The email spam (called a “joe-job”) was sent by a 300-node botnet normally af-\nfiliated with sending out online casino spam.\n• The TCP-Syn attack was sent by a 3,000-node botnet. This type of attack interrupts\nthe three-way handshake that must occur for packets to travel from an origination\npoint to a destination point. Since the handshake never completes, the connection\nqueue fills up and denies other users access to services.\n• An HTTP-query DDoS eats up a server’s resources by sending more hits than it\ncan process to its website.\nOne Year After the RU-GE War, Social Networking Sites Fall to DDoS Attack | 83\nThe frailties of the networks involved didn’t factor into Cyxymu’s thinking on the\nsubject. Cyxymu, a Georgian professor who blogs in Russian, is convinced that the\nimpact of the attacks (knocking three large services offline) is evidence that the Russian\ngovernment is behind it. According to an article in the Guardian on August 7, 2009,\nCyxymu told the reporter:\n“Maybe it was carried out by ordinary hackers but I’m certain the order came from the\nRussian government,” said the blogger, whose monicker is a Latin version of the Russian\nspelling of Sukhumi, the capital of Georgia’s other breakaway republic, Abkhazia.\n“An attack on such a scale that affected three worldwide services with numerous servers\ncould only be organised by someone with huge resources.”\nTo date, none of the individuals responsible has been identified, but there remains a\ngreat deal of animosity between the two countries.\nThere was a definite lack of chatter on Russian hacker forums about this incident—\nwhich is quite different from the Russia-Georgia cyber war of 2008—implying that this\nwas more likely to be a locally contained feud orchestrated by a small group of indi-\nviduals rather than the rallying call to cyber arms that was seen previously.\nThe lack of chatter and the virulent animosity that such an attack demonstrated led\nProject Grey Goose investigators to look at the possible involvement of Russian youth\nassociations, which have been linked to the Estonia and Georgia attacks, as well as\nattacks against anti-Kremlin websites, organizations, and individuals.\nPGG research revealed that Georgia is still a highly volatile issue among some Nashi\nmembers. Eurasia.net reported that a motorcade of five vehicles containing approxi-\nmately 20 Nashi members were stopped by Georgian authorities as they attempted to\ncross into the country on April 15, 2009. Nashi “commissar” Aleksandr Kuznetsov was\ndetained and questioned about the group’s plans. Kuznetsov produced a letter from\nVasili Yakemenko, head of Russia’s Committee for Youth Affairs, which endorsed the\nmotorcade’s mission and asked Russian officials who came into contact with Kuznetsov\nto assist him. Yakemenko is a former Nashi leader and the creator of another Russian\nyouth group, Walking Together, established in May 2000.\nThis incident on the Georgian border was preceded by a Nashi-organized protest at the\nGeorgian embassy in Moscow on April 9, 2009, the day before the motorcade left\nMoscow for Tbilisi. In addition, according to Georgian authorities who interviewed\nKuznetsov, some of the 20 Nashi members were armed with weapons and were pre-\npared to engage Georgian authorities on the border if prevented from reaching their\ndestination.\nThe animosity against Georgian blogger Cyxymu is longstanding, with the first DDoS\nattack occurring in October 2008, which also knocked LiveJournal offline. The fact\nthat he has a wide readership and blogs in Russian makes him a popular target for anti-\nGeorgian factions within Russia.\n84 | Chapter 5: The Intelligence Component to Cyber Warfare"

Investigators concluded that this was a likely\nNashi-orchestrated action against a highly visible and controversial blogger, symbol-\nizing their anti-Georgian position on the anniversary of the Russia-Georgia war. The\nfact that it brought down two social networks in the process was more a reflection of\nTwitter and LiveJournal’s fragile architecture than the power of the attack.\nIngushetia Conflict, August 2009\nIngushetia is one of the poorest, most corrupt, and violent of the Russian Federation’s\noutlying states. It neighbors Chechnya and, in recent months, has outdone its neighbor\nin terms of random killings and escalating levels of violence and desperation.\nThe latest conflict involves Jihadist radical groups attempting to unseat the military\nleadership. The principal religion in the North Caucasus region is Islam, and young\npeople in particular are becoming radicalized in the face of an oppressive and corrupt\ngoverning regime.\nOne of the loudest voices of the opposition movement is a website—Ingushetia.org,\nformerly Ingushetia.ru. One year ago, the owner of that website, Magomed Yevloyev,\nwas arrested by police, ostensibly to answer some questions as part of an investigation.\nOn the way to police headquarters, while seated in the back of a police car, Yevloyev\nwas “accidentally” shot in the temple, according to the Interior Ministry of Ingushetia.\nThe Ingushetia.org website has experienced hacker attacks off and on since 2007, usu-\nally timed to its more controversial pronouncements, such as the “I have not voted”\ncampaign launched during the 2007 Russian elections.\nIn July and August of 2009, DDoS attacks were launched against this website, coin-\nciding with increasing tensions between the government and the opposition. On August\n17, 2009, a suicide bomber driving a truck packed with explosives blew himself up near\nthe Ingushetia police station, leaving 20 dead and 130 injured.\nNot surprisingly, at least one C&C server involved in the DDoS attacks against\nIngushetia.org is hosted on an IP address that is affiliated with Russian organized crime\n(the Russian Business Network, or RBN).\nRussian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov wrote about suspected Federal Secur-\nity Service (FSB) involvement in cyber attacks in the region dating back to 2002 in an\narticle that was published in Novaya Gazeta on May 31, 2007.

Attack orders are passed down through political channels to Russian youth or-\nganizations whose members initiate the attack, which gains further momentum\nthrough crowd-sourcing.\n3. Russian organized crime provides its international platform of servers from which\nthese attacks are launched, which in some cases are servers hosted by badware\nproviders in the U.S.\nThe Predictive Role of Intelligence\nThe core responsibility of intelligence as a discipline is to provide state leadership with\ninsight into what the emerging threats are before they manifest into an attack on the\nstate.\nThis was already a difficult task when the only threats were physical. Today, intelligence\nagencies must also consider emerging threats in an entirely new dimension—\ncyberspace. To make it even more difficult, the generation of experts currently per-\nforming this mission are still trying to understand just what a threat in cyberspace looks\nlike, or, even worse, what cyberspace is.\nOne approach—further addressed in Chapter 12—is to build a predictive model that\ndepicts how most politically motivated cyber attacks develop.\nAnother is to mine the various forums, websites, chat rooms, and other channels where\nthe cyber underground conducts its business. This is often a hit-and-miss proposition\nbecause the more experienced crews are aware that forums are being watched and use\nIRC chat or other more secure methods of communication. Sometimes, however, mis-\ntakes happen and astute intelligence-gathering operations can capitalize on those\nsources.\nHowever, these are passive approaches to intelligence collection and analysis, and are\nnot nearly sufficient to meet the IC’s responsibility to identify emerging threats before\nthey occur.\nWhat is needed in cyberspace is the same time-tested approach that has been used by\nspies since before Sun Tzu was a general. Sun Tzu’s advice still applies today (from\nChapter 13 of The Art of War, “The Use of Spies”):\nHostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in\na single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy’s condition simply be-\ncause one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments,\nis the height of inhumanity.\nOne who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of\nvictory.\nThus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and\nachieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.\n86 | Chapter 5: The Intelligence Component to Cyber Warfare\nNow this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively\nfrom experience nor by any deductive calculation.\nKnowledge of the enemy’s dispositions can only be obtained from other men. Hence the\nuse of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted\nspies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies.\nWhen these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This\nis called “divine manipulation of the threads.” It is the sovereign’s most precious faculty.\nAn effective cyber intelligence operation must include the use of espionage and covert\nsurveillance inside the hacker criminal underground as well as nationalistic youth or-\nganizations. This is a very broad arena that allows for any number of imaginative ap-\nproaches, but one thing that is critical, and is a major stumbling block to many U.S.\nagencies, is the employment of U.S. citizens of foreign birth in the nations that are\ngenerally considered adversarial (e.g., the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic\nof China). The irony of the federal bureaucracy is that it keeps out the very people upon\nwhom our national security may depend. A 29-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who\nlived his entire life in Russia, was educated in the best Russian institutions, and has\nnow adopted the U.S. as his home will almost never receive the security clearance that\nhe needs to do the work for which his experience has perfectly prepared him.\nThis is one of the areas, however, that creates opportunities for GreyLogic’s Project\nGrey Goose and other investigative international security trust networks (STNs). PGG\nis not bound by the same bureaucratic shackles or legal authorities that employees and\ncontractors of the intelligence community are. Volunteers are vetted not by their ability\nto receive a Top Secret/SCI with Full Scope Polygraph clearance; they are vetted by\ntheir peers who know and trust them and by the quality of the work they produce,\nwhich often speaks for itself.\nI have had the opportunity to broach this subject many times during briefings that I\nprovided to various agencies within the IC. Since these were unclassified briefings based\non open source intelligence (OSINT), the moment I would broach the subject of con-\nducting this type of covert campaign, the conversation ended. I was told that that was\nout of their domain. Astoundingly, the very sources and methods upon which a suc-\ncessful cyber intelligence operation depends is outside the domain of the very federal\nemployees tasked with the mission of open source cyber intelligence gathering.\nAn experienced military officer who has spent the bulk of his career working in Com-\nputer Network Operations and with whom I have had frequent discussions pointed\nout that the DoD employees tasked with open source work could not comment or\ndiscuss a covert action simply because covert actions are, by definition, not open source.\nThe open source intelligence model as used by Project Grey Goose investigators is not\na passive one that simply gathers publicly available data for analysis. Instead, the model\nuses active discovery that pushes the envelope but never crosses into illegal activities.\nThe Predictive Role of Intelligence | 87\nAlthough progress is being made inside the U.S. intelligence community, this distinc-\ntion between active and passive collection, as well as legacy constraints on OSINT\nanalysts, is a contributing factor in why the United States government finds itself con-\nstantly on the defensive in cyberspace and vulnerable to whomever wants to attack its\nnetworks and access its critical infrastructure.\n88 | Chapter 5: The Intelligence Component to Cyber Warfare"

(Twitter is a\npopular microblogging service.) Screenshots of a few of them were posted as proof on\na forum at zataz.com, a French website.\nThis was the second time in 2009 that Twitter had a breach in its security (the first\nbeing in January by a hacker named GMZ), and also for the second time, Twitter CEO\nEvan Williams announced that a “thorough, independent security audit of all internal\nsystems and implementing additional anti-intrusion measures to further safeguard user\ndata” would be done.\nWilliams also claimed, much to Croll’s chagrin, that no important files were accessed,\nnor was anything taken.\nDeciding to teach Twitter a lesson and provide a warning to corporations everywhere,\nCroll sent a zipped file of over 300 Twitter documents, including financial statements\nand executive memos and meeting notes, to TechCrunch, a popular and influential IT\nwebsite owned by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Michael Arrington.\nTechCrunch created a firestorm of controversy on July 16, 2009, when it published a\nnumber of the stolen documents on its website\nTechCrunch followed that up with a detailed accounting of exactly how Hacker Croll\naccomplished his break-in. He didn’t use any hacking tools, Croll told reporter Robert\nMcMillan for a May 1, 2009 article for IDG News:\n“One of the admins has a Yahoo! account, I’ve reset the password by answering to the\nsecret question. Then, in the mailbox, I have found her [sic] twitter password,” Hacker\nCroll said Wednesday in a posting to an online discussion forum. “I’ve used social en-\ngineering only, no exploit, no xss vulnerability, no backdoor, no sql injection.”\nAccording to the information that Croll provided to TechCrunch, here is the rather\nsimple process that he followed to crack Twitter’s security and gain access to its files.\nUsing publicly available information, he built a profile of the company with emphasis\non creating an employee list.\nFor every employee identified, he looked for email addresses, birth dates, names of pets,\nspouses, and children.\nHe began accessing popular web services that each employee may have had an account\nwith, such as Gmail, Yahoo! mail, Hotmail, YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, etc., and\nusing the discovered email address as the username (which frequently is the case), he\ninitiated steps to recover the password. Passwords are often answers to standard ques-\ntions, such as “What is your mother’s maiden name? etc., or the service may provide\nan option to email the forgotten password to a secondary email address. This is where\nTwitterGate: A Real-World Example of a Social Engineering Attack with Dire Consequences | 97\nHacker Croll’s patient discovery of personal data combined with flawed security design\nand sheer luck to enable a successful hack.\nCroll tried to access a Twitter employee’s Gmail account. He opted for emailing the\nforgotten password to a secondary email address. Gmail provides users with a clue as\nto which email address they had picked by obscuring the first part but revealing the\nservice (***********@hotmail.com). Once he saw it was a Hotmail account, Croll went to\nHotmail and attempted to log in with the same username. Here is where luck stepped\nin: Hotmail’s response to Croll’s login attempt was that the account was no longer\nactive. Croll immediately re-registered the account with a password that he picked,\nthen went back to Gmail and requested that the forgotten password be emailed to the\nsecondary account, which Croll now owned. Gmail reset the password and sent out a\nnew one to the Hotmail account, thus giving Croll full access to a Twitter employee’s\npersonal email.\nHis next task was to discover the original password and reset it so that the employee\nwould never suspect that her email account had been hacked. Thanks to Gmail’s default\nof storing every email ever received by its members, Croll eventually found a welcome\nletter from another online service that, for the member’s benefit, fully disclosed her\nusername and password. Recognizing that 99% of web users stick with the same pass-\nword for everything, he reset the Gmail password to the one he just discovered, and\nthen waited for the Twitter employee to access her Gmail account. Sure enough, the\nemployee soon signed in, sent a few emails, and signed out, never suspecting a thing.\nNow armed with a valid username and password, Croll dug further into the employee’s\nGmail archives until he discovered that Twitter used Google Apps for domains as their\ncorporate email solution. Croll logged in with his stolen employee username and pass-\nword and began searching through all of that employee’s company emails, download-\ning attachments, and, in the process, discovered the usernames and passwords for at\nleast three senior Twitter executives, including CEO and Founder Evan Williams and\nCo-founder Biz Stone, whose email accounts he promptly logged into as well.\nCroll didn’t stop there either. He continued to expand his exploitation of Twitter data\nby logging into the AT&T website for cell phone records and iTunes for credit card\ninformation. (According to the TechCrunch article, iTunes has a security flaw that\nallows users to see their credit card numbers in plain text.)\nThe end result can be seen online, as TechCrunch published some of the stolen infor-\nmation, and the rest will probably find its way online eventually through other\nchannels.\nAlthough this real-life example of computer network exploitation (CNE) did not in-\nvolve a government or military website, the essential process is the same. Had this been\na successful SQL injection attack instead of a pure social engineering attack, all of the\nusernames and passwords would have been discovered in a matter of minutes and a\nfull dump of the contents of the company’s database would have occurred.\n98 | Chapter 6: Non-State Hackers and the Social Web"

You cannot visually identify the enemy, nor be sure\nwhat his nationality is. The one thing that you can count on is that someone has to pay\nfor the necessities of virtual combat. Therefore, one sound strategy in any cyber inves-\ntigation is to follow the money trail created by the necessary logistics of organizing a\ncyber attack—domain registration, hosting services, acquisition of software, band-\nwidth, and so on.\nFalse Identities\nOne of the main reasons why malicious activities can prosper online is due to lax ver-\nification of domain registration data, also known as WHOIS information. Starting with\nInternet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and continuing with\nhosting companies and accredited domain registrars of all sizes, verification is not uni-\nversally enforced.\nFortunately, one of the forensic methods that can crack false identity data is the global\ntrend toward social computing. In the digital world of the Internet, as in physical space,\nyou leave evidence of where you’ve been.\nIf you’re an ardent social computing fan who is active in Facebook, MySpace,\nLiveJournal, or Twitter, your virtual footprint will be very extensive. If you make your\nliving on the Internet as a web service provider or forum administrator, your footprint\nwill be even larger.\nThe IDC is an organization that studies how much data is generated by individuals and\nbusinesses each year (Figure 7-1). According to the IDC whitepaper “The Diverse and\nExploding Digital Universe” (March 2008), “the digital universe contained\n281,000,000,000 gigabytes, which works out to about 45 gigabytes per person on the\nplanet.” Of that, half is due to an individual’s actions online.

The expanding digital universe\nNow imagine that you want to create a forum to recruit, train, and launch cyber attacks\nagainst state networks or websites. You won’t use your real name or known alias for\nfear of reprisals. Instead you’ll create a fictitious name for your domain registration\nand/or server hosting plan that cannot be traced back to you.\nThis is not as easy as it sounds, because some domain registrars will attempt to verify\nthe authenticity of the information that you provide. Your name and address may also\nhave to match those attached to the credit card that you use to make the purchase. This\nposes a serious problem for those individuals who want to act surreptitiously.\nBecause of that, members of the cyber underground have identified which hosting pro-\nviders and domain registrars have lax verification and payment policies, and patronize\nthem exclusively. The Russian Business Network (RBN) is a prime example. Although\nthe RBN went dark in November 2007 after an increasing amount of attention was\nbeing paid to its operations, some of the IP blocks associated with it are still active.\nThe genius of the RBN was that it built a bulletproof loop that guaranteed its online\nbusinesses uninterrupted service, regardless of how many complaints were filed against\nits various websites.\nLike the RBN, the StopGeorgia.ru forum is part of a network that’s been bulletproofed.\nThe rest of this chapter walks you through the intricate relationships, aliases, and shell\ncompanies that were created to serve that purpose.

Our key finding in October 2008 was:\nWe assess with high confidence that the Russian government will likely continue its\npractice of distancing itself from the Russian nationalistic hacker community thus gaining\ndeniability while passively supporting and enjoying the strategic benefits of their actions.\nWhile forum members are quite open about their targets and methods, we were unable\nin this round of collection/analysis to find any references to state organizations guiding\nor directing attacks. There are several possible explanations as to why this is the case.\nThere was no external involvement or direction from State organizations\nOur collection efforts were not far-reaching or deep enough to identify these connections\nInvolvement by State organizations was done in an entirely non-attributable way.\nThe situation has since changed. In February 2009, the Russian media reported a story\nthat has provided new evidence pointing to how the Russian government sponsors and\npays leaders of Russian youth organizations to engage in information operations, up\nto and including hacking, to silence or suppress opposition groups.\nNashi\nNashi is short for Molodezhnoye demokraticheskoye antifashistskoye dvizhenye “Na-\nshi” (translation, “Youth Democratic Anti-Fascist Movement ‘Ours!’”). Its logo is\nshown in Figure 7-9. It was formed in 2005 to either counter the possibility of another\nyouth revolt like the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine or counter a growing interest\nin Nazism in Russia. Funding for the group purportedly comes from Russian business\nowners; however, there has been widespread speculation that it receives government\nfunding as well, which has been strengthened in recent days by the Anna Bukovskaya\nstory (related later in this section).\nFigure 7-9. The Nashi logo\nThe Kremlin and the Russian Internet | 115\nOne of the most important supporters of Nashi is Vladislav Surkov, the first deputy\nchief of the presidential staff and, more importantly, a man who has the ear of Russian\nPrime Minister Vladmir Putin.\nSurkov intends to use Nashi to enforce the Kremlin’s will regarding RUNET commu-\nnications, i.e., “Ensure the domination of pro-Kremlin views on the Internet” (pub-\nlished by The New Times Online in Russian, 16 Feb 09). That’s easier said then done,\nparticularly since that effort was tried and abandoned about 10 years ago by RUNET\nco-founder Anton Nosek.\nSurkov has a new plan that involves the enlistment of Russian youth organizations,\nincluding Nashi and United Russia. He has organized a March 2009 conference with\nabout 20 key people in the Russian blogging community, as well as leaders of the\naforementioned youth organizations, some of whom include:\n• Maksim Abrakhimov, the Voronezh commissar of the Nashi movement and\nblogger\n• Mariya Drokova, Nashi commissar and recipient of the Order for Services to the\nFatherland Second Class medal for her “energetic” work in the area of youth policy\n• Mariya Sergeyeva, leader of the United Russia youth wing Young Guard\n• Samson Sholademi, popular Russian blogger\n• Darya Mitina, former state duma deputy and Russian Communist Youth Union\nleader\nOther attendees included Russian spin doctors who specialize in controlling the mes-\nsages communicated via the blogosphere. The objective was a straightforward Infor-\nmation Operation:\nThe aim of the conference is to work out a strategy for information campaigns on the\nInternet. It is formulated like this: “To every challenge there should be a response, or\nbetter still, two responses simultaneously.”\nA source who is familiar with the process of preparations for the meeting explained:\nIf the opposition launches an Internet publication, the Kremlin should respond by\nlaunching two projects.\nIf a user turns up on LiveJournal talking about protests in Vladivostok, 10 Kremlin spin\ndoctors should access his blog and try to persuade the audience that everything that was\nwritten is lies.\nAlthough this campaign concerns internal Russian politics, it demonstrates the IO\nmodel that the Kremlin uses across the board, including what happened in Georgia in\nAugust 2008 thanks to the influence of Vladislov Surkov. His strategies were captured\nin the book Chronicles of Information War (Yevropa publishing house, Moscow, 2009),\nwritten by two Kremlin spin doctors, Maksim Zharov and Timofey Shevyakov.

Cyber crime is per-\npetrated by an attack on a network, just as is done in acts of cyber espionage or\ncomputer network exploitation (CNE). The malware used to gain access to backend\ndatabases is the same. In many cases, the same hackers are involved in cyber crime and\ngeopolitical attacks on foreign government websites, as is the case with one of the two\nhackers quoted above.\nThe hacker identified as “7” was also a member of the StopGeorgia.ru forum, albeit\nunder a different alias, and directly participated in attacks on Georgian government\nwebsites. 7 is also the one who inferred the involvement of the Russian mafia in un-\nderground cyber transactions such as the one from which that quote came\n(i.e., “…there are some big guys behind this money—they don’t ask who you are and\nwhy you are doing this. They’ll just break both your arms.”).\n121\nAssassination in the Russian Federation is a very real threat, and U.S. intelligence agen-\ncies believe that elements of Russian organized crime have infiltrated the police force.\nThat is why, the argument goes, so many assassinations remain unsolved.\nU.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been investigating Russian organ-\nized crime since the 1990s. According to one of my contact’s at one of the three-letter\nagencies, they were making some excellent progress in establishing links between\nmembers of organized crime and Russia’s political leadership.\nOnce 9/11 happened, that research was halted, as everyone was transferred to counter-\nterrorism, which pretty much dominated things until 2007.\n2007 was the year that the Russian Business Network (RBN) rose to prominence as a\nhigh-profit, low-risk criminal enterprise selling “bulletproof” services to anyone willing\nto pay its fee. Its business model of earning high profits with almost zero risk of being\ncaught made the RBN the darling of the Russian underworld.\nThen, in November 2007, the RBN seemed to vanish (Figure 8-1).\nFigure 8-1. 06 NOV 07 drop in traffic at AS40989\nOne thing that organized crime has always shied away from is the spotlight of media\nattention, and the RBN was getting a lot of it. One of the reporters responsible for\npenning story after story on their antics was Brian Krebs of the Washington Post. On\nOctober 13, 2007, three separate articles appeared on the Post’s Security Fix blog,\nwritten by Krebs.\n122 | Chapter 8: Organized Crime in Cyberspace\nKreb’s first article appeared in the main section of the Post, where he described the role\nof the RBN as a criminal services provider, referring to at what the time were recently\npublished reports from Internet security firms Verisign, Symantec, and SecureWorks.\nIn a follow-up article on the Security Fix blog, Krebs went into much more detail,\nnaming the upstream providers that the RBN relied on to provide its Internet connec-\ntivity: Tiscali.uk, SBT Telecom, Aki Mon Telecom, and Nevacon LTD (Figure 8-2).\nFigure 8-2. Map of companies providing network services to the RBN\nOrganized Crime in Cyberspace | 123\nHe also traced its history back to 2004, when it was known as “Too Coin Software”\nand “Value Dot,” and then walked his readers forward to its present iteration:\nNearly every major advancement in computer viruses or worms over the past two years\nhas emanated from or sent stolen consumer data back to servers at RBN, including such\nnotable pieces of malware as Gozi, Grab, Haxdoor, Metaphisher, Mpack, Ordergun,\nPinch, Rustock, Snatch, Torpig, and URsnif. The price for these malware products often\nincludes software support, and usually some virus writers guarantee that the custom\nversion created for the buyer will evade detection by anti-virus products for some period\nof time.\nDavid Bizeul is a French security researcher who has written one of the best reports on\nthe RBN to date (see Figure 8-3). He summed up its business focus quite succinctly:\nThe RBN offers a complete infrastructure to achieve malicious activities. It is a cyber\ncrime service provider. Whatever the activity is—phishing, malware hosting, gambling,\npornography…the RBN will offer the convenient solution to fulfill it.\nFigure 8-3. The RBN—a crime service provider\nIn any attempt to understand the influence of Russian organized crime in the cyber\nthreat domain, a key distinction must be made between organized crime in Russia and\nelsewhere.\nIn the U.S., the FBI and other agencies focus on how criminals may be infiltrating or,\nat the very least, influencing government offices. In Russia, the government infiltrates\norganized crime and establishes a reciprocal business relationship. The government\nprovides protection in exchange for favors. Favors may range from making money to\nusing a gang to implement state interests.\nRichard Palmer made a similar case in his testimony before the House Banking Com-\nmittee (September 21, 1999), wherein he explained how Russia is governed by the rule\n124 | Chapter 8: Organized Crime in Cyberspace"

According to Palmer, who spent 11\nyears with the Directorate of Operations at CIA, businesses operating inside the Russian\nFederation quickly learn that when it comes to collecting on bad debts or enforcing\ncontracts, it’s faster and cheaper to engage Russian criminals than wait for the Russian\ncourt system to take care of it. Unfortunately, the flip side of that equation is also true:\nit’s sometimes cheaper to have the person you owe money to killed than to repay a debt.\nIn the case of the RBN, once media attention became frequent enough, the FBI sent\nseveral officials to Moscow to meet with its counterparts in the Federal Security Service\n(FSB). The purpose of the meeting was to share information about the criminal activities\nof certain individuals associated with the RBN and how the Kremlin might want to\nremove such a presence from the Russian Internet. The Russian security officers ex-\ncused themselves, and when they returned approximately a half hour later, they in-\nformed the FBI officials that they must be mistaken, that no such domains existed on\nRuNet.\nBack at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, the FBI discovered that the more public domains\nformerly associated with the RBN had been migrated to new IP addresses.\nThat’s why it appeared that the RBN suddenly dropped from view. In reality it never\nwent away; it just slipped back under the radar, away from any further media spotlight.\nA Subtle Threat\nTell Krebs nice job on Atrivo, but if he’s thinking of doing McColo next, he’s pushing\nhis luck.\nInvestigating the Russian mob is one thing, but when an investigation may hurt profits,\nthat’s another, much more dangerous matter entirely.

It perfectly illustrates the key role that U.S.-based businesses play in provid-\ning protected platforms for Russian organized crime enterprises that, in turn, are\nutilized as attack platforms by non-state actors in nationalistic and religious actions.\nMcColo was formed by a 19-year-old Russian hacker and college student named\nNikolai, aka Kolya McColo. Upon his death in a car accident in Moscow in September,\n2007, the McColo company was taken over by McColo’s friend “Jux,” a “carder”\n(carders make their money in the underground market for stolen credit card data). The\namount of money being made by McColo makes it likely that it attracted the attention\nof Russian mobsters, which puts an entirely new spin on the possible cause for Kolya\nMcColo’s car accident.\nThe graphic in Figure 8-4, created by Brian Krebs, illustrates the extremely broad scope\nof McColo’s collection of botnets and bad hosts in terms of spam and cyber crime. The\nfollowing is Krebs’s explanation of what the graphic depicts:\nThe upper right-hand section of the graphic highlights the numeric Internet addresses\nassigned to McColo that experts, such as Joe Stewart, the director of malware research\nfor Atlanta-based SecureWorks, say were used by some of the most active and notorious\nspam-spewing botnets—agglomerations of millions of hacked PCs that were collectively\nresponsible for sending more than 75 percent of the world’s spam on any given day (for\nthat sourcing, see the colorful pie chart at below, which is internet security firm Mar\nshal.com’s current view of the share of spam attributed to the top botnets).

McColo hosting of cyber bad actors\nWhen McColo was de-peered (i.e., dropped by its Internet backbone providers, Global\nCrossing, Hurricane Electric, and Telia), worldwide spam rates dropped by 67%\novernight.\nAccording to the FBI, U.S. losses to Internet crime in 2008 amounted to $246.6 million.\nSince spam is the principal source of income for cyber criminals, McColo going offline\nrepresented a significant loss of revenue to criminal organizations, but it didn’t last long.\nThe authors of the botnets simply found other bandwidth resellers to take McColo’s\nplace. In fact, the entire issue of unvetted bandwidth reselling represents a serious na-\ntional security risk that must be addressed if nations want to begin to stem the tide of\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks generated by botnets against their websites.\nThis is particularly true for the U.S. government.\n128 | Chapter 8: Organized Crime in Cyberspace"

For example, most\nnetworks will have deployed intrusion detection systems, firewall and router traffic\nlogs, and access logs contained on the server itself. There exists a bevy of tools and\ntechniques that can allow an investigator to gain further insight using open source data.\nThis includes routing information from the border gateway protocol (BGP),* domain\nname system (DNS), darknet monitoring, blacklist services (such as those offered by\nSpamhaus, CBL, etc.), and, to a lesser degree, Internet registry information (e.g., ARIN,\nRIPE, APNIC, etc.).\nPerforming a traceroute on each IP will show an experienced computer security engi-\nneer where the attacks originated from and what path the packets took to get to the\ntarget.\nThis chapter takes a rudimentary look at these computer forensic tools by way of some\nreal-world examples.\nUsing Open Source Internet Data\nThe following serves as an introduction to several key internetworking concepts. This\nis fairly complex subject matter, and will be discussed only at a very high level here.\nThe border gateway protocol (BGP) is widely characterized as the “glue of the Internet.”\nEvery Internet service provider uses BGP to move packets between source and desti-\nnation nodes.

For example, using the\nTeam Cymru IP to ASN service it is possible to retrieve global routing information, as\nshown in Figure 9-1.\nThe screenshot shows that IP address 4.2.2.1 is routed by autonomous system (AS)\n3356, which is administered by Level 3 Communications. Another excellent resource\nis offered by RIPE.\nThe domain name system is another example of open source Internet data that can\ngreatly aid an investigation into suspected intrusion IP addresses. DNS is a global hi-\nerarchal system, which allows a user to translate a common name (www.foo.com, for\nexample) into an IP address. Based on its DNS name, it may be possible to uncover\ninformation that would help reveal the attacking IP address. For example, is the at-\ntacking machine a mail server or a web server? Could it be a router or a client machine\nlocated on a dial-up service? This information is very useful in determining technical\nattack attribution. There exist several online tools to assist in this search, including\nDomainTools.\nIt is also possible to leverage “black lists” to determine whether the suspect IP address\nhas been associated with any previous malfeasance, such as spamming, scanning, or\nmalware infection. Several organizations offer these services, including Spamhaus and\nthe SANS Internet Storm Center.\nBackground\nOn January 18, 2009, a large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack began\nagainst Kyrgyzstan Internet service providers (ISPs).

Unfortunately, not all providers perform their watchdog duties as\nwell as they should, including ICANN itself (although their rate of fraudulent regis-\ntrations has decreased recently).\nIn the case of StopGeorgia.ru, the domain was registered to an alias that appeared on\nnumerous spam sites (see Chapter 7). This works well with domain registration services\nthat do not perform verification checks on all new applications. Unfortunately, there\nare a number of companies that regard lax registration as a fair trade-off for an increase\nin sales revenue. This is a critical part of the puzzle for criminal enterprises operating\non the Internet.\nIn other cases, domains are registered with stolen data. In one case that was reported\nto me, the stolen data was from a U.S. serviceman deployed in Iraq. When he returned\nto the U.S. at the end of his tour, he was contacted by his service’s investigative division\nin reference to his “terrorist” website. The investigation was dropped once it was de-\ntermined that his identity had been stolen and used to register the domain name; how-\never, that determination didn’t happen in a timely manner and caused quite a bit of\nconsternation on the part of the serviceman and his family.\nNevertheless, checking WHOIS registrations does provide another link in the evidence\nchain. Sometimes mistakes are made and actual government websites are used as the\nidentifying data (e.g., GhostNet). This is rare, but it does happen. Part of any OSINT\ninvestigation is looking for the small oversights that even the most careful individuals\nmake from time to time.\nThe Cambridge University investigation of the Chinese espionage operation against the\nOffice of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL) underscores the value of checking\nWHOIS data:\nDuring our initial network monitoring exercise, we observed sensitive files being trans-\nferred out of the OHHDL using a modified HTTP protocol: the malware picked up files\nfrom local disks and sent them to three servers which, according to APNIC, were in\nChina’s Sichuan province, using a custom protocol based on HTTP. The malware uses\nHTTP GET and HTTP POST messages to transfer files out and also appears to verify\nsuccessful transmission. Sichuan, by the way, is the location of the Chinese intelligence\nunit specifically tasked with monitoring the OHHDL.\nWHOIS information can be checked with numerous free online Internet\ntoolkits, such as http://www.dnsstuff.com, http://www.robtex.com, http:\n//www.demon.net/external/, and http://www.whois.sc, simply by enter-\ning either a domain name (sans the “www”) or an IP address.\nUsing WHOIS | 139"

This information could be used as a foundation\nfor further attacks and intelligence gathering against related web applications.\n141"

This\nrepresents a compromise of an organization’s internal infrastructure.\n• Once the underlying system is compromised, it can be used as a stepping stone for\nfurther attacks against an organization’s internal network.

If an application does not provide the correct validation for user-\nsupplied input parameters, an attacker could embed SQL commands within the pa-\nrameters passed from the web application to the backend database.\nThe result is that the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries and/or commands on\nthe backend database server, using the web application as the delivery mechanism. SQL\ninjection is a critical application issue and typically results in the loss of all the data\nstored within the database and a compromise of the system housing the database. Ad-\nditional information on generic SQL injection attacks can be found at http://www.owasp\n.org/index.php/SQL_injection.\nIf a hacker discovers a SQL injection vulnerability on a website, but the SQL injection\ndoes not return any readable data, this is known as “blind” SQL injection. The blind\nSQL injection vulnerability executes an attacker-controlled SQL query on the backend\ndatabase with no indication as to whether the injected query actually succeeded or\nfailed.\nHackers turned to the BENCHMARK stored procedure (for SQL injection against\nMySQL databases) to get some indication as to whether their injected SQL query suc-\nceeded or failed. By including a Boolean clause (true or false) in the blind SQL injection,\n142 | Chapter 10: Weaponizing Malware\nthe hacker can craft a SQL injection in such a fashion so that if the query is successful\n(and only if it is successful), the database runs the BENCHMARK query.\nThe BENCHMARK queries chosen by the hacker are CPU-intensive, typically crypto\nfunctions run thousands of times. Since these CPU-intensive BENCHMARK queries\ntake time to complete, the backend becomes “stalled” until the BENCHMARK is com-\npleted. If the hacker launches the blind SQL injection with a CPU-intensive BENCH-\nMARK and the application “stalls” for a few seconds before displaying the page, the\nhacker knows the SQL injection was successful. Conversely, if the attacker launches\nthe blind SQL injection with a CPU-intensive BENCHMARK and the application im-\nmediately displays the page, the hacker knows the SQL injection was not successful.\nVisit http://www.milw0rm.com/papers/149 for more information about using the\nBENCHMARK stored procedure for blind SQL injection. It’s interesting to note that\nthe hacker who wrote the tutorial is trying to reduce the CPU load involved with\nBENCHMARK usage in order to avoid detection/server-performance issues.\nNow, the specific techniques suggested in the StopGeorgia.ru forum were a new twist\non those for typical SQL injection vulnerability exploitation. Some posters to the forum\nsuggested the using the BENCHMARK stored procedure to consume massive amounts\nof CPU cycles on the backend database. BENCHMARK has been a popular technique\nfor blind SQL injection, but using it to intentionally cause a DoS is rare.\nThe forum suggested that attackers use SQL injection vulnerabilities to call a CPU-\nintensive task (built-in crypto functions) for the backend database to execute hundreds\nof thousands of times. One post suggested that nested BENCHMARKs be used, each\nrunning 100,000 times (that equates to 100,000 × 100,000, or about 10,000,000,000\ntimes)! These queries would simply consume the CPU for the system hosting the\ndatabase (often it’s the same machine as the web server).\nBy using BENCHMARK, a single web request can cause a significant load on the\ndatabase server, and in most cases a single machine can render the database server\ninoperative. Specific SQL injection points were identified on the forums, as well as\nobserved in collected web server logs. SQL injection was undoubtedly used in attacks\nagainst Georgia servers.\nThe BENCHMARK stored procedure is specific to MySQL databases,\nbut other popular databases have similar functionality. Other specific\ntechniques mentioned in both forums for bringing down or gaining il-\nlicit access to machines included:\n• Regularly checking the status of a host through ping –t <host> -i\n<interval>\n• Using SQL injection through an improperly sanitized query string\n• Brute-force attacks\n• Social engineering to gain passwords\nA New Threat Landscape | 143"

    "output": "Twitter As DDoS Command Post Against Iran\nThe mid-June 2009 Iranian elections were so flawed that opposition protests, fueled\nby harsh Iranian government treatment against protesters, overflowed onto the Inter-\nnet, creating a wave of instant support for the protesters and fury against the Iranian\ngovernment after Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defeated rival Mir Hussein\nMoussavi in a contested election.\nOfficial Iranian filtering targeted news media of all types, so Iranian dissidents turned\nto posting photos and videos on Internet sites such as YouTube and various blogging\nplatforms. Protests, when interrupted by Iranian police, turned violent, and within a\nfew days eight fatalities were reported.\nThe coordinating medium for this outrage was none other than Twitter, the micro-\nblogging service that has defied attempts by journalists, politicians, and comedians to\ncategorize it as a tool of the self-absorbed.\nIn fact, Twitter has proven its value as a real-time reporting service in crisis environ-\nments, for example, Mumbai during the November 2008 terrorist attacks. In the Iranian\ncrisis, the Twitter platform was used by Iranians upset with the election results that\nshowed the current President achieving a landslide victory.\nLinks to automated DDoS tools were circulated, along with recommended target web-\nsites. Here’s an example of the script used by one such tool (Figure 10-1), provided by\nJose Nazario on his blog Security to the Core:\nHere’s a peek at one such script, using the “page reboot” site as a basis for the tools. Page\nreboot uses a very simple method, namely use Javascript to reload the URL in the page\nrepeatedly. The browser will happily do so, just like the user was sitting there hitting F5\nin their Internet Explorer. This can cause some stress on the attacker’s specific machine,\nreveals their IPs through the HTTP connections, and is trivial to filter, but is growing in\npopularity.\nIn this case someone’s put together a single page of HTML with multiple “IFRAME”\nelements which embed the remote page into the local page. This is a simple magnifier of\nthe local site’s effect but has the effect of diminishing results: the attacker’s machine\nslows down for all attacks as it loads them and consumes more bandwidth as it loads all\nof the pages again and again.\nA Norwegian journalist created a “Cyberwar Guide for Beginners” that provides guid-\nance in a number of areas of interest to the global online community who is watching\nevents unfold and wants to do something to help.\nThe purpose of this guide is to help you participate constructively in the Iranian election\nprotests through twitter:\n1. Do NOT publicise proxy IP’s over twitter, and especially not using the #iranelection\nhashtag. Security forces are monitoring this hashtag, and the moment they identify\na proxy IP they will block it in Iran. If you are creating new proxies for the Iranian\nbloggers, DM them to @stopAhmadi or @iran09 and they will distributed them\ndiscretely to bloggers in Iran.\n144 | Chapter 10: Weaponizing Malware\nFigure 10-1. IFRAME elements embed a remote page into a local page\n2. Hashtags, the only two legitimate hashtags being used by bloggers in Iran are #ira-\nnelection and #gr88, other hashtag ideas run the risk of diluting the conversation.\n3. Keep your bull$hit filter up! Security forces are now setting up twitter accounts to\nspread disinformation by posing as Iranian protesters. Please don’t retweet impe-\ntously, try to confirm information with reliable sources before retweeting. The le-\ngitimate sources are not hard to find and follow.\n4. Help cover the bloggers: change your twitter settings so that your location is\nTEHRAN and your time zone is GMT +3.30. Security forces are hunting for bloggers\nusing location and timezone searches. If we all become ‘Iranians’ it becomes much\nharder to find them.\n5. Don’t blow their cover! If you discover a genuine source, please don’t publicise their\nname or location on a website. These bloggers are in REAL danger. Spread the word\ndiscretely through your own networks but don’t signpost them to the security forces.\nPeople are dying there, for real, please keep that in mind.\n6. Denial of Service attacks. If you don’t know what you are doing, stay out of this\ngame. Only target those sites the legitimate Iranian bloggers are designating. Be\naware that these attacks can have detrimental effects to the network the protesters\nare relying on. Keep monitoring their traffic to note when you should turn the taps\non or off.\n7. Do spread the (legitimate) word, it works! When the bloggers asked for twitter\nmaintenance to be postponed using the #nomaintenance tag, it had the desired\neffect. As long as we spread good information, provide moral support to the pro-\ntesters, and take our lead from the legitimate bloggers, we can make a constructive\ncontribution.\nPlease remember that this is about the future of the Iranian people, while it might be\nexciting to get caught up in the flow of participating in a new meme, do not lose sight of\nwhat this is really about.\nUnfortunately, by engaging in DDoS attacks, an individual may contribute to the clo-\nsure of Internet access by the Iranian government, thus shutting off the very life line\nthat the Iranian opposition needs to build the support of the global community.\nA New Threat Landscape | 145"

A big part of Tehran’s control derives from all\nInternet traffic being routed through one bottleneck—the Telecommunications Com-\npany of Iran (TCI). Another is the prohibition against private citizens subscribing to\nhigh-speed service.\nThe single greatest takeaway for social media advocates in the Iranian elections is that\nthere is nothing clear cut about the event nor the usefulness of the tool. Individuals’\neagerness to join in the DDoS flood may be putting the very people that they wish to\nhelp at risk. Those looking with a non-critical eye to tweets for “real,” as-it-happens\ninformation may be reading an Iranian government disinformation post. There is a\ncommensurate increase in risk and reward.\nSocial Engineering\nA group of Canadian researchers recently uncovered a massive Chinese computer es-\npionage ring (GhostNet) involving almost 1,300 infected computers in 103 countries.\nAccording to their report, about 30% of the infected hosts were located in government\noffices, media companies, and non-government organizations (NGOs).\nThe malware used, a type of Trojan known as a remote access tool (RAT), was of\nChinese design and named gh0st RAT. Once infected, the attacker gained complete\ncontrol of the host computer, including the ability to:\n• Activate a web cam and conduct audio and video surveillance\n• Search for and exfiltrate sensitive documents\n• Initiate keylogging to capture usernames and passwords\nOne of the many interesting lessons derived from the GhostNet investigation is that\nnone of the espionage tools or techniques that was used so successfully were new. It\nwas basically a variant of the old Spear Phishing scheme, which is when an attacker\nsends out a carefully worded email message to an organization or company that features\nhighly focused content.\nFor example, the email message used to spread the gh0st RAT Trojan contained the\nfollowing subject line: “Translation of Freedom Movement ID Book for Tibetans in\nExile.”\nThe email message contained the emblem of the Tibetan Government in Exile, and the\nattached .doc file had the same title as the subject line. When clicked, the file apparently\nopened normally; however, once opened, a series of unfortunate events followed:\n1. A vulnerability on the user’s machine was exploited and the malware was loaded.\n2. Once installed, the malware attempted to make contact with its control server.\n3. Any operator with access to the control server’s interface could then gain complete\ncontrol of the infected computer and access to the network to which it belonged.\n146 | Chapter 10: Weaponizing Malware\nAnti-virus software frequently did not detect this Trojan. According to the report’s\nauthors, only 11 of 34 anti-virus programs successfully quarantined the infected docu-\nment; the other 23 simply didn’t catch it.\nIn 2006, Australia’s CERT announced an 80% miss rate by anti-virus (AV) programs\nin stopping malware, principally because hackers will test their code against existing\nAV programs until it escapes detection.\nThis underscores one of the most important points in understanding any cyber defense\nstrategy: both states and enterprises that must defend sensitive data from malicious\naccess cannot rely solely upon technology to protect them. The human element, with\nall of its strengths and weaknesses, is paramount.\nWhile millions of people of all ages enjoy many of the benefits of being connected to\nthe Web, it also raises their risk for being victimized by an online scam or attack. The\nmore information a cyber criminal knows about his target, the easier it is to create an\nattractive lure, and the more likely it is that an unsuspecting individual (as demonstra-\nted by the GhostNet investigation) will take the bait.\nSocial media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Plaxo, and LinkedIn meet legitimate\nnetworking needs among professional adults; however, they are concurrently being\ntracked, mined, searched, and ranked for marketing purposes by companies such as\nNielson Buzzmetrics, Visible Technologies, and other firms that perform brand-mon-\nitoring and name-recognition services for businesses.\nSocial engineering as a tactic for hackers precedes all of the previously mentioned\nservices by many years. In fact, the “old-school” approach consisted of dumpster diving\nand other “meat space” techniques used to gather user login and password information\nfrom target companies. Thanks to the rapidly growing social media space, those old-\nschool techniques have given way to a completely online approach.\nThe Government 2.0 movement of 2009 highlights many of the benefits that might\naccrue with the use of social software by government officials and agencies, including\nproviding a real-time gauge for evaluating public sentiment during key moments of\nnational or international events and policy debate.\nThe negative aspects relate directly to social engineering hacks. Government employ-\nees’ user profiles, not to mention their posts, often contain personal data that a moti-\nvated hacker could leverage into an attack similar to the one described in the GhostNet\ncase.\nSince there are legitimate uses for this information as well as nefarious ones, specialty\nInternet search engines are being created that focus on the social web.

Traditionally such life details are expressed on\ndiverse channels—unobservable to any single entity. No more. Facebook, with this pan-\noramic view of its users, now likely has a substantially more complete picture of a person\nthan almost any other single entity.\nHow powerful is this? Here is one example: if you are a Facebook user maybe you have\nnoticed the increasingly (spooky smart) relevant ads. I get ads that read “Are you 44, a\ntriathlete, and want abs like this?” Or a well-timed ad over the summer when I was in\nSouthern California that read: “Are you looking for a triathlete coach in the Orange\nCounty area?” It is so relevant I find it very hard not to click on the ad! (Be assured I do\nresist.)\nThe more sense Facebook makes of users, the better the service, the more folks will find\nFacebook irreplaceable, the more users will flock to the platform, and last but not least,\nthe more advertisers are willing to pay. Everyone seems the winner.\nAn Adversary’s Look at LinkedIn\nLinkedIn and other social networking sites are essentially trust networks, but with little\nin the way of authentication. Therefore the obvious question—how reliable is the trust\nthat is extended?—remains a difficult one to answer.\nNitesh Dhanjani, a computer security expert who specializes in the financial sector,\nbelieves that the problem will grow worse and that our privacy, reputations, and iden-\ntities are stake. (See his book Hacking: The Next Generation [O’Reilly]).\nNitesh points to LinkedIn as an example. Imagine that you are a consultant with a\nprofile at LinkedIn. Your contact list represents intellectual property and you want to\nprotect it from the prying eyes of your competitors. At the same time, it may benefit\nyou to share that property in a way that is mutually beneficial. This requires a way to\nauthenticate the identity of each member, something that doesn’t yet exist on any social\nnetworking site, including LinkedIn.\nFrom an adversarial point of view, how would one take advantage of this situation?\nSince LinkedIn builds its identity-management structure around email addresses, a\nsocial engineering hack would probably take advantage of that. Email addresses are\neasy to spoof, so all one needs to do to access a target contact list is to get the target to\nconnect with a fake LinkedIn account.

In 2008, there were so many\nviruses being created that Symantec needed to write a new signature every 20 seconds.\nIn 2009, it changed to every 8 seconds.\nAs of this writing, Triumfant’s Worldwide Malware Signature Counter is displaying\n3,704,642 malware signatures needed by AV software to be up to date.

This section\ndiscusses the means by which targeted attacks are executed. The attack described here\nis based on actual attacks that have occurred. Several technical details have been\nchanged, but the major characteristics of the attacks are intact.\nResearch is the key to offensive capabilities\nSophisticated, targeted attacks begin with research. A tremendous amount of time,\nmoney, and human brain power is dedicated to finding new vulnerabilities in widely\nused software such as Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer, Mozilla FireFox, and even\nthe most widely used operating system in the world, Microsoft Windows. When a new\nvulnerability is discovered, the discovering organization gains an advantage: it has a\nweapon that that doesn’t have a specific defense, and the defender has zero knowledge\nthat the exploit exists. These vulnerabilities are known as “0day” (pronounced “zero\nday” or sometimes “oh-day”) vulnerabilities. These 0day vulnerabilities are the “tip of\nthe spear” in the offensive cyber world. These attacks result in a tremendous amount\nof damage, and the victim seldom realizes they’ve been compromised. DDoS attacks\ngain a lot of media attention because they are noisy and easy to detect, but targeted\n0day attacks with custom attack payloads are silent, almost impossible to detect reli-\nably, and represent the most powerful attack available to offensive cyber units. It is\nthese types of attacks that represent the true capability of an offensive cyber unit.\nIn this example, the attacking organization has found vulnerability in the word-\nprocessing software Microsoft Word. Word is popular widely used the U.S. govern-\nment, and the attacker knows that. For the sake of clarity, the specific technical details\nof the exploit will not be covered; instead, this section will cover the major points of\nthe vulnerability.\nFirst, it is important to understand that prior to Microsoft Office 2007, all Office docu-\nments were served as a binary file format.\nMore information about binary file formats can be found on Wikipedia\nat http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file.\nPrograms like Microsoft Word that consume binary file formats have a reputation of\nbeing difficult to secure and have been known to be affected by vulnerabilities that can\n152 | Chapter 10: Weaponizing Malware\ncorrupt the memory of the computer system attempting to parse the binary file format.\nIf an attacker can corrupt the system’s memory in a controlled manner (through the\nuse of what is known as “shellcode”), then the attacker will be able to gain access to\nthe target system.\nThe exploit, along with the attacker’s shellcode, is hidden deep inside the raw binary\ncontents of the malicious Word document. The binary structure of the Word document\nmakes it impossible for the average user to determine whether the it contains malicious\ncode. For example, Figure 10-2 shows a typical Word document as displayed by\nMicrosoft Word.\nFigure 10-2. Microsoft Word document as viewed in Microsoft Word\nOpening the same document in a hex editor shows the raw contents of the file, which\nare quite different than what the user sees within Microsoft Word. The average user\nwill not be able to comprehend or detect whether malicious content exists within the\nbinary structure of the Word file. It is within this raw binary data where the attacker\nwill place his exploit and shellcode. A portion of the raw binary contents are shown in\nFigure 10-3.

    "output": "Figure 10-3. Raw data content from a Microsoft Word document\nDelivery of targeted attacks\nOnce the attacking organization has discovered and developed a suitable exploit for a\n0day vulnerability, the attacking organization moves onto the target-selection phase.\nMany times, target selection is given two primary considerations: the value of the in-\nformation that will be obtained from a particular target and the difficulty of successful\nexploitation (to include likelihood of detection). 0day exploits often are deployed\nagainst personnel who have security clearance, are directly responsible for handling\nsensitive data, or can provide a stepping stone into a targeted organization. This makes\nhigh-ranking officials an attractive target for attacks. The costs of developing a reliable\nexploit in popular software is reasonably high, and sophisticated organizations will\ndeploy 0day exploits only against those targets that will yield a solid return on vulner-\nability investment. Organizations deploying 0day exploits are careful to avoid detection\nbecause once the 0day is detected, it quickly loses value, as patches are developed and\nspecific countermeasures are put in place. The technical sophistication and technical\nreliability of the exploit will greatly affect the likelihood of detection (or lack thereof).\nOnce the exploit to be used is chosen and the target selected, the attacker must deliver\nthe exploit to the target. One of the most popular delivery methods for 0day exploits\nis email. Email is the lifeblood for many organizations, allowing for the exchange of\ninformation in an effective and convenient manner. Virtually every email server blocks\ndangerous file types such as executable (.exe) files, batch files (.bat), and scripts (.vbs),\nbut almost every email server allows Word documents (.doc) or other Office documents\n154 | Chapter 10: Weaponizing Malware\nto be delivered. In this case, the attacker delivers the exploit hidden deep inside a Word\ndocument, allowing it to travel unabated through the victim organization’s networks\nto the intended target.\nSophisticated attackers do not simply identify the email address of the target and send\naway; extensive reconnaissance is done before the actual exploit is sent. Collection of\nupcoming travel agendas, known associates, naming conventions for documents, and\nother details help build creditability and increase the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMuch of this information can be gleaned from public sources such as Google or public\nwebsites. Figures 10-4 and 10-5 show some of the types of information that can be\nretrieved about high-profile targets with open source intelligence (OSINT).\nFigure 10-4. Sensitive information found via OSINT\nFigure 10-5. Contact information for military units found through OSINT\nSophisticated organizations use OSINT and traditional intelligence-gathering methods\nto collect a good operational “picture” of the target. For example, if an attacker has\nidentified a commanding officer (CO) of a unit within one of the U.S. military branches\nas the target, he would spend time to enumerate several associates that work closely\nwith the CO. If the attacker has obtained a list of contacts (like the one shown in\nFigure 10-5), he could contact various members of the CO’s staff, collecting bits of\nintelligence to paint the operational picture surrounding around him.

Generally speaking, today’s\nmalware is never written to disk and is stored only in the system’s memory. This makes\nthe forensics effort extremely difficult. Researchers from Core Security Technologies\nand researcher John Heasman from NGSSoftware Insight Security Research have dem-\nonstrated practical examples of how memory and PCI-based rootkits can be deployed\nagainst targets.\nAdditionally, gone are the days when compromised systems transmitted stolen data in\nthe clear, directly back to the attackers’ systems. Today’s sophisticated malware takes\nexcruciating steps to hide its communication and intentions. Encrypted commands,\ncommunications over HTTP and decentralized command and control, and exfiltration\nof data through covert means are the norm. For example, take the advanced versions\nof the Nugache malware. Researchers Dave Dittrich from the University of Washington\nand Sven Dietrich from the Stevens Institute of Technology studied the Nugache mal-\nware and demonstrated how it used 256-bit Rijndael to encrypt P2P command and\ncontrol communication. Due to the implementation of proper crypto algorithms, even\nafter the researchers had full access to runtime in memory data structures, the re-\nsearchers were able to decrypt data flow in only one direction.\nWhy client-side 0day vulnerabilities can be so devastating\nClient-side exploits target software installed on a victim’s system. Web browsers, web\nbrowser plug-ins (Java, Flash, Silverlight, etc.), word-processing software, PDF readers,\nand even the operating system itself are all considered client-side software. On the other\nhand, server-side software includes web and email servers.\nClient-side 0day exploits have gained popularity with organizations employing offen-\nsive operations. Discovering vulnerabilities in a popular client-side component affects\nmillions of users, and the research required to discover them can be done covertly, with\nno external indication that it is being conducted.

First, once\nthe exploit is developed, the attacker typically has a multitude of delivery mechanisms\navailable (web pages, Word documents, PDFs, Flash files, etc.), many of which are\nallowed through the firewall. For example, virtually all corporate firewalls allow their\nusers to browse web pages and receive emails. This gives attackers the ability to cir-\ncumvent perimeter security measures such as firewalls and virtual private networks\n(VPNs). As mentioned in previous sections, anti-virus technology simply cannot keep\nup with known threats, much less 0day exploits of which they have no knowledge.\nOnce attackers successfully exploit a client-side vulnerability, they not only gain access\nto all the data and information located on the compromised system, they also gain\naccess to all the resources available to it. For example, if the compromised system is\npart of a larger network, the attacker gains access to that larger network. In this sense,\nthe attacker uses the compromised machine as a stepping-stone for further attacks in\nthe internal network. Often internal resources are not as well protected as Internet-\nfacing resources, making them easy targets for attackers who have gained access to\ninternal networks.\nProtecting against 0day exploits\nThere is simply no specific defense against 0day exploits. Each 0day exploit is unique,\nand only the attacker knows the full details of the 0day vulnerability. However, there\nare some steps that an organization can take to minimize the damage done by 0day\nvulnerabilities.\nDefense in Depth. There is simply no substitute for defense in-depth for organizations.\nDefenses are layered, protecting sensitive data and critical systems through many\ndifferent types of defense mechanisms. This forces the attacker to increase the intelli-\ngence-gathering effort needed for successful exploitation, as he will have to understand\neach defensive layer protecting the desired information. A solid defense in Depth strat-\negy also dramatically increases the sophistication and effort required for a successful\nexploit, as the attacker must now bypass many defenses and not just one. Defense in\nDepth cannot guarantee safety from exploitation attempts by sophisticated attackers,\nbut it does increase the footprint and increase the likelihood of early detection.\nUsing technologies such as MOICE and virtualization. Office documents are becoming increas-\ningly popular attack surfaces. Until Microsoft transitioned to an XML format for their\nOffice documents, files such as Microsoft Word (.doc), PowerPoint (.ppt), and Excel\n(.xls) documents were binary formats. Binary formats are tremendously challenging to\nparse and consume, opening up a large attack surface. There has been a surge in Mi-\ncrosoft Office–related exploits in the past few years due to its popularity in large cor-\nporations and governments. To combat this rise, Microsoft has developed the Microsoft\nOffice Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) to help “reduce the security risk”\n158 | Chapter 10: Weaponizing Malware"

A common operational security measure\nwithin government and military networks is the physical separation of networks ac-\ncording to classification of data. Unclassified information is physically separated from\ndata marked SECRET, which is in turn separated from data marked TOP SECRET.\nThe physical separation of data represents one of the most effective means of reducing\nthe attack surface for extremely sensitive data. The physical separation of networks also\ncarries with it significant operational overhead. The amount of effort required for users\nof that data to traverse between classified and unclassified networks can be high, es-\npecially in time-critical situations. Additionally, although separation of data networks\nallows for more stringent controls to be placed on those networks containing classified\ninformation, it also requires additional resources.\nResources are finite in every organization, which means building a robust set of defenses\nfor classified networks will often come at a cost for the defenses for unclassified net-\nworks. Normally, the decision to allocate resources to classified networks as opposed\nto unclassified networks is clear cut, but in this day of OSINT and ubiquitous social\nmedia, a savvy collection of unclassified pieces can give an adversary a clear picture of\nclassified operations.\nA New Threat Landscape | 159"

We have identified\nseveral, based on all-source intelligence information,\nthat are pursuing government-sponsored offensive cyber\nprograms. Foreign nations have begun to include infor-\nmation warfare in their military doctrine, as well as\ntheir war college curricula, with respect to both defen-\nsive and offensive applications. They are developing\nstrategies and tools to conduct information attacks.”\n—John A. Serabian, Jr., Information Operations Issue\nManager, Central Intelligence Agency, before the Joint\nEconomic Committee on Cyber Threats and\nthe U.S. Economy, February 23, 2000\nThis chapter examines the military doctrines for cyber warfare being developed by the\nRussian Federation (RF), the People’s Republic of China, and the United States of\nAmerica. Over 120 nations are engaged in developing this capability, and so a complete\nsurvey of each is beyond the scope of this book. Source material contained in this\nchapter includes published papers and speeches, as well as entries from official military\njournals. Readers are highly encouraged to look at all sources rather than cherry-picking\nonly the “official” ones.\nThe Russian Federation\nOf China, Russia, and the U.S., Russia has been the most active country in its imple-\nmentation of cyber attacks against its adversaries, which include Chechnya, Kyrgyz-\nstan, Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia, and Ingushetia. Whether or not you accept that\nsome, all, or none of these events occurred with the sanction of the Kremlin, each event\nhas been instrumental in furthering RF policy, and the Kremlin has never acted to stop\nthem. Hence the RF benefits.\n161\nLike China, Russian military interest in developing an information warfare (IW) strat-\negy goes back to at least the mid-1990s, when the Duma Subcommittee for Information\nSecurity expressed suspicion that the recent purchase of telecommunications boards\nmade in the U.S. contained a secret switch that, when tripped, would shut down Rus-\nsia’s telephone system. This fear isn’t unique to Russia. For example, the U.S. has\nrefused to purchase electronic boards from Chinese defense manufacturer Huawei for\nessentially the same reason. In Russia’s case, fear progressed to action, and a few years\nlater, new faculty with advanced degrees in computer networks and information se-\ncurity were hired to teach at the FSB academy.\nA report by the Institute for Security Technology Studies at Dartmouth College provides\na detailed history of the buildup of RF cyber warfare doctrine, starting with their Rev-\nolution in Military Affairs (RMA) in the 1980s. Ever since then, Russia has been re-\nsearching a wide variety of computer network attack (CNA) options, including logic\nbombs, viruses, microchipping, and other forms of weaponized malware.\nAlso ike China, Russia considers the U.S. to be the leader and the instigator in a cyber\narms race, and it has reportedly engaged in cyber espionage activities in an operation\nthat the FBI dubbed Moonlight Maze.\nBob Drogin of the Los Angeles Times reported that the FBI was investigating cyber\nbreak-ins at a wide range of sensitive government facilities, including several U.S. na-\ntional laboratories, NASA, some unnamed defense contractors, and various universities\nconducting sensitive research. The FBI was able to trace the penetrations back to Rus-\nsian servers within 20 miles of Moscow. Senator Robert Bennett took it one step further\nand placed the blame squarely on the doorstep of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nA few years later it was China’s turn with the massive—and some say still ongoing—\ncyber espionage effort code-named Titan Rain.\nRussia soon moved from what contemporary cyber warfare theory terms computer\nnetwork exploitation (CNE) to computer network attack during the latter days of the\nsecond Chechen war of 1997–2001 in an effort to control information flow. Chechen\ntargets included kavkaz.org and chechinpress.com (now defunct) and were of sufficient\nsize to knock both sites off the air.\nFollowing Chechnya were joint cyber-kinetic attacks in Estonia and Georgia, and cyber-\nonly attacks in Kyrgyzstan and Lithuania. In July and August 2009, escalating violence\nin Ingushetia was accompanied by denial of service (Dos) attacks against the main voice\nof protest against the Kremlin-controlled ruling government: http://www.ingushetia\n.org. The owner of the original site, Ingushetia.ru, was killed by Ingush police while in\ncustody in August 2008.\nWhat follows is an examination of Russian military doctrine and influences in infor-\nmation warfare, of which cyber is a component.\n162 | Chapter 11: The Role of Cyber in Military Doctrine"

    "output": "The Foundation for Effective Politics (FEP)\nThe FEP was founded by Gleb Olegovich Pavlovsky, born in Odessa on March 5, 1951.\nPavlovsky self-identifies as a “political technologist,” which makes perfect sense in\ntoday’s connected world. He’s what Western technologists consider an early adopter,\ncreating programs for the Russian Internet (RUNET) in its earliest days of existence,\nstarting with the Russkiy Zhurnal and later the Internet-based ezines Gazeta.ru,\nLenta.ru, and Inosmi.ru.\nPavlovsky’s leadership of FEP has been peppered with frequent Russian press articles\nthat accuse him of dirty deeds supporting government power. For example, on De-\ncember 4, 1997, an Obschchaya Gazeta article accused Pavlovsky of planting informa-\ntion detrimental to Boris Berezovskiy. The article reviewed Pavlovsky’s career path,\npointing out his shift from Yeltsin opponent to Yeltsin supporter and his subsequent\neconomic prosperity. On December 10, 1997, Moskovskiy Komsolets stated that Pav-\nlovsky provided political analysis to government figures at the direction of Anatoliy\nChubays, then head of the presidential administration.\nA January 18, 1999, Ekspert article by Pavlovsky is quite prescient and suggests excel-\nlent connections. In the article, Pavlovsky states that Russian society demands a right-\nwing conservative government. As Pavlovsky says, “After a decade of unregulated, es-\nsentially uncontrolled changes in the country, a shift towards a strong authoritative\nstate is preordained.” By August, Vladimir Putin was prime minister and by December\nhe was acting president. Numerous Russian press articles from 1999 detail Pavlovsky’s\nrise as a trusted political operative who moved from supporting Yeltsin to Putin. Indeed,\non December 24, 1999, Segodyna credited Pavlovsky with inspiring Putin’s new Center\nfor Strategic Studies, which was tasked to work out plans for Russia’s future\ndevelopment.\nPavlovsky’s FEP was also an early force on the Russian Internet. FEP’s original website,\nFEP.ru, is no longer active, but archived information shows the website active from\n1998 through 2007. The site touts FEP’s expertise in Internet operations, providing\nexamples of sites FEP developed supporting Russian political figures and their cam-\npaigns. However, contemporaneous press articles accuse Pavlovsky of disseminating\ndisinformation via the same routes.\nA few years later, the Kremlin favored the publishing houses of Konstantin Rykov’s\nNewmedia Stars, as well as Dni.ru, Vzglyad.ru, and the video portal Rossiya.ru. Rykov\nwas rewarded with a seat at the State Duma.\nToday the new favorites include Pravda.ru, Yoki.ru, Elektorat.info, and Politonlayn.ru,\nall published by Vadim Gorshenin, who is friendly with former United Russia PR chief\nKonstantin Kostin, deputy chief of the presidential staff’s Domestic Policy Adminis-\ntration since 2008.\nThe Russian Federation | 163"

His\norganization created the Yevropa publishing house, the publisher of Chronicles of In-\nformation Warfare (English translation of the Russian name) by Maksim Sharov and\nTomofey Shevyakov.\nThe book covers guidance provided by First Deputy Chief of Staff to the President of\nRussia and former GRU Intelligence Officer Vladislav Surkov.

He then acknowledges Russia’s response:\nFor this purpose specialized subdivisions are being created in the armed forces and special\nservices, conceptual documents regulating questions of preparation and conducting in-\nformation operations are being developed, and appropriate training is being conducted.\nBurutin goes on to discuss how Russia, as a world leader, has always been a target for\nlesser countries that aspire to Russia’s dominant position, through the use of relatively\ninexpensive communication strategies promulgating anti-Russian sentiment. He then\nproposes some additional measures that the RF should take to protect itself:\n• Systematic efforts to reveal threats in the information sphere and their sources,\ncreate a structural framework for the goals and tasks of ensuring information se-\ncurity in the field of defense and to realize these goals and tasks\n• Active counteraction to influence the consciousness of the population with the\npurpose of changing national ideology\n• Development of a domestic technological and production base in the field of in-\nformation technologies\n• Increase of information and telecommunications systems security, as well as of the\nsystems and means of introducing information technologies in weaponry and mili-\ntary equipment, and troop and weapons control systems\n• Improvement of the structure for ensuring information security in the area of\ndefense\n• Preparation of experts in the field of ensuring information security\nAnalysis.

The authors propose the following definition for\ninformation warfare:\n[The] main objectives will be to disorganize (disrupt) the functioning of the key enemy\nmilitary, industrial and administrative facilities and systems, as well as to bring\ninformation-psychological pressure to bear on the adversary’s military-political leader-\nship, troops and population, something to be achieved primarily through the use of state-\nof-the-art information technologies and assets.\nThey also warn readers that the U.S. is already fully capable of embarking on “psycho-\nlogical and technical information operations,” and site three documents to support\ntheir view:\n• DOD Directive No. 3600.1, Information Operations. October 2001\n• DOD Information Operations Roadmap. October 30, 2003\n• JP 3 - 13 Information Operations. February 13, 2006\nEach of these documents is explored in “China Military Doctrine” on page 171.\nTo further boost the need for Russia to develop its own Information Operations (IO)\ncapability, the authors go on to criticize the U.S. for not supporting United Nations\nefforts to ensure international information security:\nIn 1998, the Russian Federation suggested to the United Nations that it was necessary\nto consolidate the world community’s efforts in order to ensure international information\nsecurity. Since then the General Assembly annually passes the resolution “Developments\nin the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International\nSecurity.” This fact reaffirms the importance of assuring international information se-\ncurity and the UN readiness to study and solve the problem. But progress in this matter\nis extremely slow on account of counterproductive attitudes displayed by the United\nStates.\nFor example, this was the reason why a group of government experts on international\ninformation security that operated under the auspices of the First Committee of the UN\nGeneral Assembly from 2004 to 2005 failed to realize the results of its work. The stum-\nbling block was the Russian Federation’s motion (supported by Brazil, Belarus, China\nand South Africa) on the necessity of studying the military-political component of a threat\nto international information security.\nAs is to be regretted, the U.

For the masterminds of the “flower revolutions” there\nwas an instant spin-off from bringing to power the desirable leaders and governments.\nBut with the passage of time it became clear that political crises in the countries in ques-\ntion and, as a consequence, their economic decline could not be surmounted.\nIronically, Russia waged its own style of information warfare on those very nations,\nincluding Chechnya (in 2002), Kyrgyzstan (in 2005 and 2009), Estonia (in 2007), Lith-\nuania (in 2008), and Georgia (in 2008) in the form of network and government website\nattacks by non-state hackers.\nCreating a legend for a cyber attack\nThere are a few key sections that directly apply to the Kremlin keeping its distance from\nthe activities of its nationalistic hackers during each of the aforementioned examples:\nIn our view, isolating cyber terrorism and cyber crime from the general context of inter-\nnational information security is, in a sense, artificial and unsupported by any real objec-\ntive necessity. This is because the effect of a “cybernetic” weapon does not depend on\nthe motivation of a source of destructive impact, whereas it is primarily motivation that\ndistinguishes acts of cyber terrorism, cyber crime, and military cyber attacks. The rest of\ntheir attributes may be absolutely similar. The practical part of the problem is that the\ntarget of a cyber attack, while in the process of repelling it, will not be informed about\nthe motives guiding its source, and, accordingly, will be unable to qualify what is going\non as a criminal, terrorist or military-political act.

However, it has never been used so clearly or frequently as it\nhas been in this century during times of cyber conflict.\nIn order to understand exactly how the art of misdirection is applied so adeptly to cyber\nevents in Chechnya, Ingushetia, Kyrgyzstan, Estonia, and Georgia, it’s important to\nknow about a very successful practitioner of misdirection, a famous stage magician\nnamed Ralph Hull.\nRalph rose to celebrity in the world of stage magic as a magician’s magician. In other\nwords, his preferred audience consisted of other professionals like himself. He had long\npassed the stage where fooling an audience of “civilians” provided any satisfaction.\nComing up with a trick that baffled other pros, however, was his ultimate goal. He\nsucceeded in that goal with a card trick that he named “The Tuned Deck.”\nThe Russian Federation | 169\nHere is one possible delivery that Ralph’s audience would have heard as he performed\nhis master trick:\nBoys, I have a new trick to show you. It’s called The Tuned Deck.\nThis deck of cards is magically tuned. [Hull holds the deck to his ear and riffles the cards,\nlistening carefully to the buzz of the cards.] By their finely tuned vibrations, I can hear\nand feel the location of any card. Pick a card, any card....\nA member of the audience would pick a card, look at it, and return it to the deck. Hull\nwould then riffle the deck by his ear, and draw the very card the audience member\nselected.\nNo one ever figured out how he did that trick until after his death, when the details of\n“The Tuned Deck” were published. Hull’s secret was shockingly simple. He, like his\ncolleagues, knew multiple ways to perform this trick. Let’s label them A, B, C, D, and\nE. When another magician guessed that Hull was using trick A, Hull would repeat the\ntrick using B. If someone else recognized the trick as B, he would repeat it using trick\nC, and so on. Every time someone thought that they recognized his trick, he would\nimmediately repeat the trick in a slightly different way, and no one expected him to\nrevert back to a method that they had already named. Therefore, in the minds of his\naudience, it must be something new.\nWhat does this have to do with Russian military strategy? Nothing. The misdirection\nwasn’t contained in anything that Hull did on stage. The genius of Ralph Hull wasn’t\nin what he did; it was in what he said. It was in how he named his trick—“The” Tuned\nDeck.\nBy using the word “the,” he created an image of a single trick in the minds of his au-\ndience, when in reality he was performing multiple variations of one trick.\nIn discussing information warfare, both in speeches and in papers, Russian military\nofficials point to a future capability that they are in the process of developing as a\ndefense against U.S. capabilities, which they claim are more advanced and already in\nplace.\nThey define the debate by pointing to what their adversary is developing and therefore\nwhat they must develop to defend their homeland. Having defined what Information\nWarfare is, they will then argue for a treaty regime that limits development of those\ncapabilities. And here is the artfully applied misdirection of the Russian government.\nThe Kremlin will negotiate on military capabilities that they haven’t used, but will not\nnegotiate on their civilian hacker assets that they have used. In fact, the latter is con-\nsidered an internal criminal matter not open to international negotiation at all.\nThis was clearly seen in a story reported in the New York Times on June 27, 2009,\nentitled “US and Russia Differ on a Treaty for Cyberspace.”\n170 | Chapter 11: The Role of Cyber in Military Doctrine"

Col. Timothy Thomas, “Like Adding Wings to the Tiger”\nInformation technology is an area where, unlike industrial capacity or military hard-\nware, no one nation can claim dominance. As a result, information technology and its\nmilitary counterpart, information warfare, holds great appeal for the PRC, which has\ntremendous resources in its population size and the number of their high-quality math\nand science graduates.\nPeople’s Liberation Army (PLA) officers began writing about information warfare at\nabout the same time that the Internet browser became wildly popular: 1993. The in-\nstigating factor was the U.S. display of technology in the first Gulf War, noticed and\nwritten about by General Liu Huaqing, the former vice chairman of the Central Military\nCommission. The U.S victory held special significance for the Chinese because Iraq\nwas using weapons acquired from China and Russia. The resounding defeat of the Iraqi\nmilitary was also a comment on the lack of effectiveness of Chinese hardware against\nan obviously superior force.\nA second wake-up call for the Chinese arrived with the NATO action in Kosovo in\n1999, which resulted in the bombing of the Chinese embassy. Although apologies were\nforthcoming, the action resulted in Chinese hackers attacking official U.S. government\nnetworks, including the U.S. Department of Energy and Interior websites.\nIn April 2001, when a U.S. EP-3 Signals surveillance aircraft collided with a Chinese\nmilitary aircraft, resulting in the death of the Chinese pilot, angry civilian hackers\nlaunched cyber attacks against U.S. networks. These events did not go unnoticed by\nPLA officers, who observed how computer warriors could leverage technological de-\npendencies by a superior force in an effort to gain an asymmetric advantage.\nA recent study uses U.S. joint doctrine as a construct to highlight the differences be-\ntween Chinese and American IW. Kate Farris argues that “the U.S. tends to focus on\nthe CNA aspect of IW, while the Chinese take a more broad perspective, emphasizing\npillars such as PSYOP, Denial, and Deception.” While my selection of Chinese\nliterature persuasively supports this assessment, the current state of Chinese IW is\nChina Military Doctrine | 171\nsimply too immature and not understood well enough to reach any definitive\nconclusion.\nThe inherent problem with a technologically advanced military force is its dependence\non technology. The more complex a network, the more vulnerable it is. Major General\nWang Pufeng wrote in 1995: “There is a question of how to use weakness to defeat\nstrength and how to conduct war against weak enemies in order to use information\nsuperiority to achieve greater victories at a smaller cost.”\nIn 1995, Pufeng, often referred to as the “father of information warfare,” wrote his\ninfluential book The Challenge of Information Warfare, wherein he saw information\nwarfare as a critical factor for China’s future modernization plans:\nIn the final analysis, information warfare is conducted by people. One aspect is to culti-\nvate talent in information science and technology. The development and resolution of\ninformation warfare can be predicted to a great degree in the laboratory. Information\nscience and technology talent are the forerunners of science and technology research.\nToday, Chinese students regularly place at the top of international science and math\nchallenges, far above their peers in the United States. In a 2003 math, science, and\nreading assessment involving 250,000 students from 41 countries, China (Hong Kong)\nranked #1 in science and #3 in math. Many of those students will go on to receive\nadvanced degrees from U.S. universities such as Stanford and MIT, and some may serve\nas officers in the People’s Liberation Army. In 2006, two Chinese universities contrib-\nuted more Ph.D.s to American university graduate programs than any other nation,\nincluding the U.S. (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf08301/).\nThe Chinese government sees information warfare as a true People’s War, meaning\nthat they can recruit technical expertise from their civilian population. Timothy\nThomas wrote about this in his essay “Adding Wings to Tigers”:\nWang Xiaodong, while analyzing a RAND IW document, observed that this study un-\nknowingly outlined a People’s War in the information age.\nEven as to government mobilized troops, the numbers and roles of traditional warriors\nwill be sharply less than those of technical experts in all lines…since thousands of personal\ncomputers can be linked up to perform a common operation, to perform many tasks in\nplace of a large-scale military computer, an IW victory will very likely be determined by\nwhich side can mobilize the most computer experts and part-time fans. That will be a\nreal People’s War.\nIn line with this concept of organizing a civilian cyber militia, there are reports of actual\nIW drills being conducted within Chinese provinces, such as Hubei in 2000. According\nto Xu Jiwu and Xiao Xinmin, in their article “Civil Networks Used in War” (Beijing\nJiefangjun Bao), an IW exercise was held in the city of Ezhou that demonstrated the\nrapid mobilization of civilian networks, such as cable television stations, banking net-\nworks, telecommunications, and other linked systems, to serve as offensive IW units\nin times of war.\n172 | Chapter 11: The Role of Cyber in Military Doctrine\nThis is a further example that China’s political leaders are well aware of their short-\ncomings in traditional warfare and are trying to maximize their assets, civilian and\nmilitary, to gain additional strategic leverage. From their perspective, the key filters for\ndecision making are U.S. military superiority, China’s aging military technology, and\nhow best to prepare for the next military conflict.\nChina views future conflicts in the same way that the U.S. does—as limited engage-\nments rather than total war. To that end, according to Peng and Yao, “what is empha-\nsized most is the combined use of many types of military, political, economic, and\ndiplomatic measures” (Peng Guangqian and Yao Youzhi, eds., The Science of Strat-\negy, Beijing: Military Science Press, 2001).\nThe goal is not to crush an opponent but to make the cost of warfare unacceptable.\nRAND expert James Mulvenon quotes from Lu Daohai’s “Information Operations\"(Lu\nDaohai, Information Operations: Exploring the Seizure of Information Control, Beijing:\nJunshi Yiwen Press, 1999) to make this point:\nComputer warfare targets computers—the core of weapons systems and command,\ncontrol, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems—in order to para-\nlyze the enemy…[and to]…shake war resoluteness, destroy war potential and win the\nupper hand in war.\nThe specific tools of offensive and defensive IW include:\n• Physical destruction\n• Dominance of the electromagnetic spectrum\n• Computer network warfare\n• Psychological manipulation\nInterestingly, these capabilities almost mirror U.S. doctrine on IW, such as the U.S. Air\nForce’s “Six Pillars of IW” and “Joint Vision 2010.” The People’s Liberation Army has\nalso obtained and translated copies of JP3-13.1, “Joint Doctrine for Command and\nControl Warfare,” according to RAND’s James Mulvenon.\nConsequently, PLA strategists use the same terminology as that of the U.S. Armed\nForces: CNO (computer network operations), CNA (computer network attack), CND\n(computer network defense), and CNE (computer network exploitation).\nPriority of these components begins with CNE, since the People’s Republic of China\nbelieves that it is presently the target of computer network attacks by the U.S.\nCNA is believed to be most effective at the very beginning of a conflict and may be used\nfor maximum effect as a preemptive strike. Ideally, if the CNA is disruptive enough, it\nmay end the conflict before it progresses to a full-scale war.\nTargets of interest for a network attack include “hubs and other crucial links in the\nsystem that moves enemy troops as well as the war-making machine, such as harbors,\nairports, means of transportation, battlefield installations, and the communications,\ncommand and control and information systems” according to Lu Linzhi in his article\nChina Military Doctrine | 173"

The report goes on to state that some\nof the cyber attacks may have been successful in gaining control of ATC systems:\nDuring Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, more than 800 cyber incident alerts were issued to the Air\nTraffic Organization (ATO), which is responsible for ATC operations. As of the end of\nFY 2008, over 150 incidents (17 percent) had not been remediated, including critical\nincidents in which hackers may have taken over control of ATO computers.\nAnti-Access Strategies\nAnti-access is a strategy that the PLA has adopted to slow the advance or hamper the\noperational tempo of an opposing force into a theater of operations during time of war.\nThe RAND Corporation released an excellent study on this strategy, authored by James\nMulvenon and David Finkelstein, and it sheds additional light on how the PRC is plan-\nning to fight future wars.\nThey acknowledge up-front that “anti-access” per se is not a formal Chinese military\nstrategy; rather, it is a way of summing up Chinese doctrine that addresses the problem\nof defeating a superior foe. In the case of the United States, that means recognizing U.S.\nreliance on information networks as a significant vulnerability that, if exploited, could\nthrow U.S. plans into chaos and delay or suspend any impending attack.\nAnti-access techniques have a broad range, up to and including triggering an electro-\nmagnetic pulse (EMP) device. Targets could include computer systems based in the\nUnited States or abroad, command and control nodes, space-based intelligence, sur-\nveillance, and reconnaissance and communications assets.\nThe 36 Stratagems\nNo one can say for certain who wrote these 36 martial proverbs; however, some Chinese\nhistorians date them as far back as the Southern Qi dynasty (479–502), which was\nabout 1,000 years after Sun Tzu wrote The Art of War.\nThe 36 stratagems have a darker connotation than The Art of War, focusing solely on\nacts of trickery, mischief, and mayhem—more the province of spies than soldiers. This\nmakes the ancient document an inspiring resource for today’s Chinese non-state\nhackers, who rely on creating ruses to trick unsuspecting Internet users into leaving the\nsafety of their firewalls for dangerous terrain. It’s also interesting to note that, unlike\nRussia, China has never engaged in military action where cyber warfare was a compo-\nnent, allegedly opting instead for acts of cyber espionage:\n174 | Chapter 11: The Role of Cyber in Military Doctrine\nStratagem #3: “Kill with a borrowed knife”\nThis stratagem advises “Attack using the strength of another (in a situation where\nusing one’s own strength is not favourable).”\nThis could just as easily apply to the use of botnets as a means to launch DDOS\nattacks.\nStratagem #8: “Openly repair the gallery roads, but sneak through the passage of\nChencang”\nThis stratagem advises “Deceive the enemy with an obvious approach that will take\na very long time, while surprising him by taking a shortcut and sneak up to him.\nAs the enemy concentrates on the decoy, he will miss you sneaking up to him.”\nUse backdoors or Trojan worms when attacking a network.\nStratagem #10: “Hide a knife behind a smile”\nThis stratagem advises “Charm and ingratiate yourself with your enemy until you\nhave gained his trust. Then move against him.”\nThis could describe phishing schemes or other social engineering attacks.\nStratagem #15: “Lure the tiger out of the mountain”\nThis stratagem advises “Hold out baits to entice the enemy.”\nThis refers to luring an opponent from a position of strength, such as being pro-\ntected by a firewall and updated anti-virus program, to a position of weakness or\nvulnerability. One way to accomplish this is with the adoption of social engineering\ntechniques to get the target to accept a fake email as genuine and open a compro-\nmised attachment or click on an infected link.\nStratagem #17: “Tossing out a brick to get a Jade gem”\nThis stratagem advises “Bait someone by making him believe that he gains some-\nthing and obtain something valuable from him in return.”\nThis could equate to a social engineering technique used to get the target to click\non a link or visit a website where information will be covertly collected without his\nknowledge.\nStratagem #30: “The honey trap”\nThis stratagem advises “Send your enemy beautiful women to cause discord within\nhis camp.”\nIn contemporary computer parlance, this could refer to a honey pot, which lures\nvisitors to a rigged site that collects information about them.\nThe 36 stratagems, like The Art of War, still plays a large role in shaping Beijing’s\nmilitary strategy. Western policy makers should be familiar with both historical docu-\nments if they wish to understand the strategy underpinning the Chinese threat\nlandscape.\nChina Military Doctrine | 175"

    "output": "U.S. Military Doctrine\nThe U.S. Armed Forces have produced more of a paper trail on how cyber warfare is\nto be conducted than any other nation. In fact, as has been mentioned earlier in this\nchapter, the PRC and to some extent the Russian Federation have based their own\ndoctrine on what has been published in the following manuals:\n• DOD Directive No. 3600.1, Information Operations. October 2001\n• DOD Information Operations Roadmap. October 30, 2003\n• JP 3-13 Information Operations. February 13, 2006\nThe question of who controls the U.S. cyber warfare mission has been a hotly contested\nissue over the past several years. The U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy all have their own\ncyber operations, but overall command for conducting CNO has been assigned to the\nU.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the National Security Agency (NSA)\nhas the mission of defending all U.S. military networks.\nThe connection between the NSA and USSTRATCOM occurs at the Joint Functional\nComponent Command (JFCC) level, known as the Joint Functional Component\nCommand—Network Warfare, whose commander is also the director of the NSA.\nWhat follows is the official definition of Network Warfare, as written in Joint Publi-\ncation 3.13:\n[T]he employment of Computer Network Operations (CNO) with the intent of denying\nadversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems, and networks,\nwhile ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems, and net-\nworks. These operations include Computer Network Attack (CNA), Computer Network\nExploitation (CNE), and Computer Network Defense (CND).\nIts important to note that USSTRATCOM is not the sole command authority in this\ncomplex arena. JP3.13 goes on to state that:\nCDRUSSTRATCOM’s specific authority and responsibility to coordinate IO (Informa-\ntion Operations) across AOR and functional boundaries does not diminish the impera-\ntive for the other combatant commanders to coordinate, integrate, plan, execute, and\ndeploy IO. These efforts may be directed at achieving national or military objectives\nincorporated in TSCPs (Theater Security Cooperation Programs), shaping the opera-\ntional environment for potential employment during periods of heightened tensions, or\nin support of specific military operations.\nAlthough terms have been created and defined, a cohesive strategy on cyber warfare\nthat addresses where, when, and how it is to be implemented remains elusive. One\nreason for that is the fact that it is highly classified. Another is that it is still being\ndeveloped.\nThere are numerous problems that confront the military planners who are attempting\nto create this doctrine, not the least of which is attribution and deterrence. How should\nthe U.S. respond to a cyber attack against its networks if it cannot unequivocally prove\n176 | Chapter 11: The Role of Cyber in Military Doctrine\nattribution? How can a deterrence policy be effective if opposing states know that their\ncyber activities can be conducted anonymously?\nAnother problematic area is the longstanding U.S. policy of domain dominance, which\nbasically says that the U.S. will control air, land, sea, and space to such an extent that\nit will have freedom of access to each, as well as the ability to deny access to each to its\nopponents. Cyberspace, as a global electronic medium, cannot be dominated or con-\ntrolled by any one nation.\nThen there is the expectation that rules of engagement (ROEs) will apply to cyber\nwarfare. Some of the issues surrounding ROEs were made clear in a recent National\nAcademy of Sciences report titled “Technology, Policy, Law and Ethics Regarding U.S.\nAcquisition and Use of Cyber Attack Capabilities”:\nWhen to execute a cyber attack\nWhat are the circumstances under which a cyber attack might be authorized?\nScope of a cyber attack\nWhat are the entities that may be targeted?\nDuration of a cyber attack\nHow long should a cyber attack last?\nNotifications\nWho must be informed if a cyber attack is conducted?\nAuthority for exceptions\nWhat level of authority is needed to grant an exception for standing ROEs?\nThe Obama Administration will be making significant headway in these areas through\n2012, but it is too early to expect any answers to these hard challenges to be forthcoming\nbefore the publication of this book.\nChina Military Doctrine | 177"

He graciously\nagreed, and I think the book is richer for it.\nThe Challenge We Face\nThe U.S. currently faces the daunting challenge of identifying the actors responsible\nfor launching politically motivated cyber attacks. According to Defense Secretary Rob-\nert Gates, the United States is “under cyber attack virtually all the time, every day.” It\nis estimated that more than 140 countries currently field cyber warfare capabilities.\nAdditionally, sophisticated adversaries can route attacks through proxies and obfuscate\ntheir identities. These facts combine to make attribution of cyber attacks a difficult\nchallenge.\nDuring the Cold War, none of these challenges existed. Attacks between the United\nStates and rival powers were few and far between. The pool of nuclear powers was\nlimited to an exclusive club. Additionally, it was more difficult to route a nuclear attack\nthrough a proxy.\nThe heightened ability to detect and identify the source of nuclear or missile attack\nincreased stability during the Cold War. Many policy makers fear that the current in-\nability to quickly and accurately identify the source of a cyber attack leads to instability\nand increases the chances that cyber attacks will be carried out. In order to improve its\ndefensive posture, the United States must develop a cyber attack early warning system.\n179"

Instead, a\nfresh analytical framework is needed. This framework will help limit the pool of pos-\nsible aggressors and allow policy makers to marry whatever technical evidence can be\ngathered during a cyber attack with a list of possible aggressors. Ideally, the output of\nthis analysis will be the identification of the actor responsible for a cyber attack.\nMore importantly, this framework should allow defenders to predict rather than react\nto the occurrence of politically motivated attacks. The current cyber early warning\nsystems that track scans and probes cannot provide the same predictive capability as\nthe proposed model. The current cyber early warning system does not sort signals from\nnoise and instead reports on all perceived malicious scans and probes. The model dis-\ncussed in the following section will allow defenders to predict when a cyber attack will\noccur and which actors are likely to initiate the attack.\nBuilding an Analytical Framework for Cyber Early Warning\nA careful review of numerous politically motivated cyber attacks reveals a consistent\npattern in how they are organized and executed. Previous attacks, whether executed\nby non-state or state actors, appear to be grounded in latent political tensions between\nadversaries. As these latent tensions heat up, cyber aggressors tend to carry out cyber\nreconnaissance probes in an apparent effort to prepare for future attacks. Latent ten-\nsions require some type of initiating event that can be used to mobilize cyber patriots\ninto a cyber militia. The cyber militia can be used to carry out brute-force attacks, while\nmore elite hackers can use the intelligence gathered from prior cyber reconnaissance\nprobes to execute more sophisticated attacks (Figure 12-1).\nFigure 12-1. Stages of a politically motivated cyber attack\nLatent tensions\nAlthough still dominated by nation-states, today’s international political system fea-\ntures a number of players. Non-state actors—such as terrorist groups, international\norganizations, and in some cases ideologically affiliated flash mobs—have exercised\nsome measure of geopolitical influence.\n180 | Chapter 12: A Cyber Early Warning Model"

The model must be equally useful\nin predicting a cyber attack originating from either a state or non-state actor against\neither a state or a non-state actor.\nLatent tensions exist in the background between any number of actors in the interna-\ntional political system. For example, historical animosity between Muslims and the\nstate of Israel have resulted in a steady state of politically motivated attacks—both in\nthe physical world and in cyberspace. Under the right conditions, these latent tensions\ncan explode into full-fledged warfare.\nCyber reconnaissance\nAgainst this simmering backdrop, tensions can at times boil over. However, prior to\nthe initiation of hostilities in cyberspace, adversaries are likely to conduct probes of\neach other’s infrastructure. The rationale for conducting cyber reconnaissance is no\ndifferent than the rationale for conducting reconnaissance in the physical world. Ad-\nversaries conduct cyber reconnaissance in an effort to discover vulnerabilities in their\nrival’s infrastructure that can be exploited if and when tensions erupt into hostilities.\nCyber reconnaissance also allows adversaries to develop effective tools specifically de-\nsigned to attack an enemy’s infrastructure.\nDuring the August 2008 war between Russia and Georgia in the disputed region of\nSouth Ossetia, a parallel conflict occurred in cyberspace. Investigations by Project Grey\nGoose researchers found that pro-Russian hackers conducted in-depth cyber recon-\nnaissance prior to the initiation of hostilities on August 8, 2008. Specifically, Georgian\nwebsites were probed for vulnerabilities. The U.S. Cyber Consequence Unit (USCCU)\nlater confirmed these findings. In a report on the cyber conflict in Georgia, the USCCU\nwrote:\n[W]hen the cyber attacks began, they did not involve any reconnaissance or mapping\nstage, but jumped directly to the sort of packets that were best suited to jamming the\nwebsites under attack. This indicates that the necessary reconnaissance and the writing\nof attack scripts had to have been done in advance. Many of the actions the attackers\ncarried out, such as registering new domain names and putting up new websites, were\naccomplished so quickly that all of the steps had to have been prepared earlier.\nInitiating event\nInitiating events are any events that cause latent tensions to boil over and trigger po-\nlitically motivated attacks. Just as the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand put coun-\ntries aligned with Austria-Hungary onto a collision course with countries aligned with\nSerbia and eventually led to World War I, similar initiating events have led to the out-\nbreak of politically motivated cyber attacks.\nThe 2007 Cyber War against Estonian websites took place against the backdrop of\nsimmering tensions between Estonia and Russia.

Following this annexation the Soviet Union initiated a\ncrackdown, arresting more than 8,000 Estonian citizens and executing an additional\n2,000 citizens.\nThe proximate cause for the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government’s\ndecision to relocate a Soviet Red Army war memorial from central Tallinn, the Estonian\ncapital city. Many Estonians see the memorial as a stark reminder of the former Soviet\nUnion’s “occupation” of Estonia, whereas many Russians view the statue as a memorial\nto the Red Army’s sacrifices in its liberation of Estonia from Nazi Germany.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the statue’s relocation, angry youths with links to the\nKremlin rioted around the Estonian Embassy in Moscow. Russian officials also insisted\nthat the statue be returned to its original location, and in an unprecedented move de-\nmanded that the current Estonian government resign. These riots in the physical world\nwere paralleled by a corresponding campaign of digital violence.\nCyber mobilization\nAccording to Adam Elkus, cyber mobilization “is a process of massing force\nagainst decisive points” (http://www.groupintel.com/2009/02/13/the-rise-of-cyber-mobi\nlization/). The aggrieved actor uses the initiating event to incite patriotic hackers into\naction.\nExamples of cyber mobilization abound. Chinese patriotic hackers have traditionally\nrallied support to their cause via various online message boards and chat rooms. In\n2008, Chinese citizens created the Anti-CNN web forum in response to “the lies and\ndistortions of facts from the Western media.” Chinese citizens and patriotic hackers\nbelieved the Western media unfairly criticized China’s treatment of Tibetan people.\nAlthough the creation of the Anti-CNN forum and the mobilization of Chinese patriotic\nhackers against Western media companies did not result in any successful high-profile\nattacks against Western media websites, the Anti-CNN forum was able to mobilize a\nnumber of Chinese citizens in its efforts to counter perceived biases in Western media\ncoverage. In April 2008, shortly after the web forum launched, the website claimed to\nreceive 500,000 visits per day.\nCyber attack\nPolitically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication from small-scale denial of\nservice attacks to well-organized and stealthy espionage attacks. The sophistication of\na cyber attack is dependent on the skill of attackers and the amount of reconnaissance\nperformed prior to the attack. A sophisticated attacker aided with intelligence gathered\nfrom reconnaissance can execute a devastating attack, whereas an unsophisticated at-\ntacker without any intelligence on its targets will be relegated to simple brute-force\nattacks.\n182 | Chapter 12: A Cyber Early Warning Model"

To fully test the utility of this model, it is important to study\nprevious cyber wars between nation-states, cyber attacks by nation-states against non-\nstate actors, and cyber attacks by non-state actors against nation-states.\nCase study: Cyber attacks against Georgia\nLatent political tensions between Russia and Georgia existed prior to the breakup of\nthe Soviet Union. In the late 1980s, Georgian opposition leaders pressed for independ-\nence from the Soviet Union. In 1989, Abkhaz nationalists demanded the creation of a\nseparate Soviet republic. This demand led to conflicts between ethnic Georgians living\nin Abkhaz and Abkhaz nationalists supported by the Soviet Union.\nAfter the breakup of the Soviet Union, tensions in Abkhaz continued to rise. In 1992,\nAbkhaz nationalists continued to press for independence, and militants attacked gov-\nernment buildings in Sukhumi. In response, Georgian police and National Guard units\nwere sent into Abkhaz to regain control. The tensions between Georgia and Russia over\nAbkhaz have continued to the present day and were largely responsible for the outbreak\nof conflict in the South Ossetia region in 2008.\nThe outbreak of conflict in South Ossetia in 2008 was paralleled by the outbreak of\ncyber attacks against Georgian government websites (Figure 12-2). Pro-Russian hackers\npromoted attacking Georgian websites and coordinated their actions via a network of\nhacking websites frequented by Russian cyber criminals and hackers. Additionally,\nsuspected pro-Russian hackers launched StopGeorgia.ru, a website dedicated to re-\ncruiting sympathetic hackers to the Russian cyber militia. StopGeorgia.ru provided\neager sympathizers with a list of Georgia websites to attack, as well as instructions on\nhow to launch various kinds of cyber attacks. Georgian websites were either defaced\nwith anti-Georgian propaganda (Figure 12-3) or were knocked offline with distributed\ndenial of service (DDoS) attacks.\nFigure 12-2. Stages of cyber attacks on Georgian websites\nCase study: GhostNet cyber espionage\nAccording to the Information Warfare Monitor’s “Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a\nCyber Espionage Network” report, “accusations of Chinese cyber war being waged\nagainst the Tibetan community have been commonplace for the last several years. The\nThe Challenge We Face | 183\nFigure 12-3.

The cyber espionage network was composed of “at least 1,295 computers\nin 103 countries, of which close to 30% can be considered high-value diplomatic, po-\nlitical, economic, and military targets.” Further, the Information Warfare Monitor\nfound “documented evidence of GhostNet penetration of computer systems containing\nsensitive and secret information at the private offices of the Dalai Lama and other\nTibetan targets.”\nThe cyber espionage attacks against the Tibetan community were carried against the\nbackdrop of political tensions between the Chinese government and the Tibetan com-\nmunity (Figure 12-4). Tensions between these two groups escalated prior to the 2008\nBeijing Summer Olympics. The Chinese government was increasingly concerned that\npro-Tibetan independence groups planned to use the Summer Olympics as a platform\nto protest and attract increased international attention. Although cyber espionage\nattacks occurred well before the Chinese government became concerned about the\npossibility of Tibetan protests during the Beijing Games, it is likely that the increased\ntension between the Chinese and the Tibetans during this time period was a driver of\nincreased cyber espionage attacks against the Tibetan community. It is unclear who\ncarried these attacks, but it is likely that the Chinese government received the infor-\nmation collected from these efforts.\n184 | Chapter 12: A Cyber Early Warning Model"

    "output": "Figure 12-4. Stages of Chinese cyber espionage attacks on pro-Tibetan targets\nThe Chinese hacker community communicates primarily through a series of web fo-\nrums and chat rooms. Hacking attacks are promoted on these websites, and often calls\nto action against specific targets are posted. In the case of the GhostNet attacks, rallying\nthe Chinese cyber militia against specific targets would have been counterproductive\ndue to the semi-public nature of these websites. If the targets of cyber espionage attacks\nare openly posted, it is more likely that the target will be informed of its status as a\ntarget and therefore increase its defensive posture. Instead of following the Russian\ncyber militia’s example of openly mobilizing sympathetic hackers for attacks against\nGeorgian targets via the StopGeorgia.ru forum, the Chinese militia was mobilized for\nthe cyber espionage campaign against the Tibetan community through a more nuanced\napproach.\nThis more nuanced approach included general discussion about enemies of the Chinese\npeople. Just as the Chinese cyber militia used the Anti-CNN website to rail against the\nperceived bias of the Western media, discussions on various Chinese hacker and other\nnationalist websites included discussions about the need to reign in the Tibetan com-\nmunity. No direct discussion about targeting specific Tibetan organizations was re-\nquired. Instead, the general discussion regarding the increasingly restive Tibetan com-\nmunity likely was enough to motivate members of the Chinese cyber militia to execute\ncyber espionage attacks such as the example shown in Figure 12-5.\nCase study: Cyber attacks against Denmark\nOn September 30, 2005 the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published a series of\ncartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed. The newspaper claimed it published these\ncartoons as an attempt to contribute to the ongoing debate about self-censorship and\nthe ability to criticize Islam.\nDanish Muslim organizations sternly objected to the publication of the cartoons and\nheld public protests to voice their displeasure. Protests soon spread around the world.\nThe following February, protest against the publication of the cartoons continued and\na corresponding campaign of website defacements and denial of service attacks were\nlaunched.\nThe Challenge We Face | 185\nFigure 12-5. Virus-laden PowerPoint used to infect members of the Tibetan community (image\ncourtesy of F-Secure)\nAccording to Zone-H, a European consortium of IT security professionals that tracks\ncyber crime, over 600 Danish websites have been attacked. A majority of these attacks\nwere website defacements; however, denial of service attacks against the Jyllands-\nPosten newspaper website (http://www.jp.dk) were also executed.\nThe Prophet Mohammed cartoon controversy occurred against the backdrop of sim-\nmering tensions between European countries and Muslims (Figure 12-6). In the case\nof these attacks, very little cyber reconnaissance was required. Attackers understood\nthat websites in the .dk domain were to be targeted. Many of the website defacements\nappear to have been carried out with automated scripts designed to exploit known\nvulnerabilities in production web server software.\nFigure 12-6.

    "output": "Although the cyber attacks occurred many months after the publication of the cartoons,\nit is clear that these cartoons were used as the initiating event to rally Muslim and other\nsympathetic hackers to the cause of attacking Danish websites. These defacement and\ndenial of service attacks were coordinated through a network of jihadist websites. De-\nfaced sites also included propaganda designed in part to promote further attacks against\nDanish websites. Additionally, individuals promoting the boycott of Danish goods\nlaunched no4Denmark.com. Although this particular website was not used to organize\nthe Muslim cyber militia, it certainly drew attention to their cause.\nLessons Learned\nLatent tensions and cyber reconnaissance are important stages in well-organized po-\nlitically motivated cyber attacks, but they do not appear to be necessary. The low-cost\nand low-risk nature of cyber warfare allows an attacker to quickly coordinate an attack\nagainst an adversary. Latent tensions are not necessary as long as an initiating event\ncapable of rallying a cyber militia to action occurs. A cyber militia can conduct an\nunsophisticated brute-force denial of service attack without conducting the type of\nextensive cyber reconnaissance necessary to execute a sophisticated cyber attack. The\nonly reconnaissance required to conduct an unsophisticated brute-force denial of serv-\nice attack is the simple list of targeted websites. However, these types of attacks are\neasier to defend against and therefore should not preoccupy U.S. policy makers.\nInstead, policy makers should focus on those cyber attacks executed by adversaries\nwith preexisting grievances against the United States. These latent political tensions\nencourage an attacker’s cyber militia to conduct detailed cyber reconnaissance as well\nas rally sophisticated hackers to join the attacker’s cyber militia.\nThis model could also be used to distinguish between cyber crime attacks and politically\nmotivated attacks. Sophisticated politically motivated cyber attacks will follow the 5-\nstage model set forth earlier in this chapter: latent tensions, cyber reconnaissance,\ninitiating events, cyber mobilization, and cyber attack. Unsophisticated politically mo-\ntivated cyber attacks will follow a truncated 3-stage model of initiating event, cyber\nmobilization, and cyber attack.\nIn contrast, cyber crime attacks are more likely to follow an altered 2-stage model: cyber\nreconnaissance and cyber attack. If no latent tensions exist between adversaries, no\nobvious initiating event occurs, and no mobilization of cyber militia is detected, then\ncriminal organizations motivated by financial gain are likely responsible for the attacks\nin question.\nThe true value of this model is two-fold. From a proactive perspective, this model shows\nus that well-organized and sophisticated politically motivated cyber attacks are likely\nto involve some public or semipublic form of cyber mobilization. Cyber militias are\nlikely to rally other sympathetic hackers to their cause via online chat rooms and mes-\nsage boards. These calls to arms are typically announced via public or semipublic\nchannels because cyber militias are typically interested in rallying a large number of\nThe Challenge We Face | 187"

    "output": "hackers to their cause. As more hackers join the cyber militia, the power of the militia\nincreases in terms of its ability to generate more bandwidth during a distributed denial\nof service attack. Additionally, as more hackers join a cyber militia, more noise is gen-\nerated and defenders will have a harder time detecting truly malicious attacks from the\nmore benign brute-force denial of service attacks. Fortunately for the defenders, as\ncyber militias attempt to rally more hackers to their cause, their public or semipublic\ncommunications can be intercepted. A proactive defender can intercept a cyber militia’s\ncall to arms and construct an informed defensive posture.\nFrom a reactive perspective, use of this model could aid in assigning attribution for a\ncyber attack. As discussed, a sophisticated politically motivated cyber attack is likely\nto occur against the backdrop of latent political tensions between adversaries. As actors\nwithin the international arena are likely to have adversarial relations with only a limited\nnumber of actors, that pool of possible attackers is limited. The pool of possible at-\ntackers is further limited to those actors that have previously demonstrated both the\ncapability and intent to conduct sophisticated cyber attacks.\nDefense Readiness Condition for Cyberspace\nThe proposed 5-stage framework of politically motivated cyber attacks can be used to\ncreate a Defense Readiness Condition (DEFCON) for cyberspace. The existing\nDEFCON scale, from 5 to 1, measures the readiness level of the United States Armed\nForces. DEFCON 5 represents normal peacetime military readiness, whereas DEFCON\n1 represents maximum readiness and is reserved for imminent or ongoing attacks\nagainst the U.S.\nThe 5-stage model also could be used to inform the United State’s DEFCON rating for\ncyberspace. Cyber DEFCON 5 exists during normal conditions with latent political\ntensions between the United States and a range of adversaries.\nCyber DEFCON 4 could be activated when cyber reconnaissance is detected against\nthe backdrop of existing latent political tensions between the United States and its\nadversaries. For example, when probes are detected from Russia, China, or other ad-\nversaries with a demonstrated cyber warfare capability and a declared intention,\nDEFCON 4 should be activated.\nCyber DEFCON 3 could be activated in the aftermath of cyber reconnaissance and an\ninitiating event. For example, in the aftermath of the U.S.-China spy plane incident in\n2001, when a U.S. Navy EP-3 surveillance aircraft collided with a People’s Liberation\nArmy fighter plane. This incident sparked a cyber war between U.S. and Chinese hack-\ners, during which a number of U.S. and Chinese websites were defaced or knocked\noffline.\nCyber DEFCON 2 could be activated after an initiating event occurs and the mobili-\nzation of enemy cyber militias is detected. In the aftermath of the invasion of South\nOssetia, pro-Russian hackers launched the StopGeorgia.ru website in order to mobilize\n188 | Chapter 12: A Cyber Early Warning Model\na pro-Russian cyber militia. As previously discussed, cyber mobilization typically oc-\ncurs in semipublic forums because militia organizers desire to attract as many sympa-\nthetic hackers as possible. The more public the call to arms, the greater the chance the\nmilitia will recruit new members and increase in size. Fortunately, the more public the\ncall to arms, the greater the likelihood that the defender will detect the mobilization of\nthe enemy’s cyber militia. When these types of activities are detected, cyber DEFCON\n2 should be activated.\nCyber DEFCON 1 should be activated when attacks appear imminent or are ongoing.\nIt is apparent that cyber attacks will be used either in parallel with armed attacks or as\nthe sole means of attack between adversaries. Therefore, it is important to understand\nhow attacks are planned, organized, and executed.\nUse of this model may improve the United States’s ability to predict and defend against\nfuture politically motivated cyber attacks. It is therefore important that this 5-stage\nmodel be discussed, tested, and altered as necessary.\nThe Challenge We Face | 189"

A state or non-state hacker attacks U.S. critical infrastructures\nand Department of Defense networks at will and without fear of detection or attribu-\ntion. He is able to do this from behind the protection of two very valuable “hostages”\nor, more precisely, “sacred cows” that U.S. government officials, including the Con-\ngress, are loathe to change—using Microsoft Windows and regulating a segment of\nprivate industry:\nHostage 1\nThe pervasive use of the Microsoft Windows operating system (OS) throughout\nthe federal government but particularly within the Department of Defense, the\nintelligence community, and privately owned critical networks controlling the\npower, water, transportation, and communication networks\nHostage 2\nThe uninterrupted, sustained economic growth of U.S. Internet service providers,\ndata centers, and domain name registrars who profit by selling services to criminal\norganizations and nationalistic hackers that prefer the reliability and speed of U.S.\nnetworks to the ones found in their own countries\nIn this case, the best solution, bar none, is to metaphorically “shoot the hostage,” thus\ndenying an adversary both of his weapons (1) malware configured for the Windows\nOS and (2) his attack platform—the most reliable Internet services companies in the\nworld.\nShoot the first hostage by switching from Microsoft Windows to Red Hat Linux for all\nof the networks suffering high daily-intrusion rates. Red Hat Linux is a proven secure\nOS with less than 90% of the bugs found per 1,000 lines of code than in Windows.\nMany decision makers don’t know that it is the most certified operating system in the\nworld, and it’s already in use by some of the U.S. government’s most secretive agencies.\nComputers are changed out every three to four years on average anyway, so the mon-\netary pain is probably not as great as it might seem.

Linux certainly has its vulnerabil-\nities, but the math speaks for itself. Shoot Windows and eliminate the majority of the\nmalware threat with one stroke.\nShoot the second hostage by cracking down on U.S. companies that provide Internet\nservices to individuals and companies who engage in illegal activities, provide false\nWHOIS information, and other indicators that they are potential platforms for cyber\nattacks.\n192 | Chapter 13: Advice for Policy Makers from the Field\nFigure 13-1.

    "output": "The United States Should Use Active Defenses to Defend Its\nCritical Information Systems\nBy Lieutenant Commander Matthew J. Sklerov*\nCyberspace is a growing front in 21st-century warfare. Today, states rely on the Internet\nas a cornerstone of commerce, communication, emergency services, energy production\nand distribution, mass transit, military defenses, and countless other critical state sec-\ntors. In effect, the Internet has become the nervous system of modern society.\nUnfortunately, reliance on the Internet is a two-edged sword. While it provides tre-\nmendous benefits to states, it also opens them up to attack from state and non-state\nactors. Given the ease with which anyone can acquire the tools necessary to conduct a\ncyber attack, anonymously and from afar, cyber attacks provide the enemies of a state\nwith an ideal tool to wage asymmetric warfare against it. Thus, it should come as no\nsurprise that states and terrorists are increasingly turning to cyber attacks to wage war\nagainst their enemies.\nToday, the United States treats cyber attacks as a criminal matter and has foregone\nusing active defenses to protect its critical information systems. This is a mistake. The\ngovernment needs to modernize its approach to cyber attacks in order to adequately\nprotect U.S. critical information systems. Unless policy makers change course, the\nUnited States will continue to be at greater risk of a catastrophic cyber attack than need\nbe the case.\nModernizing the U.S. approach to cyber attacks requires major changes to the way the\nfederal government currently does business.\nFirst and foremost, the United States needs to start using active defenses to protect its\ncritical information systems. This will better protect these systems, serve as a deterrent\nto attackers, and provide an impetus for other states to crack down on their hackers.\nSecond, the United States needs to devote significantly more resources and personnel\nto its cyber warfare forces. Creating the preeminent cyber warfare force is an absolute\nimperative in order to secure U.S. critical infrastructure against cyber attacks, and to\nprevent the Internet from becoming the Achilles’ heel of the United States in the 21st\ncentury.\nFurthermore, a large, expertly trained cyber warfare force should be a prerequisite to\nactually using active defenses, since using active defenses on the national scale without\nproperly trained personnel could easily lead to unjustified damage against illegitimate\ntargets.\n* The views expressed here are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of the Department\nof Defense.\n194 | Chapter 13: Advice for Policy Makers from the Field\nThe decision to use active defenses will, no doubt, create a lot of controversy, as would\nany major change to state practice. However, there is sound legal justification to use\nthem, as long as their use is limited to attacks originating from sanctuary states, as laid\nout in Chapter 4. Limiting active defenses to attacks originating from sanctuary states\nstill leaves states vulnerable to cyber attacks from rogue elements of cooperating states,\nbut this change to state practice significantly improves U.S. cyber defenses without\nrunning afoul of international law.\nFurthermore, under a paradigm where active defenses are authorized against sanctuary\nstates, the United States could feel comfortable knowing that either cyber attacks would\nbe defended against with the best computer defenses available or that when computer\ndefenses were limited to passive defenses alone, the state of origin would fully cooperate\nto hunt down and prosecute the attackers.\nIn adopting this approach, the United States needs to use its diplomatic influence to\nemphasize states’ duty to prevent cyber attacks, defined as passing stringent criminal\nlaws, conducting vigorous law enforcement investigations, prosecuting attackers, and,\nduring the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim-states of cyber\nattacks. Using U.S. influence to emphasize this duty, combined with the threat that the\nUnited States will respond to cyber attacks with active defenses when states violate this\nduty, should help coerce sanctuary states into taking action against their hackers. This\nis an essential step toward both a global culture of cyber security and eliminating the\nthreat of cyber attacks from non-state actors.\nAdmittedly, the decision to use active defenses is not without complications. Techno-\nlogical limitations will still make it difficult to detect, assess, and trace cyber attacks.\nAs a result, frontline forces will run into trouble trying to factually assess attacks and,\ngiven the speed with which cyber attacks execute, will frequently be forced to make\ndecisions with imperfect information. (These difficulties are assessed in greater detail\nin Chapter 4.) Thus it is imperative for the United States to invest the capital necessary\nto ensure that its cyber warfare forces are able to overcome these difficulties. Otherwise,\npoor decisions are likely to be made, and active defenses might accidentally be directed\nagainst allied states or used before the legal thresholds for their use are crossed.\nAt a time when cyber attacks threaten global security and states are scrambling to find\nways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason to shield sanctuary states from\nthe lawful use of active defenses, and every reason to enhance U.S. defenses to cyber\nattacks by using them. Selectively targeting sanctuary states with active defenses will\nnot only better protect the United States from cyber attacks but should also push other\nstates to take cyber attacks seriously as a criminal matter because no state wants another\nstate acting within its borders, even electronically.\nUsing force against other states may sound like a harsh measure, but states that wish\nto avoid being the targets of active defenses can easily do so; all they must do is fulfill\ntheir duty to prevent cyber attacks.\nThe United States Should Use Active Defenses to Defend Its Critical Information Systems | 195"

    "input": "Whole-of-Nation Cyber Security",
    "output": "Whole-of-Nation Cyber Security\nBy Alexander Klimburg\nThe general public is often wholly unaware of how much of what we commonly call\n“security” depends on the work of informal groups and volunteer networks. For a while\nit seemed that Western governments had generally gotten the message: when most of\nyour critical infrastructure is in private hands, it is natural that new forms of private-\npublic partnerships need to be created to be able to work on critical infrastructure\nprotection. Organizations such as the U.S. ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis\nCenter) and the UK WARP (Warning, Advice, and Reporting Point) are examples of\nthis thinking. Unfortunately, most governments have a hard time moving beyond the\n“two society” (government and business) model. In an age where even the “managing”\nbodies of the Internet (such as ICANN) do not belong to either of these groups but\ninstead are really part of the “third society”—i.e., the civil society—this is a critical,\nand potentially fatal, omission. From groups of coders working on open source projects\nto the investigative journalism capability of blogs, the breadth of the involvement of\nthe civil society and non-state actors in cyber security is wide and growing. But what\nare these groups, exactly?\nThe variety of these groups is as wide as the Internet itself, and these groups also interact\ndirectly with the harder side of cyber security. Non-government forces of various de-\nscriptions have attacked countries on their own (e.g., Estonia, Lithuania) and defended\nthem, helped wage a cyber war (e.g., Georgia), and sought to uncover government\ncomplicity in them. One can even argue that most of the cyber terror and cyber war\nactivity seen over the last decade can be ascribed to various non-state actors. A recent\nU.S. Congressional inquiry heard that the great majority of the Chinese attacks against\nthe U.S. were probably being done by young volunteer programmers whose connection\nwith the security services was probably more accidental then anything else. Indeed, if\none looks at the sum total of cyber security–relevant behavior, from software and patch\ndevelopment on the technical side to the freelance journalism and general activism on\nthe political side (and with the “script kiddie patriot hackers” somewhere in between),\nit indeed seems that most “cyber security” work is done by members of the third society,\nwith business following close behind—and government bringing up the rear.\nDo these groups really have anything in common? After all, it is questionable whether\nheavily instrumentalized civilian hacker groups in China and Russia really qualify as\nrepresentatives of a “civil society.” Should they really be compared to, say, a Linux\ndevelopers’ group or an INFOSEC blog network? Aren’t these “patriot hackers” just\nan update of the age-old paradigm of the citizen militia and the flag-burning rent-a-\nmob, but with broadband?\nAlthough the militia model can to a limited extent be applied to some of the Russian\nand Chinese groups (indeed, the Russians actively talk of the need to maintain an\n“information society” for their national security, and the Chinese have recruited an\n“information operations militia”), the model just does not hold for the many groups\nWhole-of-Nation Cyber Security | 199\nrooted in liberal democratic societies. This is particularly evident when examining non-\ntechnical (i.e., not “White” or “Grey” hacker) groups and their activities. They are\nincreasingly able to provide critical input into one of the most difficult aspects of any\nwide-scale cyber attack, namely attacker attribution.\nIdentifying the true actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task. Attrib-\nuting attacks to individual actors is traditionally seen as being the acid test to determine\nwhether an attack is rated as an act of cyber war or an act of cyber terrorism (or even\n“cyber hooliganism”). Given these rather high standards, governments have been no-\ntoriously reluctant to point fingers. After all, there was no evidence that could be shared\npublicly. On the surface it seemed that the authoritarian governments of Russia and\nChina had found the ultimate plausible-deniability foil with which to jab the West:\nrather then personally engaging in hostile cyber attacks, these governments could sim-\nply refer to the activities of their “engaged and active civil society” and wash their hands\nof the affair.\nThe advent of engaged civil society groups has changed this. Since 2005, these groups\nhave published a flood of reports that have examined suspicious cyber behavior, mostly\noriginating in Russia and China. The Georgian cyber attacks were particularly inter-\nesting, as the timing seemed to indicate at least some level of coordination between the\nRussian military’s kinetic attacks and the assault on Georgian servers. Reports such as\nthose generated by Project Grey Goose helped to show that although the information\nof Russian government complicity in the cyber assault on Georgia was far from con-\nclusive, there was much circumstantial evidence. For the reports, and the Western\nmedia that depended on them, this was sufficient. Unlike governments, for the public,\n“perfect” was clearly the enemy of the good.\nThe information in these reports is not good enough for cruise missiles, but it certainly\nis good enough for CNN. The barrage of reports that imply direct Russian government\ninvolvement has been widely reported in Western media. The increase of embarrassing\nquestions posed to the Kremlin is probably a direct result of this media attention. At a\ncyber security conference at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe\n(OSCE) in 2008, an American official privately remarked to me that the incessant ac-\ncusations repeated in the media were leading the Kremlin to reduce its support of var-\nious groups, such as the pro-Putin Nashi, whose members have been implicated in\ncyber attacks. He directly credited the work of the civil society groups—including Grey\nGoose—in bringing this about. Sunlight as a disinfectant seems to work across borders\nas well.\nIt therefore appears that the best defense against a compromised or captive civil society\nis a free one. I have taken to referring to these “free” groups as security trust networks\n(STNs), and there are considerable differences between these groups and the ones that\nthey often seem to work in direct opposition to:\n• An STN is independent and not beholden to any agency of government or private\nbusiness. The state does not exert direct control over them, and cannot (easily)\n200 | Chapter 13: Advice for Policy Makers from the Field\nshut it down. This does not mean that the STN does not support a government; it\njust means that it chooses when and if to do so.\n• An STN is defined not only by the trust within the network itself but also the trust\nthat other networks bring to it. For instance, an STN will often be seen as a credible\npartner for government and law enforcement, despite having no formal structure\nor pedigree.\n• STNs are defined by ethics: besides (generally) operating within the remits of the\nlaw, its members share a common moral code, explicit or implicit, based on “doing\nthe right thing.” The shared moral mission of the STN is its official raison d’être.\nWestern governments often depend on these STNs much more than they realize. This\nis especially true for the technical experts, who invest a large amount of labor that\nmostly goes unnoticed, but also for the investigative STNs, such as Grey Goose, that\ncertainly have helped frame the public debate.\nSo is it possible for a government to help create these STNs? The question is not as\nbizarre as it might seem. Russia has actively followed this course since at least 2000\n(the publication date of its “Information Security Doctrine”) and is trying to “build a\ninformation society.” Although Alexis de Tocqueville might well wince at the idea of\na government building a civil society, there is indeed much that truly democratic gov-\nernments can do to encourage the formation of such groups and work together with\nthem:\nOpenness\nAllowing government employees and security professionals to engage in social\nmedia (and blogging in particular) has been a contentious issue in the U.S. for years.\nA number of problems do arise from this type of behavior, quite a few of them\nsecurity-related. Nonetheless, the possible benefits (such as the creation of an STN)\ncan easily outweigh the real damage potential. The U.S. is far ahead here compared\nto most European governments, which still forbid this type of action.\nCommunication\nOrganized outreach programs are vital. In the purely technical and purely diplo-\nmatic circles, this is an established practice, but it should extend to other security\nareas as well. Again the U.S. has gone far in this area, with experiments with\ncrowdsourcing intelligence and the like, but Australia and the UK also have very\nengaging approaches.\nAccessibility\nBeing available for queries outside of the normal process is an important sign of\ntruly open government. This means not only working across government (“Whole\nof Government”) but also being prepared to collaborate and communicate with\nnon-government organizations (“Whole of Nation”). Although everyone needs to\nimprove here, the U.S. has an especially long way to go.\nWhole-of-Nation Cyber Security | 201\nTransparency\nThis is often misunderstood as demanding transparency on the inner workings of\ngovernment. Instead, it is the government’s goals that should be transparent—\nwhich they should continuously be forced to defend—in part for the STNs that\nmight be able to indicate where the government is, once again, working against its\nown goals. The U.S. does well here, although some European countries, such as\nthe UK, Holland, and Sweden, are at least as transparent.\nUnderstanding ambiguity\nThis is always an important skill, and it is important that individual civil servants\nunderstand the different roles people can occupy, and to what extent these roles\nfacilitate or hinder closer cooperation. This is particularly important when some-\none’s motivation is balanced between altruistic volunteerism and commercial\nopportunity-seeking. A mixed experience for the U.S. (the “revolving door”), but\nthe UK traditionally has been a past master at this art.\nTrust\nTrust makes security stronger, and it needs to work on every level. Security clear-\nances are for the most part unreconstructed affairs dating back to the dawn of the\nCold War. In the end, often they don’t mean much—whether you get information\nwill still depend on the level of trust available. Obviously certain basic background\nchecks are logical and should be done if any real security info is going to be passed\nonto outsiders; however, these are a couple of levels below real security clearances\nand can stay that way. Trusting one’s own judgment is much more important. The\nU.S. can learn much about this from some European countries, especially the UK.\nIt is not an exaggeration to claim that an independent, vibrant, and engaged civil society\nis one of the unique indicators of a liberal democracy. The fact that they are a benefit,\nnot a cost, is most evident in security trust networks. Democratic governments would\ndo well to support them as a centerpiece in Whole of Nation cyber security.\nAlexander Klimburg is a Fellow at the Austrian Institute for International Affairs. Since\njoining the Institute in October 2006, he has worked on a number of government national\nsecurity research projects. Alexander has partaken in international and inter-govern-\nmental discussions, and he acts as a scientific advisor on cyber security to the Austrian\ndelegation to the OSCE as well as other bodies. He is regularly consulted by national and\ninternational media as well as private businesses.\n202 | Chapter 13: Advice for Policy Makers from the Field"

    "input": "Afterword",
    "output": "Afterword\nIn Chapter 1, I presented a future threat scenario that involved a catastrophic chain\nreaction resulting from a coordinated hacker attack against multiple nuclear power\nplants. Granted, I painted a worst-case scenario. Since writing that chapter, I’ve\nchanged my thinking on what a worst-case scenario really is, as recent real-life events\nhave shown that threats to critical infrastructure are becoming increasingly frequent.\nOn January 18, 2008, senior CIA analyst Tom Donahue told attendees at a SANS con-\nference that a cyber attack against a foreign nation’s electric grid resulted in a wide-\nspread power outage that affected multiple cities. He did not disclose the name of the\ncountry or the date of the event. The unique nature of Donahue’s disclosure (the CIA\nalmost never does this) and the mystery surrounding the actual event attracted the\nproducers of CBS News’ 60 Minutes, and in the fall of 2009, they launched their own\ninvestigation into the situation. The findings aired on November 8, 2009 (see the seg-\nment at http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/06/60minutes/main5555565.shtml),\nwherein they named the country that Donahue was referring to in his presentation at\nthe SANS conference—Brazil:\nSeveral prominent intelligence sources confirmed that there were a series of cyber attacks\nin Brazil: one north of Rio de Janeiro in January 2005 that affected three cities and tens\nof thousands of people, and another, much larger event beginning on Sept. 26, 2007.\nThat one in the state of Espirito Santo affected more than three million people in dozens\nof cities over a two-day period, causing major disruptions. In Vitoria, the world’s largest\niron ore producer had seven plants knocked offline, costing the company $7 million. It\nis not clear who did it or what the motive was.\nOn the Monday after the 60 Minutes aired, Brazilian government officials, as well as\nthe utility company that supplies power to the affected region, immediately disputed\nthe report, claiming “sooty insulators” were the problem, not hackers. Within 24 hours\nof that public announcement, Brazil suffered another power outage affecting 90 million\npeople in Rio, Sao Paulo, and Paraguay. This remarkable act of coincidence, karma,\nbad luck, poor infrastructure, or an angry hacker crew is where the story gets interest-\ning. Because of the exposure 60 Minutes provided, more people were paying attention,\nand when the expected denial of responsibility came from ONS (Brazil’s national power\n203\ngrid operator) and some officials of the Brazilian government (they blamed it on a\nlightning strike hitting power lines), the public didn’t accept it at face value.\nWithin hours, a Brazilian hacker discovered a vulnerability of the ONS website and\nwrote about it on his blog (http://blog.hacknroll.com/2009/11/12/a-verdade-sobre-o\n-apagao/), while technicians at Brazil’s Group of Atmospheric Electricity INPE said\nthere was no lightning in the area at the time of the outage.\nIn other words, an informed public does make a difference, and that’s the entire point\nand my hope for this book: the facts, opinions, and analysis presented within these\npages will hopefully result in more attention being paid to the many known vulnera-\nbilities that remain unpatched in our high-value networks, including critical infra-\nstructure. In some cases, the problem is due to political pressure or conflicting\npriorities. In other cases, it’s a simple matter of greed; i.e., the cost of securing the power\ngrid would hurt profits and that, in the minds of certain asset owners and operators, is\nreason enough not to do it.\nIn the United States, about 90% of the power grid is privately owned and self-regulating\n(SRO) through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). NERC’s\nSRO status means that it has the final word on whether it will comply with federal cyber\nsecurity standards. As I write this, the House Committee on Energy is holding hearings\non a bill (HR 2165) to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) more\npower over NERC, so as to force the issue of cyber security–compliance. NERC is\nheavily contesting the bill, even as its outgoing CEO, Rick Sergel, publicly recognized\nthat “questions will be coming” (http://www.nerc.com/fileUploads/File/News/Executive\n-Remarks.110509.pdf) and that if NERC doesn’t act soon, it may lose its ability to\nself-regulate.\nUnfortunately, one of the areas that I didn’t cover in this book is the extent of the\nproblem that we face because of inaction on the part of NERC and its member com-\npanies. I only became aware of the extent of the problem in late August, about the time\nthat this manuscript was due. Since then, Project Grey Goose has announced a full\nopen source investigation into hacker attacks against U.S. and international electric\ngrids, and the extent of the problem is stunning. Many NERC members are resistant\nto even identifying their critical assets (29% compliance among generation owners and\n63% compliance among transmission owners [http://clarke.house.gov/2009/10/house\n-hearing-highlights-fight-over-ferc-cybersecurity-powers-energy-washington-week\n.shtml]), let alone repairing known vulnerabilities.\nInformation is even withheld from U.S. National Labs such as INL that produced the\nOctober 2005 report “Cyber Incidents Involving Control Systems,” wherein the authors\nwrote “Most companies prefer not to share cyber attack incident data because of po-\ntential financial repercussions. Uniform reporting requirements will do much to make\nthis information available to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and others who\nrequire it.” In spite of the uncooperative nature of many of the private companies that\n204 | Afterword\ncontrol the grid, this report still managed to document 120 cyber security incidents\n(while not revealing any identifying information).\nFinally, an October 2009 GAO report, “Defense Critical Infrastructure: Actions Nee-\nded to Improve the Identification and Management of Electrical Power Risks and Vul-\nnerabilities to DOD Critical Assets,” revealed that 31 out of 34 of the DOD’s most\ncritical assets are dependent upon the public power grid, which is 90% privately owned\nand, under current law, cannot be ordered to comply with hardening its networks\nagainst cyber attacks—absolutely astounding in its national security implications.\nWhy talk about the power grid now? It’s been in the background for much of this book.\nThe problems facing the power grid are paradigmatic for every level of our infrastruc-\nture, even things that you don’t normally associate with computing, like the highways.\n(A few years ago, hackers attacked the remotely controlled highway signs in Connect-\nicut. It was just a prank, but it didn’t have to be a prank.) The biggest problem we’re\nfacing isn’t the attack itself, it’s the head-in-the-sand attitude that prevents organiza-\ntions from putting the security practices and safeguards in place that would make an\nattack less likely to succeed, and less harmful if it did succeed. And what drives this\nattitude is often the legal system; an admission of vulnerability is often an admission\nof liability. Unfortunately, the best way to ensure that an attack succeeds is to deny\nthat the attack can happen.\nIf this book has accomplished anything, it’s shown that cyber warfare is increasingly\ncommon, vulnerabilities exist at every level of our infrastructure, and the worst possible\nresponse is to deny that the problem exists. Whether the attackers are military profes-\nsionals, cyber criminals, or political and religious zealots, they aren’t going away. At\nthe beginning of this afterword, I said that my opinion on the worst-case future threat\nscenario had changed: it’s not a hacker triggering a nuclear catastrophe or a\nmultimillion-node botnet freezing an entire nation’s networks. A true nightmare would\nbe if, one year from today, nothing has changed.\nAfterword | 205"

The Grey\nGoose Phase I and Phase II reports have been widely read and well received throughout\nthe intelligence, defense, and law enforcement agencies of Western governments.\nHis work has been quoted in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian,\nBusinessWeek, Parameters, and Wired.\nColophon\nThe image on the cover of Inside Cyber Warfare is of light cavalry, as evidenced by the\nlack of armor adorning the soldier and his horse. During Roman-Germanic wars, the\nduties of reconnaissance, screening, and raiding fell on the light cavalry, while their\nmore heavily armored counterparts engaged in direct enemy combat. Their weapons\nincluded spears, bows, and swords.\nThe tribes of Central Asia, including the Huns, Turks, and Mongols, often used light\ncavalry for similar missions.\nIt is important to note that practices, weapons, and so on varied depending upon his-\ntorical period and region.\nThe cover image is from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The cover font is Adobe ITC\nGaramond. The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Con-\ndensed; and the code font is LucasFont’s TheSansMonoCondensed."
