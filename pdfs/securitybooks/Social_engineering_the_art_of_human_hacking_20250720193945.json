From the inside, we look for a sense of comfort\nand assurance. From the outside, thieves, hackers, and vandals are looking for\ngaps. Most of us believe our homes are safe until one day, we find ourselves locked\nout. Suddenly, our perspective shifts and weaknesses are easily found.\nTo completely understand any kind of security it is essential to step outside of\nthe fence, in essence locking ourselves out, and start looking for other ways in. Th e\nproblem is that most of us are blinded to potential problems by our own confi dence\nor our belief that strong locks, thick doors, a high-end security system, and a guard\ndog are more than enough to keep most people at bay.\nI’m not most people. In the last ten years I have pulled more cons and scams than\nanyone in history. I’ve beaten casinos, faked sports events, fi xed auctions, talked\npeople out of their dearest possessions, and walked right past seemingly unbeatable\nlevels of security.\nI have made a living exposing the methods of thieves, liars, crooks, and con men\non a hit TV show called Th e Real Hustle. If I’d been a real criminal I would probably\nbe rich, famous, or dead—probably all three. I have used a lifetime of research into\nall forms of deception to teach the public just how vulnerable they really are.\nEach week, along with Alexis Conran, I pull real scams on real people who have\nno idea they are being ripped off . Using hidden cameras, we show the audience at\nhome what is possible so they can recognize the same scam.\nTh is unusual career has resulted in a unique understanding of how criminals\nthink. I’ve become a sheep in wolves’ clothing. I’ve learned that, no matter how\nimpossible something might seem, there’s almost always a clever, unexpected way\nto solve the problem.\nAn example of this is when I off ered to show how easy it would be to not only\nsteal a woman’s purse, but also to get her to tell me the PIN to her ATM or credit\ncards. Th e BBC didn’t think it was possible to accomplish this. When we presented\nthis as an item for Th e Real Hustle, the BBC commissioner wrote “will never hap-\npen” beside it and sent it back. We knew it was entirely possible because diff erent\nversions of the same scam had been reported, where victims of theft were talked\ninto revealing their PINs in several clever scams around the UK. We took elements\nfrom diff erent scams to illustrate exactly how someone might be duped into giving\nsomeone else complete access to their bank account.\nxiv FOREWORD\nTo prove our point we set up the scam at a local cafe. Th e cafe was on the top\nfl oor of a mall on Oxford Street in London. It was relatively quiet as I sat at an empty\ntable wearing a business suit. I placed my briefcase on the table and waited for a\nsuitable victim. In a few moments, just such a victim arrived with a friend and sat at\nthe table next to mine, placing her bag on the seat beside her. As was probably her\nhabit, she pulled the seat close and kept her hand on the bag at all times.\nI needed to steal the entire bag, but, with her hand resting on it and her friend\nsitting opposite, she was beginning to look like bad news. But, after a few minutes,\nher friend left to fi nd a restroom. Th e mark was alone so I gave Alex and Jess the\nsignal.\nPlaying the part of a couple, Alex and Jess asked the mark if she would take a\npicture of them both. She was happy to do so. She removed her hand from her bag\nto take the camera and snap a picture of the “happy couple” and, while distracted,\nI casually reached over, took her bag, and calmly locked it inside my briefcase. My\nvictim was yet to notice the empty chair as Alex and Jess left the cafe. Once out of\nsight, Alex headed quickly for the parking garage.\nIt didn’t take long for her to realize her bag was gone. Instantly, she began to\npanic. She stood up and looked around, frantically. Th is was exactly what we were\nhoping for so, I asked her if she needed help.\nShe started to ask me if I had seen anything. I told her I hadn’t but convinced her\nto sit down and think about what was in the bag. A phone. Make-up. A little cash.\nAnd her credit cards. Bingo!\nI asked who she banked with and then told her that I worked for that bank. What\na stroke of luck! I reassured her that everything would be fi ne but she would need\nto cancel her credit card right away. I called the “help-desk” number, which was\nactually Alex, and handed my phone to her. She was hooked and it was now up to\nAlex to reel her in.\nAlex was downstairs in the van. On the dashboard, a CD player was playing offi ce\nnoises we had downloaded from the Internet. He kept the mark calm, strung her\nalong, and then assured her that her card could easily be canceled but, to verify her\nidentity, she needed to enter her PIN on the keypad of the phone she was using.\nMy phone and my keypad.\nYou can guess the rest. Once we had her PIN, I left her with her friend and headed\nfor the door. If we were real thieves, we would have had access to her account via\nATM withdrawals and chip and PIN purchases. Fortunately for her, it was just a\nTV show and she was so happy when I came back to return her bag and tell her it\nwas all a fake scam. She even thanked me for giving her bag back to which I replied,\n“Don’t thank me. I’m the one who stole it.”\nFOREWORD xv\nNo matter how secure a system is, there’s always a way to break through. Often,\nthe human elements of the system are the easiest to manipulate and deceive.\nCreating a state of panic, using infl uence, manipulation tactics, or causing feelings\nof trust are all methods used to put a victim at ease.\nTh e scenario outlined here is an extreme example, but it shows that, with a little\ncreativity, seemingly impossible scams can be pulled off .\nTh e fi rst step in becoming more secure is simply conceding that a system is\nvulnerable and can be compromised. On the contrary, by believing a breach is\nimpossible, a blindfold is placed over your eyes as you run full speed ahead. Social\nEngineering is designed to provide you with invaluable insight into the methods\nused to break seemingly secure systems and expose the threats that exist in the\nlargest vulnerability, the people. Th is book is not a guide for hackers—they already\nknow how to break in and are fi nding new ways every day. Instead, Chris Hadnagy\noff ers those inside the fence an opportunity to take a look from the other side, the\ndark side, as he exposes the thinking and methods of the world’s most malicious\nhackers, con men, and social engineers.\nRemember: those who build walls think diff erently than those who seek to go\nover, under, around, or through them. As I often tell my audiences, if you think you\ncan’t be conned, you’re just the person I’d like to meet.\nPaul Wilson\nOctober 2010",

    "text": "PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI\nt was just a few years ago that I was sitting with my friend and mentor, Mati\nAharoni, deciding to launch www.social-engineer.org. The idea grew and grew\nuntil it became an amazing website supported by some truly brilliant people. It didn’t\ntake long to come up with the idea to put those years of research and experience\ndown into the pages of a book. When I had the idea, I was met with overwhelming\nsupport. That said, some specific acknowledgements are very important to how this\nbook became what it is today.\nFrom a very young age I was always interested in manipulating people. Not in\na bad way, but I found it interesting how many times I was able to obtain things or\nbe in situations that would be unreal. One time I was with a good friend and busi-\nness associate at a tech conference at the Javits Center in New York City. A large\ncorporation had rented FAO Schwarz for a private party. Of course, the party was\nby invitation only, and my friend and I were two small fi sh in a large pond: the party\nwas for the CEOs and upper management of companies like HP, Microsoft, and the\nlike. My friend said to me, “It would be really cool to get into that party.”\nI simply responded, “Why can’t we?” At that point I thought to myself, “I know we\ncan get in there if we just ask the right way.” So I approached the women in charge\nof the ticket booth and the guest list and I spoke to them for a few minutes. As I\nwas speaking to them, Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, walked by.\nI had picked up a Microsoft plush toy at one of the booths and as I joke I turned to\nLinus and said, “Hey, you want to autograph my Microsoft toy?”\nHe got a good laugh out of it and as he grabbed his tickets he said, “Nice job,\nyoung man. I will see you at the party.”\nI turned back to the women in charge of the ticket booth and was handed two\ntickets to an exclusive party inside FAO Schwartz.\nIt wasn’t until later in life that I began to analyze stories like this, after some\nstarted calling it “the Hadnagy Eff ect.” As funny as that sounds, I began to see that\nmuch of what occurred to me wasn’t luck or fate, but rather knowing how to be\nwhere I needed to be at the right time.\nTh at doesn’t mean it didn’t take hard work and a lot of help along the way. My\nmuse in life is my wonderful wife. For almost two decades you have supported me\nin all my ideas and eff orts and you are my best friend, my confi dant, and my support\npillar. Without you I would not be where I am today. In addition, you have produced\nxviii PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\ntwo of the most beautiful children on this planet. My son and my daughter are\nthe motivation to keep doing all of this. If anything I do can make this place just\na little more secure for them, or teach them how to keep themselves safe, it is all\nworthwhile.\nTo my son and daughter, I cannot express enough gratitude for your support,\nlove, and motivation. My hope is that my son and my little princess will not have to\ndeal with the malicious, bad people out in this world, but I know just how unlikely\nthat is. May this information keep you both just a little more secure.\nPaul, aka rAWjAW, thanks for all your support on the website. Th e thousands of\nhours you spent as the “wiki-master” paid off and now we have a beautiful resource\nfor the world to use. I know I don’t say it enough, but “you’re fi red!” Combined with\nthe beautiful creation of Tom, aka DigIp, the website is a work of art.\nCarol, my editor at Wiley, worked her butt off to get this organized and follow-\ning some semblance of a timeline. She did an amazing job putting together a great\nteam of people and making this idea a reality. Th ank you.\nBrian, I meant what I said. I am going to miss you when this is over. As I worked\nwith you over the last few months I began to look forward to my editing sessions\nand the knowledge you would lay on me. Your honest and frank counsel and advice\nmade this book better than it was.\nMy gratitude goes out to Jim, aka Elwood, as well. Without you a lot of what has\nhappened on social-engineer.org as well as inside this book, heck in my life in\nthe last couple years, would not be a reality. Th ank you for keeping me humble\nand in check. Your constant reality checks helped me stay focused and balance\nthe many diff erent roles I had to play. Th ank you.\nLiz, about twelve years ago you told me I should write a book. I am sure you had\nsomething diff erent in mind, but here it is. You have helped me through some pretty\ndark times. Th ank you and I love you.\nMati, my mentor, and my achoti, where would I be without you? Mati, you truly\nare my mentor and my brother. Th ank you from the bottom of my heart for having\nthe faith in me that I could write this book and launch www.social-engineer.org\nand that both would be good. More than that, your constant counsel and direction\nhave been translated on the pages of this book to make me more than I thought I\ncould be.\nYour support with the BackTrack team along with the support of the team at\nwww.offensive-security.com have transcended all I could have expected. Th ank\nyou for helping me balance and prioritize. My achoti, a special thanks to you for\nbeing the voice of reason and the light at the end of some frustrating days. With\nall my love I thank you.\nPREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS xix\nEach person I mentioned here contributed to this book in some fashion. With\ntheir help, support and love this book has become a work that I am proud to have\nmy name on. For the rest of you who have supported the site, the channel, and our\nresearch, thank you.\nAs you read this book, I hope it aff ects you the way writing it has aff ected me.\nAlbert Einstein once said, “Information is not knowledge.” Th at is a powerful\nthought. Just reading this book will not somehow implant this knowledge into your\nbeing. Apply the principles, practice what is taught in these pages, and make the\ninformation a part of your daily life. When you do, you will then see this knowledge\ntake eff ect.\nChristopher Hadnagy\nOctober 2010\nSocial Engineering\nA Look into the\n1\nWorld of Social\nEngineering\nIf you know the enemy and know yourself you need\nnot fear the results of a hundred battles.\n—Sun Tzu\nS\nocial engineering (SE) has been largely misunderstood, leading to many differing\nopinions on what social engineering is and how it works. This has led to a situa-\ntion where some may view SE as simply lying to scam trivial free items such as pizza or\nobtaining sexual gratification; others think SE just refers to the tools used by criminals\nor con men, or perhaps that it is a science whose theories can be broken down into\nparts or equations and studied. Or perhaps it’s a long-lost mystical art giving practi-\ntioners the ability to use powerful mind tricks like a magician or illusionist.\nIn whatever camp your fl ag fl ies, this book is for you. Social engineering is used\nevery day by everyday people in everyday situations. A child trying to get her way in\nthe candy aisle or an employee looking for a raise is using social engineering. Social\nengineering happens in government or small business marketing. Unfortunately, it\nis also present when criminals, con men, and the like trick people into giving away\ninformation that makes them vulnerable to crimes. Like any tool, social engineering\nis not good or evil, but simply a tool that has many diff erent uses.\nConsider some of these questions to drive that point home:\n» Have you been tasked to make sure your company is as secure as possible?\n» Are you a security enthusiast who reads every bit of the latest informa-\ntion out there?\n» Are you a professional penetration tester who is hired to test the security\nof your clients?\n» Are you a college student taking some form of IT specialization as your\nmajor?\n2 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Are you presently a social engineer looking for new and improved ideas\nto utilize in your practice?\n» Are you a consumer who fears the dangers of fraud and identity theft?\nRegardless of which one of those situations fi ts you, the information contained\nwithin this book will open your eyes to how you can use social engineering skills.\nYou will also peer into the dark world of social engineering and learn how the “bad\nguys” use these skills to gain an upper hand. From there, you learn how to become\nless vulnerable to social engineering attacks.\nOne warning up front: Th is book is not for the weak. It takes you into those dark\ncorners of society where the “black hats,” the malicious hackers, live. It uncovers and\ndelves into areas of social engineering that are employed by spies and con men. It\nreviews tactics and tools that seem like they are stolen from a James Bond movie. In\naddition, it covers common, everyday situations and then shows how they are com-\nplex social engineering scenarios. In the end, the book uncovers the “insider” tips\nand tricks of professional social engineers and yes, even professional criminals.\nSome have asked why I would be willing to reveal this information. Th e answer\nis simple: Th e “bad guys” don’t stop because of a contractual limitation or their own\nmorals. Th ey don’t cease after one failed attempt. Malicious hackers don’t go away\nbecause companies don’t like their servers to be infi ltrated. Instead, social engineer-\ning, employee deception, and Internet fraud are used more and more each day. While\nsoftware companies are learning how to strengthen their programs, hackers and\nmalicious social engineers are turning to the weakest part of the infrastructure—the\npeople. Th eir motivation is all about return on investment (ROI); no self-respecting\nhacker is going to spend 100 hours to get the same results from a simple attack that\ntakes one hour, or less.\nTh e sad result in the end is that no way exists to be 100% secure—unless you\nunplug all electronic devices and move to the mountains. Because that isn’t too\npractical, nor is it a lot of fun, this book discusses ways to become more aware and\neducated about the attacks out there and then outlines methods that you can use to\nprotect against them. My motto is “security through education.” Being educated is\none of the only surefi re ways to remain secure against the increasing threats of social\nengineering and identity theft. Kaspersky Lab, a leading provider of antivirus and\nprotection software, estimated that more than 100,000 malware samples were spread\nthrough social networks in 2009. In a recent report, Kaspersky estimated that “attacks\nagainst social networks are 10 times more successful” than other types of attacks.\nTh e old hacker adage, “knowledge is power” does apply here. Th e more knowl-\nedge and understanding one has of the dangers and threats of social engineering\nA LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 3\neach consumer and business can have and the more each attack scenario is dis-\nsected, the easier it will be to protect from, mitigate, and stop these attacks. Th at is\nwhere the power of all this knowledge will come in.\nWhy This Book Is So Valuable\nMany books are available on the market on security, hacking, penetration testing,\nand even social engineering. Many of these books have very valuable information\nand tips to help their readers. Even with all the information available, a book was\nneeded that takes social engineering information to the next level and describes\nthese attacks in detail, explaining them from the malicious side of the fence. Th is\nbook is not merely a collection of cool stories, neat hacks, or wild ideas. Th is book\ncovers the world’s fi rst framework for social engineering. It analyzes and dissects the\nvery foundation of what makes a good social engineer and gives practical advice on\nhow to use these skills to enhance the readers’ abilities to test the biggest weakness—\nthe human infrastructure.\nThe Layout\nTh is book off ers a unique approach to social engineering. It is structured closely to\nthe in-depth social engineering framework found at www.social-engineer.org/\nframework. Th is framework outlines the skills and the tools (physical, mental, and\npersonality) a person should strive to possess to be an excellent social engineer.\nTh is book takes a “tell and show approach” by fi rst presenting a principle behind\na topic then defi ning, explaining, and dissecting, then showing its application\nusing collections of real stories or case studies. Th is is not merely a book about\nstories or neat tricks, but a handbook, a guide through the dark world of social\nengineering.\nTh roughout the book you can fi nd many Internet links to stories or accounts as\nwell as links to tools and other aspects of the topics discussed. Practical exercises\nappear throughout the book that are designed to help you master not only the social\nengineering framework but also the skills to enhance your daily communications.\nTh ese statements are especially true if you are a security specialist. As you read\nthis book, I hope to impress upon you that security is not a “part-time” job and is\nnot something to take lightly. As criminals and malicious social engineers seem to\ngo from bad to worse in this world, attacks on businesses and personal lives seem\nto get more intense. Naturally, everyone wants to be protected, as evidenced by\n4 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nthe increase in sales for personal protection software and devices. Although these\nitems are important, the best protection is knowledge: security through education.\nTh e only true way to reduce the eff ect of these attacks is to know that they exist, to\nknow how they are done, and to understand the thinking process and mentality of\nthe people who would do such things.\nWhen you possess this knowledge and you understand how malicious hackers\nthink, a light bulb goes off . Th at proverbial light will shine upon the once-darkened\ncorners and enable you to clearly see the “bad guys” lurking there. When you can\nsee the way these attacks are used ahead of time, you can prepare your company's\nand your personal aff airs to ward them off .\nOf course, I am not contradicting what I said earlier; I believe there is no way to\ntruly be 100% secure. Even top-secret, highly guarded secrets can be and have been\nhacked in the simplest of manners.\nLook at the archived story at www.social-engineer.org/resources/book/\nTopSecretStolen.htm, from a newspaper in Ottawa, Canada. Th is story is very inter-\nesting, because some documents ended up in the wrong hands. Th ese weren’t just any\ndocuments, but top-secret defense documents that outlined things such as locations\nof security fences at the Canadian Forces Base (CFB) in Trenton, the fl oor plan of the\nCanadian Joint Incident Response Unit, and more. How did the breach occur? Th e\nplans were thrown away, in the trashcan, and someone found them in the dumpster. A\nsimple dumpster dive could have led to one of that country’s largest security breaches.\nSimple-yet-deadly attacks are launched every day and point to the fact that people\nneed education; need to change the way they adhere to password policies and the\nway they handle remote access to servers; and need to change the way they handle\ninterviews, deliveries, and employees who are hired or fi red. Yet without education\nthe motivation for change just isn’t there.\nIn 2003 the Computer Security Institute did a survey along with the FBI and\nfound that 77% of the companies interviewed stated a disgruntled employee as\nthe source of a major security breach. Vontu, the data loss prevention section of\nSymantec (http://go.symantec.com/vontu/), says that 1 out of every 500 emails\ncontains confi dential data. Some of the highlights of that report, quoted from\nhttp://financialservices.house.gov/media/pdf/062403ja.pdf, are as follows:\n» 62% reported incidents at work that could put customer data at risk for\nidentity theft.\n» 66% say their co-workers, not hackers, pose the greatest risk to consumer\nprivacy. Only 10% said hackers were the greatest threat.\nA LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 5\n» 46% say it would be “easy” to “extremely easy” for workers to remove sen-\nsitive data from the corporate database.\n» 32%, about one in three, are unaware of internal company policies to\nprotect customer data.\nTh ese are staggering and stomach-wrenching statistics.\nLater chapters discuss these numbers in more detail. Th e numbers show a serious\nfl aw in the way security itself is handled. When there is education, hopefully before\na breach, then people can make changes that can prevent unwanted loss, pain, and\nmonetary damage.\nSun Tzu said, “If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the\nresults of a hundred battles.” How true those words are, but knowing is just half the\nbattle. Action on knowledge is what defi nes wisdom, not just knowledge alone.\nTh is book is most eff ective used as a handbook or guide through the world of\nsocial attacks, social manipulation, and social engineering.\nWhat’s Coming Up\nTh is book is designed to cover all aspects, tools, and skills used by professional and\nmalicious social engineers. Each chapter delves deep into the science and art of\na specifi c social engineering skill to show you how it can be used, enhanced, and\nperfected.\nTh e next section of this chapter, “Overview of Social Engineering,” defi nes social\nengineering and what roles it plays in society today, as well as the diff erent types of\nsocial engineering attacks, including other areas of life where social engineering is\nused in a non-malicious way. I will also discuss how a social engineer can use the\nsocial engineering framework in planning an audit or enhancing his own skills.\nChapter 2 is where the real meat of the lessons begins. Information gathering is\nthe foundation of every social engineering audit. Th e social engineer’s mantra is, “I\nam only as good as the information I gather.” A social engineer can possess all the\nskills in the world, but if he or she doesn’t know about the target, if the social engi-\nneer hasn’t outlined every intimate detail, then the chance of failure is more likely\nto occur. Information gathering is the crux of every social engineering engagement,\nalthough people skills and the ability to think on your feet can help you get out of a\nsticky situation. More often than not, the more information you gather, the better\nyour chances of success.\n6 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh e questions that I will answer in that chapter include the following:\n» What sources can a social engineer use?\n» What information is useful?\n» How can a social engineer collect, gather, and organize this information?\n» How technical should a social engineer get?\n» How much information is enough?\nAfter the analyzation of information gathering, the next topic addressed in\nChapter 2 is communication modeling. Th is topic closely ties in with information\ngathering. First I will discuss what communication modeling is and how it began as\na practice. Th en the chapter walks through the steps needed to develop and then use\na proper communication model. It outlines how a social engineer uses this model\nagainst a target and the benefi ts in outlining it for every engagement.\nChapter 3 covers elicitation, the next logical step in the framework. It off ers a very\nin-depth look into how questions are used to gain information, passwords, in-depth\nknowledge of the target, and his or her company. You will learn what is good and proper\nelicitation and learn how important it is to have your elicitations planned out.\nChapter 3 also covers the important topic of preloading the target’s mind with\ninformation to make your questions more readily accepted. As you unravel this\nsection you will clearly see how important it is to become an excellent elicitor. You\nwill also clearly see how you can use that skill not just in your security practices\nbut in daily life.\nChapter 4, which covers pretexting, is powerful. Th is heavy topic is one of the\ncritical points for many social engineers. Pretexting involves developing the role\nthe social engineer will play for the attack on the company. Will the social engi-\nneer be a customer, vendor, tech support, new hire, or something equally realistic\nand believable? Pretexting involves not just coming up with the storyline but also\ndeveloping the way your persona would look, act, talk, walk; deciding what tools\nand knowledge they would have; and then mastering the entire package so when\nyou approach the target, you are that person, and not simply playing a character.\nTh e questions covered include the following:\n» What is pretexting?\n» How do you develop a pretext?\n» What are the principles of a successful pretext?\n» How can a social engineer plan and then execute a perfect pretext?\nA LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 7\nTh e next step in the framework is one that can fi ll volumes. Yet it must be dis-\ncussed from the viewpoint of a social engineer. Chapter 5 is a no-holds-barred dis-\ncussion on some very confrontational topics, including that of eye cues. For example,\nwhat are the varying opinions of some professionals about eye cues, and how can\na social engineer use them? Th e chapter also delves into the fascinating science of\nmicroexpressions and its implications on social engineering.\nChapter 5 goes on analyzing the research, yielding answers to these questions:\n» Is it possible to use microexpressions in the fi eld of security?\n» How would you do so?\n» What benefi t are microexpressions?\n» Can people train themselves to learn how to pick up on microexpres-\nsions automatically?\n» After we do the training, what information is obtained through\nmicroexpressions?\nProbably one of the most debated-on topics in Chapter 5 is neurolinguistic pro-\ngramming (NLP). Th e debate has many people undecided on what it is and how it\ncan be used. Chapter 5 presents a brief history of NLP as well as what makes NLP\nsuch a controversy. You can decide for yourself whether NLP is usable in social\nengineering.\nChapter 5 also discusses one of the most important aspects of social engineering\nin person or on the phone: knowing how to ask good questions, listen to responses,\nand then ask more questions. Interrogation and interviewing are two methods that\nlaw enforcement have used for years to manipulate criminals to confess as well as to\nsolve the hardest cases. Th is part of Chapter 5 puts to practical use the knowledge\nyou gained in Chapter 3.\nIn addition, Chapter 5 discusses how to build instant rapport—a skill you can use\nin everyday life. Th e chapter ends by covering my own personal research into “the\nhuman buff er overfl ow”: the notion that the human mind is much like the software\nthat hackers exploit every day. By applying certain principles, a skilled social engi-\nneer can overfl ow the human mind and inject any command they want.\nJust like hackers write overfl ows to manipulate software to execute code, the\nhuman mind can be given certain instructions to, in essence, “overfl ow” the target\nand insert custom instructions. Chapter 5 is a mind-blowing lesson in how to use\nsome simple techniques to master how people think.\n8 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nMany people have spent their lives researching and proving what can and does infl u-\nence people. Infl uence is a powerful tool with many facets to it. To this end, Chapter 6\ndiscusses the fundamentals of persuasion. Th e principles engaged in Chapter 6 will\nstart you on the road toward becoming a master of persuasion.\nTh e chapter presents a brief discussion of the diff erent types of persuasion that\nexist and provides examples to help solidify how you can use these facets in social\nengineering.\nTh e discussion doesn’t stop there—framing is also a hot topic nowadays. Many\ndiff erent opinions exist on how one can use framing, and this book shows some real-\nlife examples of it. Th en dissecting each, I take you through the lessons learned and\nthings you can do to practice reframing yourself as well as use framing in everyday\nlife as a social engineer.\nAnother overwhelming theme in social engineering is manipulation:\n» What is its purpose?\n» What kinds of incentives drive manipulators?\n» How can a person use it in social engineering?\nChapter 6 presents all a social engineer needs to know on the topic of manipula-\ntion, and how to successfully apply such skills.\nChapter 7 covers the tools that can make a social engineering audit more suc-\ncessful. From physical tools such as hidden cameras to software-driven information\ngathering tools, each section covers tested-and-tried tools for social engineers.\nOnce you understand the social engineering framework, Chapter 8 discusses\nsome real-life case studies. I have chosen two excellent accounts from world-\nrenowned social engineer Kevin Mitnick. I analyze, dissect, and then propose what\nyou can learn from these examples and identify the methods he used from the social\nengineering framework. Moreover, I discuss what can be learned from his attack\nvectors as well as how they can be used today. I discuss some personal accounts\nand dissect them, as well.\nWhat social engineering guide would be complete without discussing some of\nthe ways you can mitigate these attacks? Th e appendix provides this information. I\nanswer some common questions on mitigation and give some excellent tips to help\nsecure you and your organization against these malicious attacks.\nTh e preceding overview is just a taste of what is to come. I truly hope you enjoy\nreading this book as much as I have enjoyed writing it. Social engineering is a pas-\nsion for me. I do believe there are certain traits, whether learned or inherent, that can\nA LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 9\nmake someone a great social engineer. I also subscribe to the belief that with enough\ntime and energy anyone can learn the diff erent aspects of social engineering and then\npractice these skills to become a profi cient social engineer.\nTh e principles in this book are not new; there is no mind-blowing technology\nthat you will see that will change the face of security forever. Th ere are no magic\npills. As a matter of fact, the principles have been around for as long as people have.\nWhat this book does do is combine all of these skills in one location. It does give\nyou clear direction on how to practice these skills as well as examples of real-life\nsituations where they are used. All of this information can help you gain a true sense\nof understanding the topics discussed.\nTh e best place to start is with the basics, by answering one fundamental question:\n“What is social engineering?”\nOverview of Social Engineering\nWhat is social engineering?\nI once asked this question to a group of security enthusiasts and I was shocked\nat the answers I received:\n“Social engineering is lying to people to get information.”\n“Social engineering is being a good actor.”\n“Social engineering is knowing how to get stuff for free.”\nWikipedia defi nes it as “the act of manipulating people into performing actions\nor divulging confi dential information. While similar to a confi dence trick or simple\nfraud, the term typically applies to trickery or deception for the purpose of informa-\ntion gathering, fraud, or computer system access; in most cases the attacker never\ncomes face-to-face with the victim.”\nAlthough it has been given a bad name by the plethora of “free pizza,” “free cof-\nfee,” and “how to pick up chicks” sites, aspects of social engineering actually touch\nmany parts of daily life.\nWebster’s Dictionary defi nes social as “of or pertaining to the life, welfare, and\nrelations of human beings in a community.” It also defi nes engineering as “the art or\nscience of making practical application of the knowledge of pure sciences, as physics\nor chemistry, as in the construction of engines, bridges, buildings, mines, ships, and\nchemical plants or skillful or artful contrivance; maneuvering.”\n10 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nCombining those two defi nitions you can easily see that social engineering is\nthe art or better yet, science, of skillfully maneuvering human beings to take action\nin some aspect of their lives.\nTh is defi nition broadens the horizons of social engineers everywhere. Social\nengineering is used in everyday life in the way children get their parents to give in\nto their demands. It is used in the way teachers interact with their students, in the\nway doctors, lawyers, or psychologists obtain information from their patients or\nclients. It is defi nitely used in law enforcement, and in dating—it is truly used in\nevery human interaction from babies to politicians and everyone in between.\nI like to take that defi nition a step further and say that a true defi nition of social\nengineering is the act of manipulating a person to take an action that may or may\nnot be in the “target’s” best interest. Th is may include obtaining information, gain-\ning access, or getting the target to take certain action.\nFor example, doctors, psychologists, and therapists often use elements I consider\nsocial engineering to “manipulate” their patients to take actions that are good for\nthem, whereas a con man uses elements of social engineering to convince his target\nto take actions that lead to loss for them. Even though the end game is much dif-\nferent, the approach may be very much the same. A psychologist may use a series\nof well-conceived questions to help a patient come to a conclusion that change is\nneeded. Similarly, a con man will use well-crafted questions to move his target into\na vulnerable position.\nBoth of these examples are social engineering at its truest form, but have very\ndiff erent goals and results. Social engineering is not just about deceiving people or\nlying or acting a part. In a conversation I had with Chris Nickerson, a well-known\nsocial engineer from the TV series Tiger Team, he said, “True social engineering is\nnot just believing you are playing a part, but for that moment you are that person,\nyou are that role, it is what your life is.”\nSocial engineering is not just any one action but a collection of the skills men-\ntioned in the framework that when put together make up the action, the skill, and\nthe science I call social engineering. In the same way, a wonderful meal is not\njust one ingredient, but is made up by the careful combining, mixing, and adding\nof many ingredients. Th is is how I imagine social engineering to be, and a good\nsocial engineer is like a master chef. Put in a little dab of elicitation, add a shake of\nmanipulation, and a few heaping handfuls of pretexting, and bam!—out comes a\ngreat meal of the perfect social engineer.\nOf course, this book discusses some of these facets, but the main focus is what\nyou can learn from law enforcement, the politicians, the psychologists, and even\nA LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 11\nchildren to better your abilities to audit and then secure yourself. Analyzing how\na child can manipulate a parent so easily gives the social engineer insight into how\nthe human mind works. Noticing how a psychologist phrases questions can help\nto see what puts people at ease. Noticing how a law enforcement agent performs\na successful interrogation gives a clear path on how to obtain information from a\ntarget. Seeing how governments and politicians frame their messages for the great-\nest impact can show what works and what doesn’t. Analyzing how an actor gets\ninto a role can open your eyes to the amazing world of pretexting. By dissecting the\nresearch and work of some of the leading minds in microexpressions and persuasion\nyou can see how to use these techniques in social engineering. By reviewing some\nof the motivators of some of the world’s greatest salespeople and persuasion experts\nyou can learn how to build rapport, put people at ease, and close deals.\nTh en by researching and analyzing the fl ip side of this coin—the con men, scam\nartists, and thieves—you can learn how all of these skills come together to infl uence\npeople and move people in directions they thought they would never go.\nMix this knowledge with the skills of lock picks, spies who use hidden cameras,\nand professional information gatherers and you have a talented social engineer.\nYou do not use every one of these skills in each engagement, nor can you master\nevery one of these skills. Instead, by understanding how these skills work and when\nto use them, anyone can master the science of social engineering. It is true that\nsome people have a natural talent, like Kevin Mitnick, who could talk anyone into\nanything, it seemed. Frank Abagnale, Jr., seemed to have the natural talents to con\npeople into believing he was who he wanted them to believe he was. Victor Lustig\ndid the unbelievable, actually convincing some people that he had the rights to sell\nthe Eiff el Tower, topped only by his scam on Al Capone.\nTh ese social engineers and many more like them seem to have natural talent or\na lack of fear that enables them to try things that most of us would never consider\nattempting. Unfortunately in the world today, malicious hackers are continually\nimproving their skills at manipulating people and malicious social engineering attacks\nare increasing. DarkReading posted an article (www.darkreading.com/d atabase_\nsecurity/security/attacks/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=226200272) that\ncites that data breaches have reached between $1 and $53 million per breach. Citing\nresearch by the Ponemon Institute DarkReading states, “Ponemon found that Web-\nborne attacks, malicious code, and malicious insiders are the most costly types of\nattacks, making up more than 90 percent of all cybercrime costs per organization\nper year: A Web-based attack costs $143,209; malicious code, $124,083; and mali-\ncious insiders, $100,300.” Malicious insiders being listed on the top three suggests\n12 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nthat businesses need to be more aware of the threats posed by malicious social\nengineering, even from employees.\nMany of these attacks could have been avoided if people were educated, because\nthey could act on that education. Sometimes just fi nding out how malicious people\nthink and act can be an eye opener.\nAs example on a much smaller and more personal scale, I was recently discuss-\ning with a close friend her fi nancial accounts and how she was worried about being\nhacked or scammed. In the course of the conversation we started to discuss how\neasy it is to “guess” people’s passwords. I told her that many people use the same\npasswords for every account; I saw her face go white as she realized this is her. I\ntold her that most people use simplistic passwords that combine things like their\nspouse’s name, his or her birthday, or anniversary date. I saw her go an ever-brighter\nshade of pale. I continued by saying that most of the time people chose the simplest\n“security question” such as “your (or your mother’s) maiden name” and how easy\nfi nding that information is via the Internet or a few fake phone calls.\nMany people will list this information in Blippy, Twitter, or Facebook accounts.\nTh is particular friend didn’t use social media sites too much, so I asked her that\nif she thought with a few phone calls she could picture herself giving over this\ninformation. Of course she said no. To illustrate how easily people hand over per-\nsonal information, I told her that I once saw a placemat in a restaurant that had a\n$50-off coupon for a local golf course—a very attractive off er. To take advantage\nof this off er, you only had to provide your name, date of birth, and street address,\nand provide a password for an account that would be set up and sent to your e-mail\naddress. (I only noticed this in the fi rst place because someone had started fi lling\nout the coupon and left it on the table.) Every day websites are created to collect\nsuch sensitive information.\nA phone call with a survey or some quick research on the Internet can yield a\nbirth date or anniversary date, and armed with this information I have enough to\nbuild a password attack list. Plus, a dozen sites off er detailed records of all sorts of\npersonal information on an individual for a mere $9–$30 USD.\nRealizing how malicious social engineers think, how scammers react to infor-\nmation, and how con men will try anything, can help people to be more aware of\nwhat is going on around them.\nA team of security enthusiasts and I have scoured the Internet collecting stories\nthat show many diff erent aspects of social engineering. Th ese stories can help answer\na vital question—“how is social engineering used in society over time?”—and see\nwhere social engineering’s place is and how it is used maliciously.",

    "text": "A LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 13\nSocial Engineering and Its Place in Society\nAs already discussed social engineering can be used in many areas of life, but not\nall of these uses are malicious or bad. Many times social engineering can be used\nto motivate a person to take an action that is good for them. How?\nTh ink about this: John needs to lose weight. He knows he is unhealthy and needs\nto do something about it. All of John’s friends are overweight, too. Th ey even make\njokes about the joys of being overweight and say things like, “I love not worrying\nabout my fi gure.” On one hand, this is an aspect of social engineering. It is social\nproof or consensus, where what you fi nd or deem acceptable is determined by those\naround you. Because John’s close associations view being overweight as acceptable,\nit is easier for John to accept it. However, if one of those friends lost weight and did\nnot become judgmental but was motivated to help, the possibility exists that John’s\nmental frame about his weight might change and he might start to feel that losing\nweight is possible and good.\nTh is is, in essence, social engineering. So you can clearly see how social engineer-\ning fi ts into society and everyday life, the following sections present a few examples\nof social engineering, scams, and manipulation and a review of how they worked.\nThe 419 Scam\nTh e 419 scam, better known as the Nigerian Scam, has grown into an epidemic. You\ncan fi nd an archived story and article about this scam at www.social-engineer\n.org/wiki/archives/ConMen/ConMen-Scam-NigerianFee.html.\nBasically an email (or as of late, a letter) comes to the target telling him he has\nbeen singled out for a very lucrative deal and all he needs to do is off er a little bit\nof help. If the victim will help the letter sender extract a large sum of money from\nforeign banks he can have a percentage. After the target is confi dent and “signs on,”\na problem arises that causes the target to pay a fee. After the fee is paid another\nproblem comes up, along with another fee. Each problem is “the last” with “one\nfi nal fee” and this can be stretched out over many months. Th e victim never sees\nany money and loses from $10,000–$50,000 USD in the process. What makes this\nscam so amazing is that in the past, offi cial documents, papers, letterhead, and even\nface-to-face meetings have been reported.\nRecently a variation of this scam has popped up where victims are literally sent\na real check. Th e scammers promise a huge sum of money and want in return only\na small portion for their eff orts. If the target will wire transfer a small sum (in\ncomparison) of $10,000, when they receive the promised check they can deposit the\n14 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ncheck and keep the diff erence. Th e problem is that the check that comes is a fraud\nand when the victim goes to cash it she is slapped with check fraud charges and\nfi nes, in some cases after the victim has already wired money to the scammer.\nTh is scam is successful because it plays on the victim’s greed. Who wouldn’t give\n$10,000 to make $1,000,000 or even $100,000? Most smart people would. When\nthese people are presented with offi cial documents, passports, receipts, and even\noffi cial offi ces with “government personnel” then their belief is set and they will go\nto great lengths to complete the deal. Commitment and consistency play a part in\nthis scam as well as obligation. I discuss these attributes in greater detail in later\nchapters, and when I do, you will see why this scam is so powerful.\nThe Power of Scarcity\nTh e article archived at www.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/Governments/\nGovernments-FoodElectionWeapon.html talks about a principle called scarcity.\nScarcity is when people are told something they need or want has limited avail-\nability and to get it they must comply with a certain attitude or action. Many times\nthe desired behavior is not even spoken, but the way it is conveyed is by showing\npeople who are acting “properly” getting rewards.\nTh e article talks about the use of food to win elections in South Africa. When a\ngroup or person does not support the “right” leader, foodstuff s become scarce and\njobs people once had are given to others who are more supportive. When people see\nthis in action, it doesn’t take long to get them in line. Th is is a very malicious and\nhurtful form of social engineering, but nonetheless, one to learn from. It is often\nthe case that people want what is scarce and they will do anything if they are lead\nto believe that certain actions will cause them to lose out on those items. What\nmakes certain cases even worse, as in the earlier example, is that a government took\nsomething necessary to life and made it “scarce” and available only to supporters—a\nmalicious, but very eff ective, manipulation tactic.\nThe Dalai Lama and Social Engineering\nTh e interesting article archived at www.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/\nSpies/Spies-DalaiLama.html details an attack made on the Dalai Lama in 2009.\nA Chinese hacker group wanted to access the servers and fi les on the network\nowned by the Dalai Lama. What methods were used in this successful attack?\nTh e attackers convinced the offi ce staff at the Dalai Lama’s offi ce to download\nand open malicious software on their servers. Th is attack is interesting because it\nblends both technology hacking and social engineering.\nA LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 15\nTh e article states, “Th e software was attached to e-mails that purported to come\nfrom colleagues or contacts in the Tibetan movement, according to researcher\nRoss Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge\nComputer Laboratory, cited by the Washington Times Monday. Th e software stole\npasswords and other information, which in turn gave the hackers access to the\noffi ce’s e-mail system and documents stored on computers there.”\nManipulation was used as well as common attack vectors such as phishing (the\npractice of sending out emails with enticing messages and links or fi les that must\nbe opened to receive more information; often those links or fi les lead to malicious\npayloads) and exploitation. Th is attack can work and has worked against major\ncorporations as well as governments. Th is example is just one in a large pool of\nexamples where these vectors cause massive damage.\nEmployee Theft\nTh e topic of employee theft could fi ll volumes, especially in light of the staggering statis-\ntic found at www.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/DisgruntledEmployees/\nDisgruntledEmployees-EmployeeTheft.html that more than 60 percent of employ-\nees interviewed admitted to taking data of one sort or another from their employers.\nMany times this data is sold to competitors (as happened in this story from\na Morgan Stanley employee: www.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/\nDisgruntledEmployees/DisgruntledEmployees-MorganStanley.html). Other\ntimes employee theft is in time or other resources; in some cases a disgruntled\nemployee can cause major damage.\nI once talked to a client about employee discharge policies, things like disabling\nkey cards, disconnecting network accounts, and escorting discharged employees\nout of the building. Th e company felt that everyone was part of the “family” and\nthat those policies wouldn’t apply.\nUnfortunately, the time came to let go of “Jim,” one of the higher-ranking people\nin the company. Th e “fi ring” went well; it was amicable and Jim said he understood.\nTh e one thing the company did right was to handle the fi ring around closing time\nto avoid embarrassment and distraction. Hands were shook and then Jim asked the\nfateful question, “Can I take an hour to clean out my desk and take some personal\npictures off my computer? I will turn my key card into the security guard before I\nleave.”\nFeeling good about the meeting, they all quickly agreed and left with smiles and\na few laughs. Th en Jim went to his offi ce, packed a box of all his personal items,\ntook the pictures and other data off his computer, connected to the network, and\n16 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nwiped clean 11 servers’ worth of data—accounting records, payroll, invoices, orders,\nhistory, graphics, and much more just deleted in a matter of minutes. Jim turned in\nhis key card as he promised and calmly left the building with no proof that he was\nthe one to initiate these attacks.\nTh e next morning a call came in to me from the owner describing the carnage\nin the ex-employee’s wake. Hoping for a silver bullet, the client had no choice but\ntry to recover what could be recovered forensically and start over from the backups,\nwhich were more than two months old.\nA disgruntled employee who is left unchecked can be more devastating than\na team of determined and skilled hackers. To the tune of $15 billion USD, that is\nwhat the loss is estimated at being to businesses in the U.S. alone due to employee\ntheft.\nTh ese stories may leave a question about what diff erent categories of social engi-\nneers are out there and whether they can be classifi ed.\nDarkMarket and Master Splynter\nIn 2009 a story broke about an underground group called DarkMarket—the so-\ncalled eBay for criminals, a very tight group that traded stolen credit card numbers\nand identity theft tools, as well as the items needed to make fake credentials and\nmore.\nAn FBI agent by the name of J. Keith Mularski went under deep cover and infi l-\ntrated the DarkMarket site. After a while, Agent Mularski was made an administra-\ntor of the site. Despite many trying to discredit him he hung in for more than three\nyears as the admin of the site.\nDuring this time, Mularski had to live as a malicious hacker, speak and act as one,\nand think as one. His pretext was one of a malicious spammer and he was knowl-\nedgeable enough to pull it off . His pretext and his social engineering skills paid off\nbecause Agent Mularski infi ltrated DarkMarket as the infamous Master Splynter,\nand after three years was essential in shutting down a massive identity theft ring.\nTh e three-year social engineering sting operation netted 59 arrests and prevented\nover $70 million in bank fraud. Th is is just one example of how social engineering\nskills can be used for good.\nThe Different Types of Social Engineers\nAs previously discussed, social engineering can take on many forms. It can be mali-\ncious and it can be friendly, it can build up and it can tear down. Before moving on\nA LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 17\nto the core of this book, take a brief look at the diff erent forms of social engineers\nand a very short description of each:\n» Hackers: Software vendors are becoming more skilled at creating soft-\nware that is hardened, or more diffi cult to break into. As hackers are hit-\nting more hardened software and as software and network attack vectors,\nsuch as remote hacking, are becoming more diffi cult, hackers are turning\nto social engineering skills. Often using a blend of hardware and personal\nskills, hackers are using social engineering in major attacks as well as in\nminor breaches throughout the world.\n» Penetration testers: Since a real-world penetration tester (also known\nas a pentester) is very off ensive in nature, this category must follow after\nhackers. True penetration testers learn and use the skills that the mali-\ncious hackers use to truly help ensure a client’s security. Penetration\ntesters are people who might have the skills of a malicious black hat but\nwho never use the information for personal gain or harm to the target.\n» Spies: Spies use social engineering as a way of life. Often employing\nevery aspect of the social engineering framework (discussed later in this\nchapter), spies are experts in this science. Spies from all around the world\nare taught diff erent methods of “fooling” victims into believing they are\nsomeone or something they are not. In addition to being taught the art of\nsocial engineering, many times spies also build on credibility by knowing\na little or even a lot about the business or government they are trying to\nsocial engineer.\n» Identity thieves: Identity theft is the use of information such as a per-\nson’s name, bank account numbers, address, birth date, and social secu-\nrity number without the owner’s knowledge. Th is crime can range from\nputting on a uniform to impersonating someone to much more elaborate\nscams. Identity thieves employ many aspects of social engineering and as\ntime passes they seem more emboldened and indiff erent to the suff ering\nthey cause.\n» Disgruntled employees: After an employee has become disgruntled,\nthey often enter into an adversarial relationship with their employer. Th is\ncan often be a one-sided situation, because the employee will typically try\nto hide their level of displeasure to not put their employment at risk. Yet\n18 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nthe more disgruntled they become, the easier it becomes to justify acts of\ntheft, vandalism, or other crimes.\n» Scam artist: Scams or cons appeal to greed or other principles that\nattract people’s beliefs and desires to “make a buck.” Scam artists or con\nmen master the ability to read people and pick out little cues that make\na person a good “mark.” Th ey also are skillful at creating situations that\npresent as unbeatable opportunities to a mark.\n» Executive recruiters: Recruiters also must master many aspects of social\nengineering. Having to master elicitation as well as many of the psycho-\nlogical principles of social engineering, they become very adept at not\nonly reading people but also understanding what motivates people. Many\ntimes a recruiter must take into consideration and please not only the job\nseeker but also the job poster.\n» Salespeople: Similar to recruiters, salespeople must master many people\nskills. Many sales gurus say that a good salesperson does not manipulate\npeople but uses their skills to fi nd out what people’s needs are and then\nsees whether they can fi ll it. Th e art of sales takes many skills such as\ninformation gathering, elicitation, infl uence, psychological principles, as\nwell as many other people skills.\n» Governments: Not often looked at as social engineers, governments\nutilize social engineering to control the messages they release as well as\nthe people they govern. Many governments utilize social proof, authority,\nand scarcity to make sure their subjects are in control. Th is type of social\nengineering is not always negative, because some of the messages gov-\nernments relay are for the good of the people and using certain elements\nof social engineering can make the message more appealing and more\nwidely accepted.\n» Doctors, psychologists, and lawyers: Although the people in these\ncareers might not seem like they fi t into the same category as many of\nthese other social engineers, this group employs the same methods used\nby the other groups in this list. Th ey must use elicitation and proper\ninterview and interrogation tactics as well as many if not all of the psy-\nchological principles of social engineering to manipulate their “targets”\n(clients) into the direction they want them to take.\nA LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 19\nRegardless of the fi eld, it seems that you can fi nd social engineering or an aspect\nof it. Th is is why I hold fi rmly to the belief that social engineering is a science. Set\nequations exist that enable a person to “add up” elements of social engineering to\nlead to the goal. In the example of a con man, think of the equation like this: pretext\n+ manipulation + attachment to greed = target being social engineered.\nIn every situation, knowing what elements will work is the hard part, but then\nlearning how to utilize those elements is where the skill comes in. Th is was the basis\nfor thought behind developing the social engineering framework. Th is framework\nhas revolutionized the way social engineering is dissected, as discussed in the next\nsection.\nThe Social Engineering Framework and How to Use It\nTh rough experience and research I have tried to outline the elements that make up\na social engineer. Each of these elements defi nes a part of the equation that equals\na whole social engineer. Th ese aspects are not set in stone; as a matter of fact, from\nits original state until now the framework has grown.\nTh e purpose of the framework is to give enough information for anyone to build\non these skills. Th e framework is not designed to be an all-inclusive resource for\nall information in each chapter. For example, the portion of Chapter 5 that covers\nmicroexpressions is based on the research of some of the greatest minds in this fi eld\nand my experience in using that information. By no means is it meant to replace\nthe 50 years of research by such great minds as Dr. Paul Ekman.\nAs you read through the framework you will see that by utilizing the many skills\nwithin it, you can not only enhance your security practice, but also your mindset\nabout how to remain secure, how to communicate more fully, and how to under-\nstand how people think.\nRefer to the table of contents for a clear picture of the framework or view it\nonline at www.social-engineer.org/framework. At fi rst glance the framework\nmay appear daunting, but inside this book you will fi nd an analysis of each topic\nthat will enable you to apply, enhance, and build these skills.\nKnowledge is power—it is true. In this sense, education is the best defense against\nmost social engineering attacks. Even the ones that knowledge can’t protect 100\npercent against, having details of these attacks keeps you alert. Education can help\nyou enhance your own skills, as well as be alert.\nAlong with education, though, you need practice. Th is book was not designed to\nbe a once-read manual; instead it was designed to be a study guide. You can practice\n20 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nand customize each section for your needs. Th e framework is progressive in the\nsense that it is the way a social engineering attack is laid out. Each section of the\nframework discusses the next topic in the order that a social engineer might utilize\nthat skill in their engagement or planning phases.\nThe framework shows how an attack might be outlined. After the attack is\nplanned out, the skills that are needed can be studied, enhanced, and practiced\nbefore delivery.\nSuppose, for example, that you are planning a social engineering audit against a\ncompany that wanted to see whether you could gain access to its server room and\nsteal data.\nMaybe your plan of attack would be to pretend to be a tech support person who\nneeds access to the server room. You would want to gather information, maybe\neven perform a dumpster dive.\nTh en under the pretext of being the tech guy, you could utilize some covert\ncamera tools as well as practice the proper language and facial/vocal cues for how\nto act, sound, and look like a tech guy.\nIf you locate what company your client uses for tech support you may need to\ndo info gathering on it. Who does your client normally get to service them? What\nare the names of the employees with whom they interact? Th e attack needs to be\nplanned out properly.\nTh is book is not just for those who perform audits, though. Many readers are\ncurious about what the attacks are, not because they are protecting a company, but\nbecause they need to protect themselves. Not being aware of the way a malicious\nsocial engineer thinks can lead someone down the path toward being hacked.\nCollege students in the fi eld of security have also used the framework. Th e infor-\nmation in the framework outlines a realistic path for these vectors, or methods of\nattack, and enables the reader to study them in depth.\nGenerally, this information can also help enhance your ability to communicate\nin everyday life. Knowing how to read facial expressions or how to use questions\nto put people at ease and elicit positive responses can enhance your ability to com-\nmunicate with your family and friends. It can assist you in becoming a good listener\nand more aware of people’s feelings.\nBeing able to read people’s body language, facial expressions, and vocal tones can\nalso enhance your ability to be an eff ective communicator. Understanding how to\nprotect yourself and your loved ones will only make you more valuable and more\naware of the world around you.\nA LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING 21\nSummary\nLike any book, the knowledge contained herein is only useful if you put it into prac-\ntice. Th e more you practice the more you will succeed at mastering these skills.\nPreviously, I discussed how social engineering is like mastering the art of cook-\ning. By mixing the right ingredients in the right quantity you can have a meal that\nis full of fl avor and excitement. Th e fi rst time you try to cook a meal it might have\ntoo much salt or it might lack fl avor altogether, but you don’t immediately throw\nin the towel—you keep trying until you get it right. Th e same goes for social engi-\nneering. Some of the necessary skills may come more naturally to you and others\nmay be more diffi cult.\nIf a particular topic is hard to understand or diffi cult for you to grasp, do not give\nup, and do not assume you cannot learn it. Anyone can learn and use these skills\nwith the right amount of eff ort and work.\nAlso keep in mind that, just like a real recipe, many “ingredients” go into a good\nsocial engineering gig. Th e fi rst ingredient might make more sense after you get\ndown the line a little more. Certain skills—such as “the human buff er overfl ow”\ncovered in Chapter 5—will only make sense after you master some of the other\nskills discussed in this book.\nRegardless, keep practicing and make sure to do extra research on topics for\nwhich you need clarity. Now let’s start cooking. Your “recipe” starts in the next\nchapter with the fi rst ingredient, information gathering.",
    "question": "What are the different categories of social engineers and how do they use social engineering techniques in various contexts?",
    "summary": "Social engineering is a technique that can be used both positively and maliciously to influence people's actions. It involves using social proof, scarcity, and other psychological principles to persuade individuals. The text explores various forms of social engineering, including scams, employee theft, and identity fraud, and explains how these tactics can be applied in different contexts. It also introduces the social engineering framework, which helps in understanding and practicing the skills needed to detect and prevent such attacks."

Those words ring true when it\ncomes to this chapter on information gathering. Even the slightest detail can lead\nto a successful social engineering breach.\nMy good friend and mentor, Mati Aharoni, who has been a professional pentester\nfor more than a decade, tells a story that really drives this point home. He was\ntasked with gaining access to a company that had an almost nonexistent footprint\non the Web. Because the company off ered very few avenues to hack into, gaining\nthis access would prove to be very challenging.\nMati began scouring the Internet for any details that could lead to a path in. In\none of his searches he found a high-ranking company offi cial who used his corporate\nemail on a forum about stamp collecting and who expressed an interest in stamps\nfrom the 1950s. Mati quickly registered a URL, something like www. stampcollection\n.com, and then found a bunch of old-looking 1950 stamp pictures on Google.\nCreating a quick website to show his “stamp collection,” he then crafted an email\nto the company offi cial:\nDear Sir,\nI saw on www.forum.com you are interested in stamps from the\n1950s. Recently my grandfather passed away and left me with a\nstamp collection that I would like to sell. I have a website set up; if\nyou would like to see it please visit www.stampcollection.com.\nThanks,\nMati\n24 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nBefore he sent the email to the target, he wanted to ensure there would be maxi-\nmum impact. He took the offi ce number from the forum post and placed a phone\ncall to the man. “Good morning, sir, this is Bob. I saw your posting on www.forum\n.com. My grandfather recently passed and he left me a bunch of stamps from the\n1950s and 60s. I took pictures and made a website. If you are interested I can send\nyou the link and you can take a look.”\nTh e target was very eager to see this collection and readily accepted the email.\nMati sent the man the email and waited for him to click the link. What Mati did\nwas embed a malicious frame on the website. Th is frame had code in it that would\nexploit a vulnerability then known in the popular Internet Explorer browser and\ngive control over the target’s computer to Mati.\nTh e wait was not long: as soon as the man received the email he clicked the link\nand the company’s perimeter was compromised.\nA tiny piece of information—the corporate email this man used to look for\nstamps—is what led to this compromise. No piece of information is irrelevant.\nWith that knowledge in mind, here are questions that come up with regard to\ninformation gathering:\n» How can you gather information?\n» What sources exist for social engineers to gather information?\n» What can you glean from this information to profi le your targets?\n» How can you locate, store, and catalog all this information for the easiest\nlevel of use?\nTh ese are just a few of the questions that you will need to fi nd answers for in\norder to accomplish proper and eff ective information gathering. With the plethora\nof social networking sites out there, people can easily share every aspect of their lives\nwith anyone they choose, making potentially damaging information more readily\navailable than ever before. Th is chapter focuses on the principles of information\ngathering by presenting examples of how it can be used in social engineering and\nthe devastating eff ects some of the information people release on the Web can have\non their personal and business security.\nMany of the skills or methods that a social engineer may use come from other\nfi elds. One fi eld that is superb at gathering information is sales. Salespeople tend\nto be very talkative, easygoing, and very good at collecting data about those with\nwhom they interact.\nINFORMATION GATHERING 25\nI once read a book on sales in which the author encouraged salespeople to gather\nreferrals from the buyer—something along these lines: “Can you tell me one person\nwho you think could benefi t from this product as much as you will?”\nUsing simple wording can get a person to open up and refer family, friends, and\nmaybe even coworkers. Harvesting, or gathering this information and then storing\nit, allows the sales people to have what they call “warm leads” to call on. A warm\nlead is where they have a person with an “in,” a way to get in the door without hav-\ning to cold call.\nTh e salesperson can now call on those referrals and say something like, “I was just\nat Jane’s house two doors down, and she bought our premium policy. After review-\ning the benefi ts and paying for the year upfront she said you might benefi t from the\nsame coverage. Do you have a minute for me to show you what Jane purchased?”\nTh ese skills used by salespeople are often mirrored by social engineers. Of course\na social engineer is not asking for referrals, but think about the fl ow of information\nin and out of this conversation. Th e salesperson gathers information from his present\nclient, then he relays that information in a way that will make the new “target” more\nsusceptible to listen and let him in. In addition, by dropping hints on what the fi rst\ncustomer bought and using words like “premium” and “in advance” the salesperson\nis preloading the new target with the keywords he wants to use on him in just a little\nwhile. Th is technique is eff ective in that it builds trust, uses familiarity, and allows\nthe target to feel comfortable with the salesperson, or the social engineer, giving\ntheir mind a bridge over the gap that normally would exist there. Th is chapter, as\nwell as the following chapter, will delve deep into these topics.\nAs a social engineer, both angles are of vital importance to understand and then\nto use eff ectively. To return to the illustration used in Chapter 1 of being a chef,\na good chef knows all about how to spot good quality products, fresh vegetables,\nand quality meats. Th ey are knowledgeable about what goes into the recipe, but\nunless the right quantities are used the food may be too bland or too strong or not\ngood enough to eat at all. Simply knowing that a recipe calls for salt doesn’t make\nyou a chef, but knowing how to mix the right amount and types of ingredients can\nhelp you master the art of cooking. A social engineer needs to master the type and\nquantity of skills to be used (the “recipe”). When that is done they can become a\nmaster social engineer.\nTh is chapter helps identify this balance. Th e fi rst ingredient in any recipe for a\nsocial engineer is information (detailed in the next section). Th e higher the quality\n26 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nof the information the more likely you are to achieve success. Th is chapter begins\nby discussing how to gather information. Th en it moves on to discuss what sources\ncan be used to harvest information. Th is chapter would not be complete without\ndiscussing how to tie it all together and utilize these resources as a social engineer.\nGathering Information\nGathering information is like building a house. If you try to start with the roof your\nhouse will surely be a failure. A good house will be built using a solid foundation and\nfrom there it will be built literally from the ground up. As you gather information\nyou may be overwhelmed with how to organize and then use this data, so starting\na fi le or an information gathering service to gather this data in is a good idea.\nMany tools exist to assist in collecting and then using this data. For penetration\ntests and social engineering audits I use a Linux distribution called BackTrack that\nis specifi cally designed for this purpose. BackTrack is like most Linux distributions\nin that it is free and open source. Perhaps its greatest asset is that it contains more\nthan 300 tools designed to assist in security auditing.\nAll of the tools within BackTrack are also open source and free. Especially attrac-\ntive is the high quality of BackTrack’s tools, many of which rival and even surpass\ntools you would pay an arm and a leg for. Two BackTrack tools that are particularly\nuseful for information gathering and storing are called Dradis and BasKet. Th e fol-\nlowing sections take a quick look at each.\nUsing BasKet\nBasKet is similar in functionality to Notepad, but more like Notepad on steroids. It is\npresently maintained by Kelvie Wong and can be found for free either in BackTrack\nor at http://basket.kde.org/. Th e website has full instructions for how to install\nBasKet. Once installed BasKet is easy to use and the interface is not diffi cult to\nunderstand.\nAs seen in Figure 2-1, the interface is easy to fi gure out. Adding a new “Basket”\nto hold data is as simple as right clicking on the left side of the screen and selecting\nNew Basket.\nOnce new Baskets are added the sky is the limit. You can copy and paste data,\nplace screen shots in the Basket, or even tie in OpenOffi ce or other types of charts,\ngraphs, and other utilities.\nINFORMATION GATHERING 27\nFigure 2-1 BasKet allows for easy organization of the data found during information\ngathering.\nAdding a screenshot can be done in a few ways. Th e easiest is to copy the image\nthen right mouse click on the new Basket and click Paste. As shown in Figure 2-1,\nadding images is simple but also shows the image right away. Notes can be typed\nor pasted around the images by simply clicking in the Basket and starting to type.\nIn a normal security audit, what makes BasKet attractive is the way it catalogs\ndata and shows it on the screen. I usually add a diff erent Basket for each type of\ndata such as Whois, social media, and so on. After that, I will do some recon using\nGoogle Maps or Google Earth to capture some images of the client’s building or\nfacility, which I can store in BasKet as well. When the audit is complete, being able\nto pull up and utilize this information quickly is very easy. Figure 2-2 illustrates a\nnearly complete BasKet that contains a lot of useful information and tabs.\nAs shown in Figure 2-2, BasKet is easy to store the information in an easy-to-read\nformat. I try to include as much information as possible because no information\nis too small to store. Th e information I include is items from the client’s website,\nWhoIs information, social media sites, images, employee contact info, resumes\nfound, forums, hobbies, and anything else I fi nd linked to the company.\n28 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFigure 2-2 A nearly completed BasKet with lots of useful information.\nWhen I am done, I simply click on the menu called Basket then Export and export\nthe whole BasKet as an HTML page. Th is is great for reporting or sharing this data.\nFor a social engineer, collecting data, as will be discussed in detail later, is the\ncrux of every gig, but if you cannot recall and utilize the data quickly, it becomes\nuseless. A tool like BasKet makes retaining and utilizing data easy. If you give BasKet\na try and use it once, you will be hooked.\nUsing Dradis\nAlthough BasKet is a great tool, if you do a lot of information gathering, or if you\nwork on team that needs to collect, store, and utilize data, then a tool that allows for\nmulti-user sharing of this data is important. Enter Dradis. According to the creators\nof the open-source Dradis, the program is a “self-contained web application that\nprovides a centralized repository of information” you have gathered, and a means\nby which to plan for what’s to come.\nLike BasKet, Dradis is a free, open-source tool that can be found at http://\ndradisframework.org/. Whether you are using Linux, Windows, or a Mac, Dradis has\neasy-to-use set up and installation instructions found at http://dradisframework\n.org/install.html.\nINFORMATION GATHERING 29\nOnce Dradis is installed and set up, you simply browse to the localhost and port\nyou assigned, or use the standard 3004. You can do this by opening a browser and\ntyping https://localhost:3004/.\nOnce logged in, you’re greeted with the screen shown in Figure 2-3. Notice the\nAdd Branch button at the top left. Adding a branch allows you to add similar details\nas you can in BasKet: notes, images, and more, and you can even import notes.\nFigure 2-3 Dradis has a nice, easy-to-use interface.\nDradis and BasKet are just two tools that I have used to collect and store data.\nTh e websites for both Dradis and BasKet have very nice tutorials on setting up and\nusing these powerful tools.\nWhatever operating system you use—Mac, Windows, or Linux—there are\nchoices out there for you. What is important is to use a tool that you are comfort-\nable with and that can handle large amounts of data.\nFor that reason I suggest staying away from things like Notepad in Windows or\nSmultron or TextEdit in Mac. You want to be able to format and highlight certain\nareas to make them stand out. In my Dradis server, pictured in Figure 2-3, I have\na section for phone scripts. Th is functionality is handy for transcribing ideas that\nmight work based on the information I gathered.\nTh ese tools suggest how a social engineer begins to utilize the information he\ncollects. Th e fi rst stage in utilizing the information you gather is thinking like a\nsocial engineer.\n30 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nThinking Like a Social Engineer\nHaving a few hundred megabytes of data and pictures is great, but when you start\nreviewing it, how do you train yourself to review and then think of the data in a\nway that has maximum impact?\nOf course you could just open a browser and type in long-winded random\nsearches that may lead to some form of information, some of which may even be\nuseful. If you are hungry you probably don’t just run to the kitchen and start to\nthrow whatever ingredients you see into a bowl and start digging in. Planning,\npreparation, and thought all cause the meal to be good. Similar to a real meal, a\nsocial engineer needs to plan, prepare, and think about what information he will\ntry to obtain and how he will obtain it.\nWhen it comes to this vital step of information gathering many people will have\nto change the way they think. You have to approach the world of information in front\nof you with a diff erent opinion and mindset than what you normally may have. You\nhave to learn to question everything, and, when you see a piece of information, learn\nto think of it as a social engineer would. Th e way you ask questions of the web or\nother sources must change. Th e way you view the answers that come back must also\nchange. Overhearing a conversation, reading what seems like a meaningless forum\npost, seeing a bag of trash—you should assimilate this information in a diff erent way\nthan you did before. My mentor Mati gets excited when he sees a program crash.\nWhy? Because he is a penetration tester and exploit writer. A crash is the fi rst step\nto fi nding a vulnerability in software, so instead of being irritated at losing data he\ngets excited at the crash. A social engineer must approach information in much\nthe same way. When fi nding a target that utilizes many diff erent social media sites,\nlook for the links between them and the information that can create a whole profi le.\nAs an example, one time I rented a car to drive a few states away for business.\nMy companion and I loaded all of our luggage in the trunk; as we were entering\nthe car we noticed a small bag of trash in the back seat. Th e other person said\nsomething like, “Service today just stinks. You fi gure for what you pay they would\nat least clean out the car.”\nTrue, you would expect that, but I stopped that bag from just being chucked into\nthe nearest can, and I said, “Let me just look at that really quick.” As I opened the\nbag and pushed aside the Taco Bell wrappers, what was lying in plain sight was a\nshock to me—half of a ripped-up check. I quickly dumped out the bag and found a\nbank receipt and the other half of the check. Th e check was written out for a couple\nthousand dollars, then just ripped up—not into tiny little pieces, but just into four\nINFORMATION GATHERING 31\nlarge chunks, then thrown into a small bag with a Taco Bell wrapper. Taping it back\ntogether revealed this person’s name, company name, address, phone number, bank\naccount number, and bank routing number. Together with the bank receipt I now\nhad the balance of his account. Th ankfully for him I am not a malicious person\nbecause only a couple more steps are needed to commit identity theft.\nTh is story personifi es how people view their valuable information. Th is guy\nrented the car before me and then because he threw the check away he felt it was\ngone, disposed of safely. Or so he thought; but this is not an isolated case. At this\nURL you can fi nd a recent story about very valuable things people just threw away\nor sold for next to nothing at a garage sale: www.social-engineer.org/wiki/\narchives/BlogPosts/LookWhatIFound.html.\nTh ings like:\n» A painting that a museum bought for $1.2 million\n» 1937 Bugatti Type 57S Atalante with a mere 24,000 miles sold for $3\nmillion\n» A copy of the Declaration of Independence\nIf people throw away a painting with a hidden copy of the Declaration of\nIndependence in it, then throwing away bills, medical records, old invoices, or credit\ncard statements probably isn’t such a huge deal.\nHow you interact with people in public can have devastating eff ects. In the fol-\nlowing scenario I was asked to audit a company and before I could proceed I needed\nto gather some data. Take a look at how simple, seemingly meaningless information\ncan lead to a breach.\nSimply following one of the higher ups of the target company for a day or two\nshowed me that he stopped for coff ee every morning at the same time. Since I was\naware of his 7:30 a.m. coff ee stop at the local coff ee shop I could plan a “meeting.”\nHe would sit for 30–35 minutes, read the paper, and drink a medium cafe latte. I\nenter the shop about 3–5 minutes after he sits down. I order the same drink as him\nand sit down next to him in the shop. I look over as he places one section of the\npaper down and ask whether I can read the paper he is done with. Having already\npicked up a paper on the way I knew that page three contained an article about a\nrecent murder in the area. After acting as if I just read it, I say out loud, “Even in\nthese small towns things are scary nowadays. You live around here?”\nNow at this point the target can blow me off , or if I played my cards right, my body\nlanguage, vocal tone, and appearance will put him at ease. He says, “Yeah, I moved\nin a few years back for a job. I like small towns, but you hear this more and more.”\n32 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nI continue, “I am just traveling through the area. I sell high-end business con-\nsulting services to large companies and always enjoy traveling through the smaller\ntowns but I seem to hear more and more of these stories even in the rural areas.”\nTh en in a very joking tone I say, “You don’t happen to be a bigwig in a large company\nthat needs some consulting do you?”\nHe laughs it off and then as if I just challenged him to prove his worth says, “Well\nI am a VP of fi nance at XYZ Corp. here locally, but I don’t handle that department.”\n“Hey, look, I am not trying to sell you something, just enjoy coff ee, but if you\nthink I can stop by and leave you some information tomorrow or Wednesday?”\nTh is is where the story gets interesting, as he says, “Well I would but I am head-\ning out for a much-needed vacation on Wednesday. But why don’t you mail it to me\nand I will call you.” He then hands me a card.\n“Going somewhere warm and sunny, I hope?” I ask this knowing that I am prob-\nably getting close to my point where I need to cut it off .\n“Taking the wife on a cruise south.” I can tell he doesn’t want to tell me where,\nwhich is fi ne, so we shake hands and part ways.\nNow could he have been blowing me off ? Probably, but I have some valuable\ninformation:\n» His direct number\n» When he is leaving for vacation\n» What type of vacation\n» Th at he is local\n» Th e name of his company\n» His title in his company\n» Th at he recently relocated\nOf course, some of this information I already had from previous information\ngathering, but I was able to add a substantial amount to it after this meeting. Now\nto launch the next part of the attack, I call his direct line the day after he is supposed\nto be gone and ask for him, only to be told by his receptionist, “Sorry, Mr. Smith is\non vacation—can I take a message?”\nExcellent. Th e information is verifi ed and now all I need to do is launch the\nfi nal phase, which means dressing up in a suit and taking my $9 business cards to\nhis offi ce. I enter, sign in, and tell the receptionist I have an appointment with Mr.\nSmith at 10:00 a.m. To which she replies, “He is on vacation, are you sure it is today?”\nINFORMATION GATHERING 33\nUsing my practice sessions on microexpressions, a topic addressed in Chapter 5,\nI show true surprise: “Wait, his cruise was this week? I thought he left next week.”\nNow this statement is vital—why?\nI want the appointment to be believable and I want the receptionist to trust me\nby proxy. By stating I know about his cruise this must mean Mr. Smith and I have\nhad intimate conversation—enough so that I know his itinerary. But my helplessness\nelicits pity and right away the secretary comes to my aid. “Oh, honey, I am sorry, do\nyou want me to call his assistant?”\n“Ah, no.” I reply. “I really wanted to leave some information with him. How about\nthis—I will just leave it with you and you can give it to him when he gets back? I am\nterribly embarrassed; maybe you can avoid even telling him I did this?”\n“My lips are sealed.”\n“Th ank you. Look I am going to crawl out of here, but before I do can I just use\nyour bathroom?” I know that I normally would not be buzzed in, but I hope the\ncombination of my rapport, my helplessness, and their pity will lead to success—and\nit does.\nWhile in the bathroom, I place an envelope in one stall. On the cover of the\nenvelope I put a sticker that says PRIVATE. Inside the “private” envelope is a USB\nkey with a malicious payload on it. I do this in one stall and also in the hallway by\na break room to increase my chances and hope that the person that fi nds one of\nthem is curious enough to insert it into their computer.\nSure enough, this method seems to always work. Th e scary thing is that this\nattack probably wouldn’t work if it weren’t for a useless little conversation in a cof-\nfee shop.\nTh e point is not only about how small data can still lead to a breach, but also how\nyou collect this data. Th e sources that you can use to collect data are important to\nunderstand and test until you are profi cient with each method and each source of\ncollection. Th ere are many diff erent types of sources for collecting data. A good\nsocial engineer must be prepared to spend some time learning the strengths and\nweaknesses of each as well as the best way to utilize each source. Th us the topic of\nthe next section.\nSources for Information Gathering\nMany diff erent sources exist for information gathering. Th e following list cannot\npossibly cover every source out there, but it does outline the major choices you have.\n34 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nGathering Information from Websites\nCorporate and/or personal websites can provide a bounty of information. Th e fi rst\nthing a good social engineer will often do is gather as much data as he can from\nthe company’s or person’s website. Spending some quality time with the site can\nlead to clearly understanding:\n» What they do\n» Th e products and services they provide\n» Physical locations\n» Job openings\n» Contact numbers\n» Biographies on the executives or board of directors\n» Support forum\n» Email naming conventions\n» Special words or phrases that can help in password profi ling\nSeeing people’s personal websites is also amazing because they will link to almost\nevery intimate detail about their lives—kids, houses, jobs, and more. Th is informa-\ntion should be cataloged into sections because it will often be something from this\nlist that is used in the attack.\nMany times company employees will be part of the same forums, hobby lists,\nor social media sites. If you fi nd one employee on LinkedIn or Facebook, chances\nare that many more are there as well. Trying to gather all that data can really help\na social engineer profi le the company as well as the employees. Many employees\nwill talk about their job title in their social media outlets. Th is can help a social\nengineer to profi le how many people may be in a department and how the depart-\nments are structured.\nSearch Engines\nJohnny Long wrote a famous book called Google Hacking for Penetration Testers\nand really opened up many people’s eyes to the amazing amount of information\nthat Google holds.\nGoogle forgives but it never forgets, and it has been compared to the Oracle.\nAs long as you know how to ask, it can tell you most anything you want to know.\nJohnny developed a list of what he calls “Google Dorks,” or a string that can be\nused to search in Google to fi nd out information about a company. For example if\nINFORMATION GATHERING 35\nyou were to type in: site:microsoft.com fi letype:pdf you would be given a list of\nevery fi le with the extension of PDF that is on the microsoft.com domain.\nBeing familiar with search terms that can help you locate fi les on your target\nis a very important part of information gathering. I make a habit of searching for\nfi letype:pdf, fi letype:doc, fi letype:xls, and fi letype:txt. It is also a good idea to\nsee if employees actually leave fi les like DAT, CFG, or other database or confi gura-\ntion fi les open on their servers to be harvested.\nEntire books are dedicated to the topic of using Google to fi nd data, but the\nmain thing to remember is learning about Google’s operands will help you develop\nyour own.\nA website like www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators.html has a very\nnice list of both the operands and how to use them.\nGoogle is not the only search engine that reveals amazing information. A researcher\nnamed John Matherly created a search engine he called Shodan (www.shodanhq.com).\nShodan is unique in that it searches the net for servers, routers, specifi c software,\nand so much more. For example, a search of microsoft-iis os:“windows 2003” reveals\nthe following number of servers running Windows 2003 with Microsoft IIS:\n» United States 59,140\n» China 5,361\n» Canada 4,424\n» United Kingdom 3,406\n» Taiwan 3,027\nTh is search is not target-specifi c, but it does demonstrate one vital lesson: the\nweb contains an amazing wealth of information that needs to be tapped by a social\nengineer seeking to become profi cient at information gathering.\nWhois Reconnaissance\nWhois is a name for a service and a database. Whois databases contain a wealth\nof information that in some cases can even contain full contact information of the\nwebsite administrators.\nUsing a Linux command prompt or using a website like www.whois.net can lead\nyou to surprisingly specifi c results like such as a person’s email address, telephone\nnumber, or even DNS server IP address.\nWhois information can be very helpful in profi ling a company and fi nding out\ndetails about their servers. All of this information can be used for further informa-\ntion gathering or to launch social engineering attacks.\n36 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nPublic Servers\nA company’s publicly reachable servers are also great sources for what its websites\ndon’t say. Fingerprinting a server for its OS, installed applications, and IP informa-\ntion can say a great deal about a company’s infrastructure. After you determine the\nplatform and applications in use, you could combine this data with a search on the\ncorporate domain name to fi nd entries on public support forums.\nIP addresses may tell you whether the servers are hosted locally or with a provider;\nwith DNS records you can determine server names and functions, as well as IPs.\nIn one audit after searching the web using the tool called Maltego (discussed\nin Chapter 7), I was able to uncover a publicly facing server that housed literally\nhundreds of documents with key pieces of information about projects, clients, and\nthe creators of those documents. Th is information was devastating to the company.\nAn important note to keep in mind is that performing a port scan—using a\ntool like NMAP or another scanner to locate open ports, software, and operating\nsystems used on a public server—can lead to problems with the law in some areas.\nFor example, in June 2003, an Israeli, Avi Mizrahi, was accused by the Israeli\npolice of the off ense of attempting the unauthorized access of computer material.\nHe had port scanned the Mossad website. About eight months later, he was acquit-\nted of all charges. Th e judge even ruled that these kinds of actions should not be\ndiscouraged when they are performed in a positive way (www.law.co.il/media/\ncomputer-law/mizrachi_en.pdf).\nIn December 1999, Scott Moulton was arrested by the FBI and accused of\nattempted computer trespassing under Georgia’s Computer Systems Protection\nAct and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of America. At the time, his IT service\ncompany had an ongoing contract with the Cherokee County of Georgia to maintain\nand upgrade the 911 center security (www.securityfocus.com/news/126).\nAs part of his work, Moulton performed several port scans on Cherokee County\nservers to check their security and eventually port scanned a web server monitored\nby another IT company. Th is provoked a lawsuit, although he was acquitted in\n2000. Th e judge ruled that no damage occurred that would impair the integrity\nand availability of the network.\nIn 2007 and 2008, England, France, and Germany passed laws that make unlawful\nthe creation, distribution, and possession of materials that allow someone to break\nany computer law. Port scanners fall under this description.\nOf course, if you are involved in a paid audit of a company most of this will be in\nthe contract, but it is important to state that it is up to the social engineer auditor\nto be aware of the local laws and make sure you are not breaking them.\nINFORMATION GATHERING 37\nSocial Media\nMany companies have recently embraced social media. It’s cheap marketing that\ntouches a large number of potential customers. It’s also another stream of infor-\nmation from a company that can provide breadcrumbs of viable information.\nCompanies publish news on events, new products, press releases, and stories that\nmay relate them to current events.\nLately, social networks have taken on a mind of their own. When one becomes\nsuccessful it seems that a few more pop up that utilize similar technology. With sites\nlike Twitter, Blippy, PleaseRobMe, ICanStalkU, Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, and\nothers, you can fi nd information about people’s lives and whereabouts in the wide\nopen. Later, this book will discuss this topic in much more depth and you will see\nthat social networks are amazing sources of information.\nUser Sites, Blogs, and So On\nUser sites such as blogs, wikis, and online videos may provide not only informa-\ntion about the target company, but also off er a more personal connection through\nthe user(s) posting the content. A disgruntled employee who’s blogging about his\ncompany’s problems may be susceptible to a sympathetic ear from someone with\nsimilar opinions or problems. Either way, users are always posting amazing amounts\nof data on the web for anyone to see and read.\nCase in point: Take a look at a new site that has popped up—www.icanstalku\n.com (see Figure 2-4). Contrary to its name, it does not encourage people to actually\nstalk others. Th is site points to the complete thoughtlessness of many Twitter users.\nIt scrapes the Twitter site and looks for users who are silly enough to post pictures\nusing their smart phones. Many people do not realize that most smart phones embed\nGPS location data in their photos. When a user posts a picture to the web with this\ndata embedded it can lead a person right to their location.\nDisplaying location-based information is a scary aspect of social media websites.\nNot only do they allow you to post pictures of yourself, they also implicitly reveal\nyour location—possibly without your knowledge.\nSites like ICanStalkU underscore the danger of this information. Check out a\nstory (one of many) that shows how this data is used for home break-ins, robberies,\nand sometimes more at www.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/BlogPosts/\nTwitterHomeRobbery.html.\nTh is type of information can give you a very detailed profi le of your target.\nPeople love to tweet about where they are, what they are doing, and who they are\nwith. Blippy allows a person to connect their bank accounts and in essence it will\n38 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n“tweet” with each purchase, where it was from, and how much it costs. With pic-\ntures including embedded location data and then sites like Facebook, which many\nuse to put personal pictures, stories, and other related info, it is a social engineer’s\ndream. In a short while a whole profi le can be developed with a person’s address,\njob, pictures, hobbies, and more.\nAnother aspect of social media sites that makes them excellent sources of infor-\nmation gathering is the ability to be anonymous. If the target is a recently divorced\nmiddle-aged man who loves his Facebook page, you can be a young woman who is\nlooking for a new friend. Many times, while fl irting, people divulge valuable pieces\nof information. Combine the ability to be anyone or anything you want on the web\nwith the fact that most people believe everything they read as gospel fact and what\nyou have is one of the greatest risks to security.\nFigure 2-4 A typical scene on the homepage of ICanStalkU.com.\nINFORMATION GATHERING 39\nPublic Reports\nPublic data may be generated by entities inside and outside the target company. Th is\ndata can consist of quarterly reports, government reports, analyst reports, earnings\nposted for publicly traded companies, and so on. An example of these are Dunn\nand Bradstreet reports or other sales reports that are sold for very little money and\ncontain a lot of details on the target company.\nAnother avenue discussed in more detail later is using background checkers such\nas those found at www.USSearch.com and www.intelius.com. Th ese sites, along with\nmany others, can off er background check services for as little as $1 for one limited\nreport to a $49 per month fee that lets you run as many checks as you want. You can\nget much of this information for free using search engines, but some of the detailed\nfi nancial data and personal information can only be obtained easily and legally\nthrough a paid-for service. Perhaps most shocking is that many of these companies\nmay even provide data like a person’s Social Security Number to some customers.\nUsing the Power of Observation\nTh ough not used enough as a social engineering tool, simple observation can tell\nyou much about your target. Does the target’s employees use keys, RFID cards, or\nother methods to enter the building? Is there a designated area for smoking? Are\ndumpsters locked, and does the building have external cameras? External devices\nsuch as power supplies or air conditioning units usually reveal who the service\ncompany is, and that can allow the social engineer another vector to gain access.\nTh ese are just a few of the questions that you can get answers for through obser-\nvation. Taking some time to watch the target, fi lm using a covert camera, and then\nstudying and analyzing the information later can teach you a lot and give your\ninformation fi le a major boost.\nGoing through the Garbage\nYes, as hard as it is to imagine enjoying jumping through the trash, it can yield one\nof the most lucrative payoff s for information gathering. People often throw away\ninvoices, notices, letters, CDs, computers, USB keys, and a plethora of other devices\nand reports that can truly give amazing amounts of information. As mentioned\npreviously, if people are willing to throw away art that is worth millions, then things\nthey view as trash will often go without a second thought, right into the garbage.\n40 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nSometimes companies shred documents they deem as too important to just\nthrow out, but they use an ineffi cient shredder that leaves paper too easy to put\nback together, as shown in Figure 2-5.\nFigure 2-5 Large one-way shreds leave some words still readable.\nTh is image shows a few documents after shredding, but some whole words are\nstill discernable. Th is type of shredding can be thwarted with a little time and\npatience and some tape, as seen in Figure 2-6. Documents that can be even partially\ntaped back together can reveal some very devastating information.\nFigure 2-6 Putting documents back together only takes time and patience.\nHowever, using a shredder that shreds both directions into a fi ne minced mess\nmakes taping documents back together nearly impossible, as shown in Figure 2-7.\nINFORMATION GATHERING 41\nFigure 2-7. You can hardly tell this was once money.\nMany companies use commercial services that take their shredded documents\naway for incineration. Some companies even leave the shredding to a third party,\nwhich, as you probably guessed, leaves them open to another attack vector. A social\nengineer who fi nds out the name of their vendor for this can easily mimic the pickup\nperson and be handed all their documents. Nevertheless, dumpster diving can off er\na quick way to fi nd all the information you want. Remember some key pointers when\nperforming a dumpster dive:\n» Wear good shoes or boots: Nothing will ruin your day faster than\njumping in a dumpster and having a nail go through your foot. Make sure\nyour shoes tie on nice and tight as well as off er protection from sharp\nobjects.\n» Wear dark clothing: Th is doesn’t need much explanation. You prob-\nably want to wear clothes you don’t mind having to get rid of, and dark\nclothes to avoid being detected.\n» Bring a fl ashlight\n» Grab and run: Unless you are in such a secluded area that you have no\nchance of being caught, grabbing some bags and going elsewhere to rum-\nmage through them might be best.\nDumpster diving almost always leads to some very useful information.\nSometimes a social engineer doesn’t even have to dive into a dumpster to fi nd the\ngoods. Already mentioned in Chapter 1 is the article found at www.social-engineer\n.org/resources/book/TopSecretStolen.htm, but it solidifi es this thought. Th e\nCanadian CTU (Counter-Terrorism Unit) had plans for a new building that outlined\n42 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nits security cameras, fences, and other top-secret items. Th ese blueprints were just\nthrown away—yes, just tossed in the trash, not even shredded, and fortunately\nfound by a friendly person.\nTh is story is just one of many that show “the height of stupidity,” as the article\nstated, but from a social engineer’s point of view, trash diving is one of the best\ninformation gathering tools out there.\nUsing Profiling Software\nChapter 7 discusses the tools that make up some of the professional toolsets of\nsocial engineers, but this section off ers a quick overview.\nPassword profi lers such as Common User Passwords Profi ler (CUPP) and Who’s\nYour Daddy (WYD) can help a social engineer profi le the potential passwords a\ncompany or person may use.\nHow to use these tools is discussed in Chapter 7, but a tool like WYD will scrape\na person or company’s website and create a password list from the words mentioned\non that site. It is not uncommon for people to use words, names, or dates as pass-\nwords. Th ese types of software make it easy to create lists to try.\nAmazing tools such as Maltego (see Chapter 7 for more details), made by Paterva,\nare an information gatherer’s dream. Maltego allows a social engineer to perform\nmany web-based and passive information gathering searches without having to use\nany utilities but Maltego itself.\nTh en it will store and graph this data on the screen to be used in reporting,\nexporting or other purposes. This can really help in developing a profile on a\ncompany.\nRemember, your goal as you collect data is to learn about the target company\nand the people within the company. Once a social engineer collects enough data,\na clear picture will form in their minds as to the best way to manipulate the data\nfrom the targets. You want to profi le the company as a whole and fi nd out roughly\nhow many employees are part of some club, a hobby, or group. Do they donate to\na certain charity or do their kids go to the same school? All of this information is\nvery helpful in developing a profi le.\nA clear profi le can help the social engineer not only in developing a good pretext,\nbut can also outline what questions to use, what are good or bad days to call or come\nonsite as well as many other clues that can make the job so much easier.\nAll of the methods discussed so far are mostly physical, very personal methods\nof information gathering. I didn’t touch on the very technical side of information\nINFORMATION GATHERING 43\ngathering like services such as SMTP, DNS, Netbios, and the almighty SNMP. I do\ncover some of the more technical aspects that Maltego can help with in Chapter 7\nin more detail. Th ese methods are worth looking into but are very much technical\nin nature as opposed to more “human” in nature.\nWhatever the method you utilize to gather information logically, the question\nthat may come up is now that you know where to gather, how to gather, and even\nhow to catalog, store, and display this info, what do you do with it?\nAs a social engineer, after you have information you must start planning your\nattacks. To do that you need to start modeling an outline that will use this informa-\ntion. One of the best ways to start utilizing this data is to develop what is called a\ncommunication model.\nCommunication Modeling\nTh e more elaborate our means of communication,\nthe less we communicate.\n—Joseph Priestley\nCommunication is a process of transferring information from one entity to another.\nCommunication entails interactions between at least two agents, and can be per-\nceived as a two-way process in which there is an exchange of information and a pro-\ngression of thoughts, feelings, or ideas toward a mutually accepted goal or direction.\nTh is concept is very similar to the defi nition of social engineering, except the\nassumption is that those involved in the communication already have a common\ngoal, whereas the goal of the social engineer is to use communication to create a\ncommon goal. Communication is a process whereby information is enclosed in a\npackage and is channeled and imparted by a sender to a receiver via some medium.\nTh e receiver then decodes the message and gives the sender feedback. All forms\nof communication require a sender, a message, and a receiver. Understanding how\ncommunication works is essential to developing a proper communication model as\na social engineer. Modeling your communication as a social engineer will help us\nto decide the best method of delivery, the best method for feedback, and the best\nmessage to include.\nCommunication can take many diff erent forms. Th ere are auditory means, such\nas speech, song, and tone of voice, and there are nonverbal means, such as body\nlanguage, sign language, paralanguage, touch, and eye contact.\n44 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nRegardless of the type of communication used, the message and how it is deliv-\nered will have a defi nite eff ect on the receiver.\nUnderstanding the basic ground rules is essential to building a model for a target.\nSome rules cannot be broken, such as communication always has a sender and a\nreceiver. Also everyone has diff erent personal realities that are built and aff ected\nby their past experiences and their perceptions.\nEveryone perceives, experiences, and interprets things diff erently based on these\npersonal realities. Any given event will always be perceived diff erently by diff erent\npeople because of this fact. If you have siblings, a neat exercise to prove this is to\nask them their interpretation or memory of an event, especially if it is an emotional\nevent. You will see that their interpretation of this event is very diff erent from what\nyou remember.\nEach person has both a physical and a mental personal space. You allow or disal-\nlow people to enter that space or get close to you depending on many factors. When\ncommunicating with a person in any fashion, you are trying to enter their personal\nspace. As a social engineer communicates they are trying to bring someone else\ninto their space and share that personal reality. Eff ective communication attempts\nto bring all participants into each other’s mental location. Th is happens with all\ninteractions, but because it is so common people do it without thinking about it.\nIn interpersonal communications two layers of messages are being sent: verbal\nand nonverbal.\nCommunication usually contains a verbal or language portion, whether it is in\nspoken, written, or expressed word. It also usually has a nonverbal portion—facial\nexpressions, body language, or some non-language message like emoticons or fonts.\nRegardless of the amount of each type of cue (verbal or nonverbal), this com-\nmunication packet is sent to the receiver and then fi ltered through her personal\nreality. She will form a concept based on her reality, then based on that will start\nto interpret this packet. As the receiver deciphers this message she begins to\nunscramble its meaning, even if that meaning is not what the sender intended.\nTh e sender will know whether his packet is received the way he intended if the\nreceiver gives a communication packet in return to indicate her acceptance or\ndenial of the original packet.\nHere the packet is the form of communication: the words or letters or emails\nsent. When the receiver gets the message she has to decipher it. Many factors\ndepend on how it is interpreted. Is she in a good mood, bad mood, happy, sad,\nINFORMATION GATHERING 45\nangry, compassionate—all of these things as well as the other cues that alter her\nperception will help her to decipher that message.\nTh e social engineer’s goal has to be to give both the verbal and nonverbal cues\nthe advantage to alter the target’s perception so as to have the impact the social\nengineer desires.\nSome more basic rules for communication include the following:\n» Never take for granted that the receiver has the same reality as you.\n» Never take for granted that the receiver will interpret the message the\nway it was intended.\n» Communication is not an absolute, fi nite thing.\n» Always assume as many diff erent realities exist as there are diff erent\npeople involved in the communication.\nKnowing these rules can greatly enhance the ability for good and useful commu-\nnications. Th is is all good and great but what does communication have to do with\ndeveloping a model? Even more, what does it have to do with social engineering?\nThe Communication Model and Its Roots\nAs already established, communication basically means sending a packet of informa-\ntion to an intended receiver. Th e message may come from many sources like sight,\nsound, touch, smell, and words. Th is packet is then processed by the target and\nused to paint an overall picture of “What’s being said.” Th is method of assessment\nis called the communication process. Th is process was originally outlined by social\nscientists Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver in 1947, when they developed the\nShannon-Weaver model, also known as “the mother of all models.”\nTh e Shannon-Weaver model, according to Wikipedia, “embodies the concepts\nof information source, message, transmitter, signal, channel, noise, receiver, infor-\nmation destination, probability of error, coding, decoding, information rate, [and]\nchannel capacity,” among other things.\nShannon and Weaver defi ned this model with a graphic, as shown in Figure 2-8.\nIn a simple model, also known as the transmission model, information or con-\ntent is sent in some form from a sender to a destination or receiver. Th is common\nconcept of communication simply views communication as a means of sending\nand receiving information. Th e strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality,\nand quantifi ability.\n46 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nM e s s a g e Noise\nSource\nInformation\nTransmitter Receiver Destination\nSource\nReceived\nSignal\nSignal M e s s a g e\nFigure 2-8 The Shannon-Weaver “mother of all models.”\nShannon and Weaver structured this model based on:\n» An information source, which produces a message\n» A transmitter, which encodes the message into signals\n» A channel, to which signals are adapted for transmission\n» A receiver, which “decodes” (reconstructs) the message from the signal\n» A destination, where the message arrives\nTh ey argued that three levels of problems for communication existed within\nthis theory:\n» Th e technical problem—How accurately can the message be transmitted?\n» Th e semantic problem—How precisely is the meaning conveyed?\n» Th e eff ectiveness problem—How eff ectively does the received meaning\naff ect behavior? (Th is last point is important to remember for social engi-\nneering. Th e whole goal of the social engineer is to create a behavior that\nthe social engineer wants.)\nAlmost 15 years later, David Berlo expanded on Shannon and Weaver’s lin-\near model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver\n(SMCR) model of communication. SMCR separated the model into clear parts, as\nshown in Figure 2-9.\nINFORMATION GATHERING 47\nS M C R\nSOURCE MESSAGE CHANNEL RECEIVER\nComm Skills Elements Structure Seeing Comm Skills\nAttitudes Hearing Attitudes\nC\no\nC\nKnowledge n Touching Knowledge\no\nt\nd\nSocial System n e Treatment e Smelling Social System\nt\nCulture Tasting Culture\nFigure 2-9 The Berlo model.\nYou can think of communication as processes of information transmission gov-\nerned by three levels of rules:\n» Formal properties of signs and symbols\n» Th e relations between signs/expressions and their users\n» Th e relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent\nTh erefore, you can further refi ne the defi nition of communication as social\ninteraction where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and\na common set of rules.\nIn 2008 another researcher, D. C. Balmund, combined the research of many of\nhis previous cohorts with his own and developed the transactional model of com-\nmunication, as shown in Figure 2-10.\nIn this model you can see that the channel and message can take on many forms,\nnot just spoken, as represented by the picture. Th e message can be in written, video,\nor audio form and the receiver can be one person or many people. Th e feedback\nalso can take on many forms.\nCombining and analyzing this research can help a social engineer develop a solid\ncommunication model. Not only social engineers can benefi t from doing this—\neveryone can. Learning how to develop a plan of communication can enhance the\nway you deal with your spouse, your kids, your employer or employees—anyone\nyou communicate with.\n48 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nSource\nReceivers\nFigure 2-10 The new and improved communication model.\nBecause the focus of this book is social engineers, you need to analyze what a\nsocial engineer can take away from all of this. After reading all this theory you\nmay begin to wonder how this can be used. Remember, a social engineer must be\na master at communication. Th ey must be able to eff ectively enter into and remain\nin a person’s personal and mental space and not off end or turn off the target.\nDeveloping, implementing, and practicing eff ective communication models is the\nkey to accomplishing this goal. Th e next step then is developing a communication\nmodel.\nDeveloping a Communication Model\nNow that you know about the key elements of a communication model, take a look\nat them from the eyes of a social engineer:\n» Th e Source: Th e social engineer is the source of the information or com-\nmunication that is going to be relayed.\n» Th e Channel: Th is is the method of delivery.\n» Th e Message: Probably the biggest part of the message is knowing what\nyou are going to say to the receiver(s).\nINFORMATION GATHERING 49\n» Th e Receiver(s): Th is is the target.\n» Th e Feedback: What do you want them to do after you eff ectively give\nthem the communication?\nHow can you use these elements eff ectively? Th e fi rst step into the world of com-\nmunication modeling is starting with your goal. Try working with a couple of the\nscenarios that might be part of a typical social engineering gig:\n» Develop a phishing email targeted against 25–50 employees and attempt\nto have them go during work hours to a non-business website that will be\nembedded with malicious code to hack into their networks.\n» Make an onsite visit to portray a potential interviewee who has just\nruined his resume by spilling coff ee on it and needs to convince the\nfront-desk person to allow a USB key to be inserted into a computer to\nprint a copy of the resume.\nWhen developing a communication strategy you may fi nd working on the model\nin reverse order to be benefi cial.\n» Feedback: What is your desired response? Th e desired response is to\nhave the majority of the employees you send this email to click on it.\nTh at is ideal; of course, you might be happy with just a handful or even\none, but the goal, the desired feedback, is to have the majority of targets\nclick on the phishing link.\n» Receivers: Th is is where your information gathering skills come in\nhandy. You need to know all about the targets. Do they like sports? Are\nthey predominantly male or female? Are they members of local clubs?\nWhat do they do in their off time? Do they have families? Are they older\nor younger? Th e answers to these questions can help the social engineer\ndecide what type of message to send.\n» Message: If the target is predominantly 25–40-year-old males, with a\nfew being part of a fantasy football or basketball league, your targets may\nclick on a link about sports, women, or a sporting event. Developing the\nemail’s content is essential, but also grammar, spelling, and punctuation\nare very important to consider. One of the biggest tip-off s to phishing\nemails in the past has been the bad spelling.\nGetting an email that reads like this: “Click here and enter ur pas-\nword to verify ur account settings,” is a dead giveaway to its being a\n50 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nnon-legitimate email. Your email must be legit with good spelling and an\nappealing offer that fits the target. Even with the same goal the message\nwill change depending on gender, age, and many other factors. The same\nemail would probably fail if the targets were predominately female.\n» Channel: Th is answer to this element is easy, because you already know\nit is going to be an email.\n» Source: Again, this element is a no-brainer, because you, the social engi-\nneer, are the source. How believable you are depends on your skill level\nas a social engineer.\nScenario One: Phishing Email\nThe targets are 45 males ranging from the age of 25 to 45. Out of the 45 tar-\ngets, 24 are in the same fantasy basketball league. Th ey all go daily to a site (www\n.m yfantasybasketballleague.com) to register their picks. Th is is verifi ed by posts\non the forums.\nThe goal is to drive them to a site that is available and that you now own,\nwww.myfantasybasketballeague.com, which is a slight misspelling. Th is site is a\nclone of the site they visit with one change—it has an embedded iframe. Th ere will\nbe a Login button in the center of the page that when clicked, brings them back to\nthe real site. Th e delay in loading and clicking will give the code the time it needs\nto hack their systems.\nHow would you write the email? Here is a sample that I wrote:\nHello,\nWe have some exciting news at My Fantasy Basket Ball League. We\nhave added some additional features that will allow you more con-\ntrol over your picks as well as some special features. We are work-\ning hard on offering this to all of our members but some additional\nservice fees may apply.\nWe are excited to say that the first 100 people to log in will get this\nnew service for free. Click this link to be taken to the special page,\nclick the gray LOGIN button on the page, and log in to have these\nfeatures added to your account. www.myfantasybasketballeague.com\nThanks,\nThe MFBB Team\nINFORMATION GATHERING 51\nTh is email would mostly likely get at least the 24 who are already in the league\ninterested enough to click the link and check out the site and try these new features\nfor free.\nAnalyze that email. First, it contains an off er that would attract the present mem-\nbers of that fantasy league. Many of them realize the off er is limited to only the fi rst\n100, so they would click on it soon as they get the email, which more than likely is\nat work. Th e site that the email drives them to has the malicious code and although\nthe majority will fall victim, all the malicious social engineer needs is one victim.\nAlso notice that the email contains good grammar and spelling, an enticing\nhook, and enough motivation to click quickly. It is a perfect email based off a solid\ncommunication model.\nScenario Two: USB Key\nTh e onsite scenario is a little more diffi cult to do because it is in person. You can\nonly do so much to “spoof” your identity in person. In this scenario remember that\nyou must have all these details in memory because you can’t be pulling out and\nusing cue cards. It is also important to remember that oftentimes we have only one\nchance to make an impression. If we do a bad job at it, it can ruin the rest of the gig.\n» Feedback: Th e goal with this scenario is to get the front desk reception-\nist to accept your USB drive that has a malicious program on it. Th e\nprogram will auto load and scrape her system for all information, such\nas usernames, passwords, email accounts, SAM fi les that contain all the\npasswords on the system, and more, copying it all to a directory on the\nUSB drive. It also creates a reverse connection from the receptionist’s\nmachine to your servers, giving you access to her machine and hope-\nfully the network. I am fond of using the Metasploit framework or the\nSocial Engineering Toolkit (see Chapter 7) that ties in with Metasploit.\nMetasploit executes exploit code on its victims and it has a built-in han-\ndler called Meterpreter. Th e user can script many things like keylogging,\nscreenshots, and recon from the victim’s machines.\n» Receivers: Having one true target can be tricky because if your target is\nunreceptive to the idea, your plan is shot. You must be warm, friendly,\nand convincing. Th is must be done fast, too, because too much time will\nallow doubt to set in. But if you move too fast you can cause doubt and\nfear, killing your chances. A perfect balance must be accomplished.\n52 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Message: Because you’re delivering the message in person, it must be\nclear and concise. Th e basic story is that you saw the ad in the paper for\na database administrator and you called in and spoke to Debbie, the HR\nperson. She said she was booked today but you should stop in and drop\noff a resume for her review and then meet her at the end of the week.\nWhile you were driving over, a squirrel ran out, causing you to slam on\nthe brakes and causing your coff ee to come out of the holder and spill\nin your bag, ruining your resumes and other stuff . Anyhow, you have\nanother appointment but really need this job and wonder whether she\nwould print you a fresh copy from your USB drive.\n» Channel: You are going in person using verbal, facial, and body language\ncommunication.\n» Source: Again, this is you as the social engineer, unless you have a good\nreason to have a stand in.\nHolding a coff ee-stained folder with some wet papers in it can help sell the story.\nLooking dejected and not alpha-male-ish can also help sell it. Politely speaking to\nher and not using foul language will help her feel a liking to you and maybe even\nsome pity. Th e USB key should contain a fi le called myresume.doc or myresume.pdf\nand be printable. PDFs are the most commonly used formats since most companies\nare running an older version of Adobe Reader that is vulnerable to many diff erent\nexploits. Make sure the resume is in a format that allows for the most people to be\nable to open it—not some odd format.\nMost of the time people want to help. They want to be able to\nassist a person in distress if the story is believable as well as heart\nwrenching. For a special twist if you really lack a heart as a social\nengineer, you can put a spin on the story: On my way over, it was\nmy turn today to drop my daughter off at school. When she climbed\nover the seat to give me a kiss goodbye she knocked over my coffee\ninto my bag. I was already running late and closer to here than\nhome; could you print me a fresh copy?\nEither way, this story usually works and will lead to the USB key being inserted\ninto the computer and most likely a complete compromise of the receptionist’s\ncomputer, which can lead to a total compromise of the company.\nINFORMATION GATHERING 53\nThe Power of Communication Models\nCommunication modeling is a powerful tool that is a must-have skill for every\nsocial engineer. Th e hardest part about communication modeling is to ensure your\ninformation-gathering sessions are solid.\nIn both of the earlier scenarios, not having a good plan and model will lead to\nfailure. A good way to practice communication modeling is to write out a model\nfor manipulating people you know well—a husband, wife, parent, child, boss, or\nfriend—to do something you want, to take some action you desire.\nSet a goal, nothing malicious, such as getting someone to agree to a diff erent\nvacation spot or a to go to a restaurant you love and your partner hates, or to allow\nyou to spend some money on something you normally wouldn’t ask for. Whatever\nit is you come up with, write out the fi ve communication components and then see\nhow well the communication goes when you have a written plan. You will fi nd that\nwith your goals clearly defi ned, you can better test your social engineering commu-\nnication methods, and be able to achieve your goals more easily. List the following\nfi ve points and fi ll them out one by one, connecting the dots as you go along.\n» Source\n» Message\n» Channel\n» Receivers\n» Feedback\nCommunication modeling yields very valuable information and without it, most\ncommunication will not be successful for a social engineer. As previously men-\ntioned, information gathering is the crux of every social engineering gig, but if you\nbecome profi cient at information gathering and you are able to gather amazing\namounts of data but don’t know how to use it, it is a waste.\nLearn to become a master at information gathering and then practice putting\nthat into action with communication modeling. Th is is just the start, but it can\nliterally change the way you deal with people both as a social engineer and in\neveryday contexts. Yet so much more goes into developing a solid message in the\ncommunication model.\nOne key aspect of learning how to communicate, how to manipulate, and how to\nbe a social engineer is learning how to use questions, as discussed in the next chapter.",

    "text": "3\nElicitation\nTh e supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fi ghting.\n—Sun Tzu\nB\neing able to effectively draw people out is a skill that can make or break a social\nengineer. When people see you and talk to you they should feel at ease and\nwant to open up.\nHave you ever met someone and instantly felt, “Wow I like that person”? Why?\nWhat was it about him that made you feel that way? Was it his smile? Th e way he\nlooked? Th e way he treated you? His body language?\nMaybe he even seemed to be “in tune” with your thoughts and desires. Th e way\nhe looked at you was non-judgmental and right away you felt at ease with him.\nNow imagine you can tap into that and master that ability. Don’t shrug off this\nchapter as a simple “how to build rapport” lesson. Th is chapter is about elicitation, a\npowerful technique used by spies, con men, and social engineers, as well as doctors,\ntherapists, and law enforcement, and if you want to be protected or be a great social\nengineer auditor then you need to master this skill. Used eff ectively, elicitation can\nproduce astounding results.\nWhat is elicitation? Very few aspects of social engineering are as powerful as\nelicitation. Th is is one of the reasons it is near the top of the framework. Th is skill\nalone can change the way people view you. From a social engineering standpoint, it\ncan change the way you practice security. Th is chapter dissects examples of expert\nelicitation and delves deep into how to utilize this powerful skill in a social engi-\nneering context.\nBefore getting in too deep, you must begin with the basics.\n56 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nWhat Is Elicitation?\nElicitation means to bring or draw out, or to arrive at a conclusion (truth, for instance)\nby logic. Alternatively, it is defi ned as a stimulation that calls up (or draws forth) a\nparticular class of behaviors, as in “the elicitation of his testimony was not easy.”\nRead that defi nition again and if it doesn’t give you goose bumps you may have\na problem. Th ink about what this means. Being able to eff ectively use elicitation\nmeans you can fashion questions that draw people out and stimulate them to take\na path of a behavior you want. As a social engineer, what does this mean? Being\neff ective at elicitation means you can fashion your words and your questions in\nsuch a way that it will enhance your skill level to a whole new level. In terms of\ninformation gathering, expert elicitation can translate into you target wanting to\nanswer your every request.\nI want to take this discussion one step further because many governments edu-\ncate and warn their employees against elicitation because it is used by spies all over\nthe earth.\nIn training materials, the National Security Agency of the United States govern-\nment defi nes elicitation as “the subtle extraction of information during an apparently\nnormal and innocent conversation.”\nTh ese conversations can occur anywhere that the target is—a restaurant, the\ngym, a daycare—anywhere. Elicitation works well because it is low risk and often\nvery hard to detect. Most of the time, the targets don’t ever know where the infor-\nmation leak came from. Even if a suspicion exists that there is some wrong intent,\none can easily pass it off as an angry stranger being accused of wrong doing for just\nasking a question.\nElicitation works so well for several reasons:\n» Most people have the desire to be polite, especially to strangers.\n» Professionals want to appear well informed and intelligent.\n» If you are praised, you will often talk more and divulge more.\n» Most people would not lie for the sake of lying.\n» Most people respond kindly to people who appear concerned about them.\nTh ese key factors about most humans are why elicitation works so well. Getting\npeople to talk about their accomplishments is too easy.\nIn one scenario in which I was tasked to gather intel on a company, I met my\ntarget at a local chamber of commerce function. Because it was a mixer I hung\nELICITATION 57\nback until I saw the target approaching the bar. We got there at the same time and\nbecause the purpose of these functions is to meet and greet people and exchange\nbusiness cards, my fi rst move wasn’t extreme.\nI said, “Escaping from the vultures?”\nHe replied with a chuckle, “Yeah, this is what makes these things worth the\ntime—open bar.”\nI listened to him order, and I ordered a similar drink. I lean over with my hand\nout, and said, “Paul Williams.”\n“Larry Smith.”\nI pulled out a business card I had ordered online. “I work with a little import\ncompany as the head of purchasing.”\nHe said as he handed me his card, “I am the CFO for XYZ.”\nWith a chuckle I responded, “You’re the guy with the bucks—that’s why everyone\nis after you out there. What exactly do you guys do?”\nHe bagan to relate a few details of his company’s products, and when he listed\none that is well known, I said, “Oh right, you guys make that widget; I love that thing.\nI read in XYZ Magazine it hit a new sales record for you guys.” From my previous\ninformation gathering I knew he had personal interest in that device so my praise\nwas well received.\nHe began to puff his chest out a bit. “Did you know that device sold more in the\nfi rst month that our previous and next fi ve products combined?”\n“Yikes, well I can see why, because I bought fi ve myself.” I chuckled through the\nmild praise.\nAfter another drink and some more time I was able to discover that they recently\npurchased accounting software, the name of the CSO (and the fact he was on vaca-\ntion for a few days), and that my friend here was also going on vacation soon to the\nBahamas with his wife.\nTh is seemingly useless info is not useless at all. I have a list of details about\nsoftware, people, and vacations that can help me plan an attack. But I didn’t want\nto stop there; I went in for the kill with a question like this:\n“I know this is a weird question, but we are a small company and my boss told me\nI am to research and buy a security system for the doors. We just use keys now, but\nhe was thinking RFID or something like that. Do you know what you guys use?”\nTh is question I thought would send up red fl ares and smoke signals. Instead, he\nsaid “I have no clue; I just signed the checks for it. What I do know is I have this fancy\nlittle card…” as he pulls out his wallet to show me his card. “I think it is RFID, but\nall I know is that I wave my wallet in front of the little box and the door opens.”\n58 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nWe exchanged laughs and I walked away with knowledge that led to some very\nsuccessful attack vectors. As you may have noticed, elicitation is similar to and\nlinked to information gathering. Th is particular information-gathering session was\nmade so much easier by a solid pretext (discussed in Chapter 4) as well good elicita-\ntion skills. Elicitation skills are what made the questions fl ow smoothly and what\nmade the target feel comfortable answering my questions.\nKnowing that he was on vacation and what kinds of accounting software they\nused as well as the door locking security I was able to plan an onsite visit to repair a\n“faulty” RFID box and time clock. Simply telling the front desk receptionist, “Larry\ncalled me before he left for the Bahamas and said there was a time clock by the\nmanufacturing department that is not registering properly. It will take me a few\nminutes to test and analyze it.” I was given access in a matter of seconds without\never being questioned.\nElicitation led me to that success because with the knowledge I was given there\nwas no reason for the receptionist to doubt my pretext.\nSimple, light, airy conversation is all it takes to get some of the best informa-\ntion out of many people. As discussed so far, clearly defi ning your goals to achieve\nmaximum results is vital. Elicitation is not used merely for information gathering,\nbut it can also be used to solidify your pretext and gain access to information. All\nof this depends on a clearly defi ned and thought-out elicitation model.\nThe Goals of Elicitation\nReviewing the defi nition for elicitation can give you a clear path of what your goals\nare. Really, though, you can boil it down to one thing. A social engineer wants the\ntarget to take an action, whether that action be as simple as answering a question\nor as big as allowing access to a certain restricted area. To get the target to comply,\nthe social engineer will ask a series of questions or hold a conversation that will\nmotivate the target to that path.\nInformation is the key. Th e more information that you gather, the more success-\nful the attack will be. Because elicitation is non-threatening it is very successful.\nCount how many times in a week you have meaningless little conversations with\nsomeone at a store, coff ee shop, or elsewhere. Th e whole methodology of holding\nconversations is steeped in elicitation and it is used in a non-malicious way daily.\nTh at is why it is so eff ective.\nIn one episode of the popular British television show Th e Real Hustle, the hosts\ndemonstrated the ease of many social engineering attacks. In this episode the goal\nELICITATION 59\nwas to draw a target into a game of luck that was rigged. To do so someone had a\npartner who acted as a complete stranger play a role in being interested and con-\nversational with the attacker. Th is conversation draws in the surrounding people,\nwhich made eliciting proper responses from the target very easy. Th is is one method\nthat works well.\nWhichever method is used, the goal is to obtain information then utilize that\ninformation to motivate a target to the path the social engineer wants him to take.\nUnderstanding this fact is important. Later chapters cover pretexting and other\nmanipulation tactics, but you don’t want to confuse elicitation with those. Realizing\nthat elicitation is conversation is important. Sure, it may be closely linked to your\npretext, body language, and eye cues, but all of those pale in comparison to your\nability to engage people in conversation.\nSome experts agree that mastering the art of conversation has three main\nsteps:\n1. Be natural. Nothing can kill a conversation quicker than seeming to be\nuncomfortable or unnatural in the conversation. To see this for yourself\ntry this exercise. Have a conversation with someone about something\nyou know a lot about. If you can record it somehow or have someone\nelse take notice, see how you stand, your posture, and the way you assert\nyour knowledge. All of these things will scream confi dence and natural-\nness. Th en inject yourself in a conversation you know nothing about and\nhave the same recording or friend observing. See how all those nonverbal\naspects change for you when you try to inject an intelligent thought into\na conversation you know nothing about.\nThis exercise shows you the difference in being natural and not\nbeing natural. The person(s) you are conversing with will be able to see\nit easily, which will kill all chances of successful elicitation. How do you\nseem natural in conversations? Thus we arrive at step 2.\n2. Educate yourself. You must have knowledge of what it is you will be\ntalking to your targets about. Th is section should come with a big fat\nred neon light warning, but because every book can’t include one let me\nemphasize this part:\nIt is imperative that you not pretend you are more than you can rea-\nsonably be believed you are.\nConfused? Here’s an example to break it down. If you wanted to\nobtain the chemical composition for a top-secret product and your\n60 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nelicitation target is one of the chemists involved in making the product,\nand you decide to start talking chemistry, do not play yourself off as a\nworld-class chemist (unless you are). He may throw something at you\nthat will show you know nothing and then your cover is blown and so is\nthe elicitation.\nA more realistic approach may be that you are a research student\nstudying XYZ, and was told he had amazing knowledge in this area.\nDue to his expertise, you just wanted to ask him a question on a\nchemical formula you are working on and why it doesn’t seem to be\nworking out.\nThe point is that whatever you chose to converse about and whom-\never with, do research, practice, and be prepared. Have enough knowl-\nedge to speak intelligently about a topic that will interest the target.\n3. Don’t be greedy. Of course, the goal is to get information, get answers,\nand be given the key to the kingdom. Yet, do not let that be the focus.\nTh at you are only there for yourself will quickly become evident and the\ntarget will lose interest. Often, giving someone something will elicit the\nfeeling of reciprocation (discussed in Chapter 6), where he or she now\nfeels obligated to give you something in return. Being this way in conver-\nsation is important. Make the conversation a give and take, unless you\nare conversing with a person who wants to dominate the conversation. If\nhe wants to dominate, let him. But if you get a few answers, feel the con-\nversation out and don’t get greedy trying to go deeper and deeper, which\ncan raise a red fl ag.\nSometimes the people who are labeled as the “best conversational-\nists” in the world are those who do more listening than talking.\nTh ese three steps to successful elicitation can literally change the way you con-\nverse with people daily, and not just as a social engineer or a security auditor, but as\nan everyday person. I personally like to add one or two steps to the “top three.”\nFor example, an important aspect to elicitation is facial expressions during a con-\nversation. Having your gaze be too intense or too relaxed can aff ect the way people\nreact to your questions. If your words are calm and you have engaged the target in\na conversation but your body language or facial expressions show disinterest, it can\naff ect the mood of the person, even if she doesn’t realize it.\nTh is may seem odd to bring up here, but I am a fan of Cesar Milan, aka, Th e\nDog Whisperer. I think that guy is a genius. He takes dogs that seem unruly and\nELICITATION 61\nin a matter of minutes has both the dogs and their owners produce high-quality\npersonality traits that will merit a very successful relationship for both. He basically\nteaches people how to communicate with a dog—how to ask and tell it to do things\nin a language it understands. One of the things he preaches that I fully believe in\nis that the “spirit” or energy of the person aff ects the “spirit” or energy of the dog.\nIn other words, if the person approaches the dog all tense and anxious, even if the\nwords are calm, the dog will act tense, bark more, and be more on edge.\nObviously, people are not the same as dogs but I truly believe that this philosophy\napplies. As a social engineer approaches a target her “spirit” or energy will aff ect the\nperson’s perception. Th e energy is portrayed through body language, facial expres-\nsions, dress, and grooming, and then the words spoken to back that up. Without even\nknowing it, people pick up on these things. Have you ever thought or heard someone\nsay, “Th at guy gave me the creeps” or “She looked like such a nice person”?\nHow does that work? Th e person’s spirit or energy is relayed to your “sensors,”\nthat data is correlated with past experiences, and then a judgment is formed. People\ndo it instantaneously, many times without even knowing it. So your energy when\nyou are going to elicit must match the role you are going to play. If your personality\nor mental makeup doesn’t enable you to easily play a manager then don’t try. Work\nwith what you have. Personally, I have always been a people person and my strong\nsuit is not topics like chemistry or advanced math. If I were in the situation men-\ntioned earlier I would not try to play the role of a person who knows about those\nthings. Instead my elicitation might be as simple as a stranger interested in starting\na conversation about the weather.\nWhatever methods you chose to use, you can take certain steps to have the upper\nedge. One of these steps is called preloading.\nPreloading\nYou stand in line to buy your $10 movie ticket and are barraged with sensory over-\nload of posters of upcoming movies. You stand in line to buy your $40 worth of\npopcorn and drinks, see more posters, and then you push your way through to get\na seat. Finally, when the movie starts you are presented with a series of clips about\nupcoming movies. Sometimes these movies aren’t even in production yet, but the\nannouncer comes on and says, “Th e funniest movie since…” or the music starts\nwith an ominous tone, a dense fog fi lls the screen, and the voiceover intones, “You\nthought it was over in Teenage Killer Part 45….”\n62 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nWhatever the movie is, the marketers are telling you how to feel—in other words,\npreloading what you should be thinking about this movie—before the preview starts.\nTh en the short 1–3 minutes they have to show you what the movie is about is spent\nshowing you clips to entice your desire to see the movie and to appeal to the crowd\nthat wants the comedy, horror, or love story.\nNot much has been written about preloading, but it is a very serious topic.\nPreloading denotes that you can do just what it says—preload targets with informa-\ntion or ideas on how you want them to react to certain information. Preloading is\noften used in marketing messages; for example, in the national restaurant chain ads\nthat show beautiful people laughing and enjoying the meal that looks so beautiful\nand perfect. As they say “yummm!” and “ohhh!” you can almost taste the food.\nOf course as a social engineer you can’t run a commercial for your targets so\nhow can you use preloading?\nAs with much in the social engineering world, you have to start from the end\nresults and work backward. What is your goal? You might have the standard goal\nof elicitation to gain information from a target on a project she is working on or\ndates she will be in the offi ce or on vacation. Whatever it is, you must set the goal\nfi rst. Next you decide the type of questions that you want to ask, and then decide\nwhat type of information can preload a person to want to answer those questions.\nFor example, if you know that later tonight you want to go to a steak place that\nyour coupon-loving wife doesn’t really enjoy, but you are in the mood for a rib eye,\nyou can preload to get a response that may be in your favor. Maybe earlier in the day\nyou can say something like, “Honey, you know what I am in the mood for? A big,\njuicy, grilled steak. Th e other day I was driving to the post offi ce and Fred down the\nroad had his grill out. He had just started cooking the steaks on charcoal and the\nsmell came in the car window and it has been haunting me ever since.” Whether\nthis elicits a response at this exact moment is not important; what you did is plant\na seed that touched every sense. You made her imagine the steaks sizzling on the\ngrill, talked about seeing them go on, talked about smelling the smoke, and about\nhow much you wanted one.\nSuppose then you bring home the paper and as you’re going through it you see\nan ad with a coupon for the restaurant you want to go to. You simply leave that page\nfolded on the table. Again, maybe your wife sees it or maybe she doesn’t, but chances\nare that because you left it with the mail, because you mentioned steak, and because\nshe loves coupons she will see the coupon left on the table.\nNow later on she comes to you and says, “What do you want for dinner tonight?”\nHere is where all your preloading comes in—you mentioned the smell, sight, and\nELICITATION 63\ndesire for steak. You left an easy-to-fi nd coupon on the table for the steak restaurant\nof choice and now it is dinner discussion time. You answer her with, “Instead of\nmaking you cook and having a mess to clean up tonight, we haven’t been to XYZ\nSteaks in a while. What if we just hit that place tonight?”\nKnowing she doesn’t like that place all you can hope is the preloading is working.\nShe responds, “I saw a coupon for that place in the newspaper. It had a buy one meal\nget a second half off . But you know I don’t like….”\nAs she is speaking you can jump in and off er praise: “Ha! Coupon queen strikes\nagain. Heck, I know you don’t like steak too much but I hear from Sally that they\nhave awesome chicken meals there, too.”\nA few minutes later you are on the way to steak heaven. Whereas a frontal assault\nstating your desire to go to XYZ would have most likely met with a resounding “No!”\npreloading helped set her mind up to accept your input and it worked.\nOne other really simplistic example before moving on: A friend walks up and\nsays, “I have to tell you a really funny story.” What happens to you? You might even\nstart smiling before the story starts and your anticipation is to hear something\nfunny, so you look and wait for opportunities to laugh. He preloaded you and you\nanticipated the humor.\nHow do these principles work within the social engineering world?\nPreloading is a skill in itself. Being able to plant ideas or thoughts in a way that\nis not obvious or overbearing sometimes takes more skill than the elicitation itself.\nOther times, depending on the goal, preloading can be quite complex. Th e earlier\nsteak scenario is a complex problem. Th e preload took some time and energy, where\na simplistic preload might be something as simple as fi nding out what kind of car\nthey drive or some other innocuous piece of information. In a very casual conversa-\ntion where you “happen” to be in the same deli at the same time as your target you\nstart a casual conversation with something like, “Man, I love my Toyota. Th is guy in\na Chevy just backed into me in the parking lot, not even a scratch.” With any luck\nas you engage the target in conversation, your exclamation about your car might\nwarm him up to the questions that you can then place about types of cars or other\ntopics you want to gather intel on.\nTh e topic of preloading makes more sense as you start to analyze how you can\nutilize elicitation. Social engineers have been mastering this skill for as long as\nsocial engineering has been around. Many times the social engineer realizes he has\nthis skill way before he turns to a life of social engineering. As a youth or a young\nadult he fi nds interacting with people easy, and later fi nds that he gravitates toward\nemployment that uses these skills. Maybe he is the center of his group of friends\n64 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nand people seem to tell him all their problems and have no problem talking to him\nabout everything. He realizes later that these skills are what gets him through doors\nthat might be closed otherwise.\nWhen I was young I always had this talent. My parents would tell me stories of\nhow I at fi ve or six years old would strike up conversations with complete strangers,\nsometimes even walking into the kitchen of busy restaurants to ask questions about\nour order or inquire how things were being done. Somehow I got away with it—why?\nProbably because I didn’t know this behavior wasn’t acceptable and because I did it\nwith confi dence. As I got older, that skill (or a lack of fear) came into full eff ect.\nIt also seemed that people, sometimes even complete strangers, loved to tell me\ntheir problems and talk to me about things. One story that I think helps to see how\nI was able to utilize not only preloading but also good elicitation skills was when I\nwas around 17 or 18 years old.\nI was an avid surfer and would do odd jobs to support my hobby—basically any-\nthing from pizza delivery to fi berglass cutter to lifeguard. One time I ran errands\nfor my father who owned an accounting/fi nancial consulting company. I would\ndeliver papers to his clients, get signatures, and bring them back. Often, many of\nthe clients would open up and tell me all about their lives, their divorces, and their\nbusiness successes and failures. Usually this started with a small session with them\ntelling me how great my Dad was to them. At the time I never understood why\npeople, especially adults, would open up to a 17–18 year old with the reasons their\nuniverse is breaking apart.\nOne particular client I would visit often owned an apartment complex. It was\nnothing huge and fancy; he just had a few properties that he owned and managed.\nTh is poor guy had real problems—family problems, health problems, and personal\nproblems—all of which he routinely would tell me about for as long as I would sit\nand listen. Th is is when it began to hit me that I could get away with saying or doing\namazing things if I just spent time listening to people. It made them feel important\nand like I was a good person. It didn’t matter if I sat there thinking about my next\ngreat wave; what mattered was that I listened.\nNormally I would listen for as long as I could stand the amazing amount of\ntobacco smoke he put out (he smoked more than any person I ever have seen in my\nlife). But I would sit and listen and because I was young and had no experience I\nwould off er no advice, no solution, just an ear. Th e thing was that I was truly con-\ncerned; I didn’t fake it. I wished I had a solution. One day he told me about how he\nwanted to move back out West where his daughter was and be closer to family.\nELICITATION 65\nI wanted to move on in life and get a job I thought would be cool, fun, and give\nme some more cash for surfboards and other things I “needed.” During one of my\nlistening sessions, a crazy idea popped in my head, and he viewed me as a respon-\nsible, compassionate young man with a “good head” on my shoulders. Th e preloading\ntook place over the months I spent sitting with him and listening. Now it was time\nto cash in on that. I said, “Why don’t you go back and let me run your apartment\ncomplex for you?” Th e idea was so absurd, so ridiculous that looking back now I\nwould have laughed in my face. But for weeks, months even, I had listened to his\nproblems. I knew the man and his woes. On top of that, I never laughed at or rejected\nhim. Now he had shared a problem with me, and here was a perfect solution, one\nthat took care of all of his problems as well as mine. My income needs were low,\nand he wanted to be close to his family. We had built a relationship over the last\nfew months and thus he “knew” me and trusted me.\nAfter some discussion we came to an agreement and he up and moved back out\nWest and I was a 17-year-old running a 30-unit apartment complex as the vice-\nlandlord. I could go on and tell you much more on this story but the point is already\nmade. (I will tell you the job went great until he asked me to try to sell his complex\nfor him, which I did in record time, at the same time selling myself out of a job.)\nTh e point is that I developed a rapport, a trust, with someone and without trying\nand without malicious intent, I had a chance to preload him over months with the\nideas that I was kind and compassionate and intelligent. Th en when the time arose\nI was able to present an absurd idea, and because of the months of preloading, it\nwas accepted.\nIt wasn’t until later in life that it hit me what was going on here. Th ere were\nso many factors at play that I didn’t realize at the time. Preloading from a social\nengineering standpoint involves knowing your goal before you start. In this case,\nI didn’t know I was going to try and land a crazy job with this guy. But preloading\nstill worked.\nIn most social engineering cases it would much quicker, but I think the principles\napply. Being as genuine as you can is essential. Because preloading involves the\nperson’s emotions and senses, give them no reason to doubt. Th e question you ask\nshould match your pretext. For preloading to work you have to ask for something\nthat matches the belief you built into them. For example, if my off er was to have\nme go visit my client’s family and take pictures rather than manage his apartment\ncomplex, it wouldn’t have matched the belief system he had of me, namely that I\nwas a smart, business-minded, caring young man. Finally, the off er, when made,\nmust be of benefi t to the target, or at least perceived as benefi t. In my case, there",
    "question": "What is elicitation and why is it a crucial skill for social engineers to master?",
    "summary": "Elicitation is a key skill in social engineering that involves drawing out information through conversation, making people feel comfortable and willing to share. It is a powerful technique that can change how people view you and help you gain access to restricted areas. Preloading, a related concept, involves planting ideas or thoughts in a target's mind to influence their reactions and responses. Effective elicitation requires being natural, knowledgeable, and not overly greedy, while preloading can be used to set the stage for successful information gathering."

    "text": "66 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nwas lots of benefi t to my client. But in social engineering the benefi t can be as little\nas “bragging rights”: giving the person a platform to brag a bit. Or the benefi t can\nbe much more and involve physical, monetary, or psychological benefi ts.\nPracticing elicitation and becoming profi cient at it will make you a master social\nengineer. Logically, the next section is how to become a successful elicitor.\nBecoming a Successful Elicitor\nAnalyzing just my own experiences I can identify some key components that led to\nmy success from fi ve-years-old to now:\n» A lack of fear to talk to people and be in situations that are not consid-\nered “normal.”\n» I truly do care for people, even if I don’t know them. I want to and enjoy\nlistening to people.\n» I off er advice or help only when I have a real solution.\n» I off er a non-judgmental ear for people to talk about their problems.\nTh ese are key elements to successful elicitation. Th e United States Department\nof Homeland Security (DHS) has an internal pamphlet on elicitation it hands out\nto its agents that I was able to obtain and archive at www.social-engineer.org/\nwiki/archives/BlogPosts/ocso-elicitation-brochure.pdf.\nTh is brochure contains some excellent pointers. Basically, as stated in it and\nin this chapter, elicitation is used because it works, is very hard to detect, and is\nnon-threatening. Th e DHS pamphlet approaches elicitation from a “how to avoid”\npoint of view, but the following sections take some of the scenarios and show you\nwhat can be learned.\nAppealing to Someone’s Ego\nTh e scenario painted in the DHS brochure goes like this:\nAttacker: “You must have an important job; so and so seems to think very highly\nof you.”\nTarget: “Th ank you, that is nice of you to say, but my job isn’t that important.\nAll I do here is…”\nTh e method of appealing to someone’s ego is simplistic but eff ective. One caution,\nthough: Stroking someone’s ego is a powerful tool but if you overdo it or do it without\nsincerity it just turns people off . You don’t want to come off as a crazy stalker: “Wow,\nELICITATION 67\nyou are the most important person in the universe and you are so amazing-looking,\ntoo.” Saying something like that might get security called on you.\nUsing ego appeals needs to be done subtly, and if you are talking to a true narcis-\nsist avoid eye rolls, sighs, or argumentativeness when she brags of her accomplish-\nments. Subtle ego appeals are things like, “Th at research you did really changed a lot\nof people’s viewpoints on…” or “I overheard Mr. Smith telling that group over there\nthat you are one of the most keen data analysts he has.” Don’t make the approach\nso over the top that it is obvious.\nSubtle fl attery can coax a person into a conversation that might have never taken\nplace, as stated in the DHS brochure, and that is exactly what you want as a social\nengineer.\nExpressing a Mutual Interest\nConsider this mock scenario:\nAttacker: “Wow, you have a background in ISO 9001 compliance databases? You\nshould see the model we built for a reporting engine to assist with that certifi cation.\nI can get you a copy.”\nTarget: “I would love to see that. We have been toying with the idea of adding a\nreporting engine to our system.”\nExpressing mutual interest is an important aspect of elicitation. Th is particular\nscenario is even more powerful than appealing to someone’s ego because it extends\nthe relationship beyond the initial conversation. Th e target agreed to further contact,\nto accept software from the attacker, and expressed interest in discussing plans for\nthe company’s software in the future. All of this can lead to a massive breach in\nsecurity.\nTh e danger in this situation is that now the attacker has full control. He controls\nthe next steps, what information is sent, how much, and when it is released. Th is\nis a very powerful move for the social engineer. Of course, if the engagement were\nlong-term, then having a literal piece of software that can be shared would prove\neven more advantageous. Sharing usable and non-malicious software would build\ntrust, build rapport, and make the target have a sense of obligation.\nMaking a Deliberate False Statement\nDelivering a false statement seems like it would backfi re off the top, but it can prove\nto be a powerful force to be reckoned with.\nAttacker: “Everybody knows that XYZ Company produced the highest-selling\nsoftware for this widget on earth.”\n68 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTarget: “Actually, that isn’t true. Our company started selling a similar product\nin 1998 and our sales records have beaten them routinely by more than 23%.”\nTh ese statements, if used eff ectively, can elicit a response from the target with\nreal facts. Most people must correct wrong statements when they hear them. It’s\nalmost as if they are challenged to prove they are correct. Th e desire to inform oth-\ners, appear knowledgeable, and be intolerant of misstatements seems to be built into\nhuman nature. Understanding this trait can make this scenario a powerful one. You\ncan use this method to pull out full details from the target about real facts and also\nto discern who in a group might have the most knowledge about a topic.\nVolunteering Information\nTh e DHS brochure makes a good point about a personality trait many of us have.\nA few mentions of it have appeared in the book already and it’s covered in much\nmore detail later on, but obligation is a strong force. As a social engineer, off ering\nup information in a conversation almost compels the target to reply with equally\nuseful information.\nWant to try this one out? Next time you are with your friends say something\nlike, “Did you hear about Ruth? I heard she just got laid off from work and is having\nserious problems fi nding more work.”\nMost of the time you will get, “Wow, I didn’t hear that. Th at is terrible news. I\nheard that Joe is getting divorced and they are going to lose the house, too.”\nA sad aspect of humanity is that we tend to live the saying “misery loves\ncompany”—how true it is in this case. People tend to want to share similar news.\nSocial engineers can utilize this proclivity to set the tone or mood of a conversation\nand build a sense of obligation.\nAssuming Knowledge\nAnother powerful manipulation tool is that of assumed knowledge. It is com-\nmonplace to assume that if someone has knowledge of a particular situation, it’s\nacceptable to discuss it with them. An attacker can deliberately exploit this trait by\npresenting information as if he is in the know and then using elicitation to build\na conversation around it. He then can regurgitate the information as if it were his\nown and continue to build the illusion that he has intimate knowledge of this topic.\nTh is scenario might be better illustrated with an example.\nOne time I was going to China to negotiate a large deal on some materials. I\nneeded to have some intimate knowledge about my target company in the nego-\ntiations and had to fi nd a way to get it before I met with them. We had never met\nELICITATION 69\nface to face but I was heading to a conference in China before my negotiations\nstarted. While at the conference I happened to overhear a conversation starting\nabout how to place yourself in a higher position when dealing with the Chinese on\nnegotiations.\nI knew this was my opportunity, and to make the situation even sweeter one of the\npeople in the small group was from the company I was going to be meeting with. I\nquickly injected myself into the conversation and knew that if I didn’t say something\nquick I would lose face. My knowledge was limited but they didn’t need to know that.\nWhen a small pause arose I began to talk about the Guanxi theory. Guanxi is basically\nhow two people who may not have the same social status can become connected,\nand then one is pressed upon to perform a favor for the other. I talked about how\nthis connection can be used, and then concluded by tying it in with how important\nit is as an American to not simply take a business card and stick it in my back pocket\nbut to review it, comment on it, then place it somewhere respectful.\nTh is conversation was enough to set me up as someone who had some knowl-\nedge and deserved to stay in the circle of trust there. Now that I had established my\nknowledge base I sat back and listened to each person express his or her experience\nand personal knowledge on how to negotiate properly with large Chinese companies.\nI paid very close and particular attention when the gentlemen who worked for my\ntarget company spoke. As he talked I could tell the “tips” he was giving were closely\nlinked to the business philosophies of his company. Th is knowledge was more valu-\nable than anything I could have paid for and it led to a very successful trip.\nTh ere are a couple more scenarios I feel are often used in elicitations.\nUsing the Effects of Alcohol\nNothing loosens lips more than the juice. Th is is an unfortunate but true fact.\nMix any one of the preceding fi ve scenarios with alcohol and you can magnify its\neff ects by 10.\nProbably the best way to describe this scenario is with a true story.\nIn 1980 a senior scientist from Los Alamos National Laboratory traveled to a\nresearch institute in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to talk about his specialty,\nnuclear fusion. He had extensive knowledge of U.S. nuclear weapons information\nbut knew the situation he was entering was dangerous and he needed to be deter-\nmined to stick to his topic.\nYet he was constantly barraged with increasingly detailed inquiries directly\nrelated to nuclear weapons. Th e attackers’ tactics would change and they would\nask many benign questions about fusion and astrophysics, his specialty.\n70 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nOnce they even threw a cocktail party in his honor. Th ey gathered around and\napplauded his knowledge and research—each time with a toast and a drink. Th ey\nbegan to inquire about classifi ed matters such as the ignition conditions of deute-\nrium and tritium, the two components in the then-new neutron bomb. He did well\nat fending off the constant questions, but after many toasts and a party in his honor,\nhe decided to give an analogy. He mused to the group that if you rolled those two\ncomponents into a ball and then rolled them off the table they would most likely\nignite because they had such low temperature threshold levels.\nTh is seemingly useless story and information most likely caused the research-\ners in China to discern a clear path of research on nuclear weapons. Th ey would\ntake this information to yet another scientist and now armed with a little more\nknowledge, use that knowledge to get to the next stage with him or her. After many\nattempts, it is very likely the Chinese scientist would possess a clear picture of what\npath to take.\nTh is is a serious example of how using elicitation can lead to gaining a clear\npicture of the whole answer. In social engineering it may be the same for you. All\nthe answers might not come from one source. You may elicit some information\nfrom one person about their whereabouts on a particular date, and then use that\ninformation to elicit more information from the next stage, and so on and so forth.\nPutting those nuggets of information together is often the hard part of perfecting\nelicitation skills. Th at is discussed next.\nUsing Intelligent Questions\nAs a social engineer you must realize that the goal with elicitation is not to walk up\nand say, “What is the password to your servers?”\nTh e goal is getting small and seemingly useless bits of information that help build\na clear picture of the answers you are seeking or the path to gaining those answers.\nEither way, this type of information gathering can help give the social engineer a\nvery clear path to the target goal.\nHow do you know what type of questions to use?\nTh e following sections analyze the types of questions that exist and how a social\nengineer can use them.\nOpen-Ended Questions\nOpen-ended questions cannot be answered with yes or no. Asking, “Pretty cold out\ntoday, huh?” will lead to a “Yes,” “Uh-uh,” “Yep,” or some other similar affi rmative\nELICITATION 71\nguttural utterance, whereas asking, “What do you think of the weather today?” will\nelicit a real response: the person must answer with more than a yes or no.\nOne way a social engineer can learn about how to use open-ended questions is to\nanalyze and study good reporters. A good reporter must use open-ended questions\nto continue eliciting responses from his or her interviewee.\nSuppose I had plans to meet a friend and he canceled, and I wanted to know\nwhy. I can ask a question like, “I was curious about what happened to our plans the\nother night.”\n“I wasn’t feeling too well.”\n“Oh, I hope you are better now. What was wrong?”\nTh is line of questioning usually gets more results than doing an all-out assault\non the person and saying something like, “What the heck, man? You ditched me\nthe other night!”\nAnother aspect of open-ended questions that adds power is the use of why and\nhow. Following up a question with how or why can lead to a much more in-depth\nexplanation of what you were originally asking.\nTh is question again is not “yes” or “no” answerable, and the person will reveal\nother details you may fi nd interesting.\nSometimes open-ended questions can meet with some resistance, so using\nthe pyramid approach might be good. Th e pyramid approach is where you start\nwith narrow questions and then ask broader questions at the end of the line of\nquestioning. If you really want to get great at this technique learn to use it with\nteenagers.\nFor example, many times open-ended questions such as, “How was school today?”\nwill be met with an “OK” and nothing more, so asking a narrow question might\nopen up the fl ow of information better.\n“What are you doing in math this year?” Th is question is very narrow and can\nbe answered only with a very specifi c answer: “Algebra II.”\n“Ah, I always hated that. How do you like it?”\nFrom there you can always branch out into broader questions, and after you get\nthe target talking, getting more info generally becomes easier.\nClosed-Ended Questions\nObviously, closed-ended questions are the opposite of open-ended questions but\nare a very eff ective way to lead a target where you want. Closed-ended questions\noften cannot be answered with more than one or two possibilities.\n72 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nIn an open-ended question one might ask, “What is your relationship with your\nmanager?” but a closed-ended question might be worded, “Is your relationship with\nyour manager good?”\nDetailed information is usually not the goal with closed-ended questions; rather,\nleading the target is the goal.\nLaw enforcement and attorneys use this type of reasoning often. If they want to\nlead their target down a particular path they ask very closed questions that do not\nallow for freedom of answers. Something like this:\n“Do you know the defendant, Mr. Smith?”\n“Yes I do.”\n“On the night of June 14th, did you see Mr. Smith at the ABC Tavern?”\n“I did.”\n“And at what time was that?”\n“11:45pm.”\nAll of these questions are very closed ended and only allow for one or two types\nof responses.\nLeading Questions\nCombining aspects from both open- and closed-ended questions, leading ques-\ntions are open ended with a hint leading toward the answer. Something like, “You\nwere at the ABC Tavern with Mr. Smith on June 14th at around 11:45pm, weren’t\nyou?” Th is type of question leads the target where you want but also off ers him the\nopportunity to express his views, but very narrowly. It also preloads the target with\nthe idea that you have knowledge of the events being asked about.\nLeading questions often can be answered with a yes or no but are diff erent from\nclosed-ended questions because more information is planted in the question that\nwhen answered gives the social engineer more information to work with. Leading\nquestions state some facts and then ask the target to agree or disagree with them.\nIn 1932 the British psychologist Frederic C. Bartlett concluded a study on recon-\nstructive memory. He told subjects a story and then asked them to recall the facts\nimmediately, two weeks later, and then four weeks later. Bartlett found that subjects\nmodifi ed the story based on their culture and beliefs as well as personality. None\nwere able to recall the story accurately and in its entirety. It was determined that\nmemories are not accurate records of our past. It seems that humans try to make\nthe memory fi t into our existing representations of the world. When asked ques-\ntions, many times we respond from memory based on our perceptions and what\nis important to us.\nELICITATION 73\nBecause of this, asking people a leading question and manipulating their memory\nis possible. Elizabeth Loftus, a leading fi gure in the fi eld of eyewitness testimony\nresearch, has demonstrated through the use of leading questions how distorting a\nperson’s memory of an event is easily possible. For example, if you showed a per-\nson a picture of a child’s room that contained no teddy bear, and then asked her,\n“Did you see a teddy bear?” you are not implying that one was in the room, and\nthe person is free to answer yes or no as they wish. However, asking, “Did you see\nthe teddy bear?” implies that one was in the room and the person is more likely to\nanswer “yes,” because the presence of a teddy bear is consistent with that person’s\nschema of a child’s room.\nBecause of this research the use of leading questions can be a powerful tool in the\nhands of a skilled social engineer. Learning how to lead the target can also enhance\na social engineer’s ability to gather information.\nAssumptive Questions\nAssumptive questions are just what they sound like—where you assume that certain\nknowledge is already in the possession of the target. Th e way a social engineer can\ndetermine whether or not a target possesses the information he is after is by asking\nan assumptive question.\nFor example, one skill employed by law enforcement is to assume the target\nalready has knowledge—for example, of a person—and ask something like, “Where\ndoes Mr. Smith live?” Depending on the answer given, the offi cer can determine\nwhether the target knows the person and how much she knows about him.\nA good point to note is that when a social engineer uses assumptive ques-\ntions the whole picture should never be given to the target. Doing so gives all the\npower to the target and removes much of the social engineer’s ability to control\nthe environment. Th e social engineer never wants to use assumptive questions\nto accuse the target of a wrong. Doing so alienates the target and again costs the\nsocial engineer power.\nA social engineer should use assumptive questions when he has some idea of\nthe real facts he can use in the question. Using an assumptive question with bogus\ninformation may turn the target off and will only confi rm that the target doesn’t\nknow about something that didn’t happen. Back to an earlier example, if I wanted to\ngain information from a leading chemist and I did some research and knew enough\nto formulate one intelligent sentence I could make an assumptive question but it\nwould ruin future follow up if I was not able to back up the assumption the target\nwould make of my knowledge.\n74 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFor example, if I were to ask, “Because deuterium and tritium have such low\ntemperature thresholds, how does one handle these materials to avoid ignition?”\nTh e follow-up information might be hard to follow if I am not a nuclear physicist.\nTh is is counterproductive and not too useful. Plan your assumptive questions to\nhave the maximum eff ect.\nOne adjunct that is taught to law enforcement offi cials that comes in very handy\nwhen using assumptive questions is to say, “Now think carefully before you answer\nthe next question…” Th is kind of a statement preloads the target’s mind with the\nidea that he must be truthful with his next statement.\nIt can take months or years to master these skills. Don’t get disheartened if the\nfi rst few attempts are not successful, and keep trying. Don’t fear, though, there are\nsome tips to mastering this skill. I will review these in closing.\nMastering Elicitation\nTh is chapter has a lot of information for you to absorb, and if you are not a people\nperson, employing the techniques covered might seem like a daunting task. Like\nmost aspects of social engineering, elicitation has a set of principles that when\napplied will enhance your skill level. To help you master these principles, remember\nthese pointers:\n» Too many questions can shut down the target. Peppering the target with\na barrage of questions will do nothing but turn off the target. Remember,\nconversation is a give and take. You want to ask, but you have to give to\nmake the target feel at ease.\n» Too few questions will make the target feel uncomfortable. Have you\never been in a conversation that is fi lled with “awkward silences”? It isn’t\ngood is it? Don’t assume that your target is a skilled and willing con-\nversationalist. You must work at making a conversation an enjoyable\nexperience.\n» Ask only one question at a time. Chapter 5 covers buff er overfl ows on\nthe human mind, but at this time your goal is not to overfl ow the target.\nIt is to merely gather information and build a profi le. To do this you can’t\nseem too eager or non-interested.\nELICITATION 75\nAs you have probably gathered, making elicitation work right is a delicate bal-\nance. Too much, too little, too much at once, not enough—any one of them will kill\nyour chances at success.\nHowever, these principles can help you master this amazing talent. Whether you\nuse this method for social engineering or just learning how to interact with people,\ntry this: Th ink of conversation as a funnel, where on the top is the largest, most\n“neutral” part and at the bottom is the very narrow, direct ending.\nStart by asking the target very neutral questions, and gather some intel using\nthese questions. Give and take in your conversation, and then move to a few open-\nended questions. If needed, use a few closed-ended questions to direct the target to\nwhere you want to go and then if the situation fi ts, move to highly directed questions\nas you reach the end of funnel. What will pour out of the “spout” of that funnel is\na river of information.\nTh ink about it in the situation discussed in this chapter of my target at the\nchamber of commerce gathering. My goal was to gather intel on anything that\nmight lead to a security breach.\nI started off the conversation with a very neutral question. “Escaping the vul-\ntures?” Th is question broke the ice on the conversation as well as used a little humor\nto create a bridge that allowed us to exist on the same plane of thought. I asked a\nfew more neutral questions and handed him my card while inquiring what he does.\nTh is segues smoothly into the open-ended questions.\nA brief information-gathering session that occurred earlier, using carefully placed\nclosed-ended or assumptive questions was key. After hearing about the company’s\nrecent purchase for new accounting software and network upgrades I wanted to go\nin for the kill. Having scoped out the building I knew it used RFID, but I wasn’t sure\nif the target would go so far as to describe the card and show it to me.\nTh is is where the use of direct questions played a role: coming right out and\nasking what security the company used. By the time I used that type of question\nour rapport and trust factor was so high he probably would have answered any\nquestions I asked.\nUnderstanding how to communicate with people is an essential skill for an elici-\ntor. Th e social engineer must be adaptive and able to match the conversation to his\nor her environment and situation. Quickly building even the smallest amount of\ntrust with the target is crucial. Without that rapport, the conversation will most\nlikely fail.\n76 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nOther key factors include making sure that your communication style, the ques-\ntions used, and the manner in which you speak all match your pretext. Knowing\nhow to ask questions that force a response is a key to successful elicitation, but if\nall that skill and all those questions do not match your pretext then the elicitation\nattempt will most surely fail.\nSummary\nTh is chapter covered some of the most powerful points in this whole book—pow-\nerful in the sense that applying them can change not only your social engineering\nabilities but also your abilities as a communicator. Knowing how to ask the right\nquestions in the right tense and the right manner can open so many opportunities.\nAs a social engineer, this is what separates success from failure. First impressions are\nbased initially on sight, but what comes out of your mouth fi rst can make or break\nthe deal. Mastering elicitation can almost guarantee success as a social engineer\nand can add serious weight to any pretext you decide to use.\nTh roughout this chapter I mentioned the power of pretexting. Th is is another\ntopic that every social engineer, both malicious and professional, must master. But\nhow can you ensure you accomplish this goal? To answer this you must learn about\npretexting and understand exactly what it is, as discussed in Chapter 4.",
    "question": "What are some key strategies and techniques used in social engineering to effectively elicit information from a target?",
    "summary": "Social engineering involves using human psychology to gain information or access. Elicitation is a key technique where the goal is to get detailed, useful information through subtle methods. The DHS pamphlet highlights that elicitation is effective, non-threatening, and hard to detect, making it a valuable tool for social engineers. By understanding and applying techniques like appealing to ego, expressing mutual interest, and using intelligent questions, one can master elicitation and improve their ability to communicate and gather information effectively."

Heck, I would love\nto be a little skinnier and better looking. Even though medical science hasn’t\ncome up with a pill that can make that possible, a solution to this dilemma does\nexist—it’s called pretexting.\nWhat is pretexting? Some people say it is just a story or lie that you will act\nout during a social engineering engagement, but that defi nition is very limiting.\nPretexting is better defi ned as the background story, dress, grooming, personality,\nand attitude that make up the character you will be for the social engineering audit.\nPretexting encompasses everything you would imagine that person to be. Th e more\nsolid the pretext, the more believable you will be as a social engineer. Often, the\nsimpler your pretext, the better off you are.\nPretexting, especially since the advent of the Internet, has seen an increase in\nmalicious uses. I once saw a t-shirt that read, “Th e Internet: Where men are men,\nwomen are men, and children are FBI agents waiting to get you.” As slightly humor-\nous as that saying is, it has a lot of truth in it. On the Internet you can be anyone\nyou want to be. Malicious hackers have been using this ability to their advantage\nfor years and not just with the Internet.\nIn social engineering playing a role or being a diff erent person to successfully\naccomplish the goal is often imperative. Chris Hadnagy might not have as much\npull as the tech support guy or the CEO of a major importing organization. When a\nsocial engineering situation arises, having the skills needed to become the pretext is\nimportant. In a discussion I was having with world-renowned social engineer Chris\nNickerson, on this topic, he said something I think really hits home.\nNickerson stated that pretexting is not about acting out a role or playing a part.\nHe said it is not about living a lie, but actually becoming that person. You are, in\n78 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nevery fi ber of your being, the person you are portraying. Th e way he walks, the way\nhe talks, body language—you become that person. I agree with this philosophy on\npretexting. Often when people watch a movie the ones we feel are the “best we\nhave ever seen” are where the actors get us so enthralled with their parts we can’t\nseparate them from their portrayed characters.\nTh is was proven true to me when many years ago my wife and I watched a great\nmovie with Brad Pitt, Legends of the Fall. He was a selfi sh jerk in this movie, a tor-\nmented soul who made a lot of bad decisions. He was so good at playing this part\nmy wife literally hated him as an actor for a few years. Th at is a good pretexter.\nTh e problem with using pretexting for many social engineers is that they feel it\nis just dressing up as a part and that’s it. True, the dress can help, but pretexting is a\nscience. In a way, your whole persona is going to portray you in a light that is diff er-\nent than who you are. To do this, you, as a social engineer, must have a clear picture\nof what pretexting really is. Th en you can plan out and perform the pretext perfectly.\nFinally, you can apply the fi nishing touches. Th is chapter will cover those aspects of\npretexting. First is a discussion of what pretexting really is. Following that is discus-\nsion of how to use pretexting as a social engineer. Finally, to tie it all together, this\nchapter explores some stories that show how to use pretexting eff ectively.\nWhat Is Pretexting?\nPretexting is defi ned as the act of creating an invented scenario to persuade a tar-\ngeted victim to release information or perform some action. It is more than just\ncreating a lie; in some cases it can be creating a whole new identity and then using\nthat identity to manipulate the receipt of information. Social engineers can use\npretexting to impersonate people in certain jobs and roles that they never them-\nselves have done. Pretexting is not a one-size-fi ts-all solution. A social engineer\nmust develop many diff erent pretexts over his or her career. All of them will have\none thing in common: research. Good information gathering techniques can make\nor break a good pretext. For example, mimicking the perfect tech support rep is\nuseless if your target does not use outside support.\nPretexting is also used in areas of life other than social engineering. Sales; public\nspeaking; so-called fortune tellers; neurolinguistic programming (NLP) experts;\nand even doctors, lawyers, therapists, and the like all have to use a form of pretex-\nting. Th ey all have to create a scenario where people are comfortable with releas-\ning information they normally would not. Th e diff erence in social engineers using\npretexting and others is the goals involved. A social engineer, again, must live that\npersona for a time, not just act a part.\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 79\nAs long as the audit or social engineering gig lasts, you need to be in the persona.\nI “get in character” myself, as do many of my colleagues, some of whom even stay\nin character “off the clock.” Anywhere you need to, you should be the pretext you\nset out to be. In addition, many professional social engineers have many diff erent\nonline, social media, email, and other accounts to back up a slew of pretexts.\nI once interviewed radio icon Tom Mischke on this topic for a social engineer-\ning podcast I am a part of (hosted at www.social-engineer.org/episode-002-\npretexting-not-just-for-social-engineers/). Radio hosts must be profi cient\nat pretexting because they constantly have to release only the information they\nwant to the public. Tom was so profi cient at this that many listeners felt as if they\n“knew” him as a friend. He would get invitations to weddings, anniversaries, and\neven births. How was Tom able to accomplish this amazing kind of pretext?\nTh e answer is practice. Lots and lots of practice is what he prescribed. He told\nme that he would actually plan out his “acts” then practice them—use the voice\nthey would have, sit how they would sit, maybe even dress like they would dress.\nPractice is exactly what makes a good pretext.\nA very important aspect to remember is that the quality of the pretext is directly\nlinked to the quality of the information gathered. Th e more, the better, and the more\nrelevant the information the easier it will be for the pretext to be developed and be\nsuccessful. For example, the classic pretext of a tech support guy would utterly fail\nif you went to a company that either had internal support or outsourced to a very\nsmall company of one or two people. As natural as you are when you converse with\nsomeone about who you really are is how easy applying your pretext should be.\nSo that you can see how you can utilize this skill, the following section covers\nthe principles of pretexting then shows how you can apply them to actually plan-\nning a solid pretext.\nThe Principles and Planning Stages\nof Pretexting\nAs with every skill, certain principles dictate the steps to performing that task.\nPretexting is no diff erent. Th e following is a list of principles of pretexting that you\ncan use. By no means are these the only principles out there; maybe others can be\nadded, but these principles embody the essence of pretexting:\n» Th e more research you do the better the chance of success.\n» Involving your own personal interests will increase success.\n80 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Practice dialects or expressions.\n» Many times social engineering eff ort can be reduced if the phone is\nviewed as less important. But as a social engineer, using the phone should\nnot reduce the eff ort put into the social engineering gig.\n» Th e simpler the pretext the better the chance of success.\n» Th e pretext should appear spontaneous.\n» Provide a logical conclusion or follow through for the target.\nTh e following sections discuss each of these principles in detail.\nThe More Research You Do, the Better\nthe Chance of Success\nTh is principle is self-explanatory, but it can’t be said enough—the level of success is\ndirectly connected to the level and depth of research. As discussed in Chapter 2, it\nis the crux of successful social engineering. Th e more information a social engineer\nholds the more chances he or she has of developing a pretext that works. Remember\nthe story I told in Chapter 2 about my mentor Mati Aharoni and how he convinced\na high-level executive to visit his “stamp collection” site online? At fi rst glance, the\npath inside that company might have seemed to be something to do with fi nancial,\nbanking, fund raising, or something along those lines because it was a banking facil-\nity. Th e more research Mati did, the clearer it became that the pretext could be a\nperson who was selling a stamp collection. Finding out what the executive’s interests\nwere allowed Mati to fi nd an easy way into the company, and it worked.\nSometimes those little details that are what make the diff erence. Remember, no\ninformation is irrelevant. While gathering information, looking for stories, items,\nor aspects of a personal nature is also a good idea. Using a target’s personal or\nemotional attachments can enable you to get a foot in the door. If the social engi-\nneer fi nds out that every year the CFO donates a sizable sum to a children’s cancer\nresearch center, then a pretext that involves fund raising for this cause could very\nlikely work, as heartless as it sounds.\nTh e problem is that malicious social engineers use pretexts that feed on emo-\ntions without a second thought. After the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York\nCity on September 11, 2001, many malicious hackers and social engineers used the\nlosses of these people to raise funds for themselves via websites and emails that\ntargeted people’s computers and fake fund raisers that obtained funds from those\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 81\nwith a giving heart. After the earthquakes in Chile and Haiti in 2010, the same\nthings occurred where many malicious social engineers developed websites that\nwere positioned as giving out information on the seismic activity or the people\nwho were lost. Th ese sites were encoded with malicious code and hacked people’s\ncomputers.\nTh is is even more evident directly after the death of a movie or music star. Search\nengine optimization (SEO) and marketing geniuses will have the search engines\npulling up their stories in a matter of hours. Along with marketers, malicious social\nengineers will take advantage of the increased search engine attention by launching\nmalicious sites that feed off that SEO. Drawing people to these sites, they harvest\ninformation or infect them with viruses.\nTh at people will take advantage of others’ misfortune is a sad fact about this\nworld, and one of those dark corners I said you would visit in this book. As a social\nengineering auditor, I can use an employee’s emotions to show a company that even\npeople with seemingly good intentions can trick a company’s employees into giving\naccess to valuable and business-ruining data.\nAll these examples solidify the point that the better a social engineer’s informa-\ntion-gathering and research-gathering process, the better chance he has at fi nding\nsome detail that will increase the chances of a successful pretext.\nInvolve Personal Interests to Increase Success\nUsing your own personal interests to increase the chances of a successful social\nengineering move seems very simple but it can go a long way in convincing the target\nthat you are credible. Nothing can ruin rapport and trust faster than a person who\nclaims to be knowledgeable about a topic and then falls short. As a social engineer,\nif you have never seen a server room before and have never taken a computer apart,\ntrying to play the part of a technician can be a quick path to failure. Including topics\nand activities in your pretext that you are interested in gives you a lot to talk about\nand gives you the ability to portray intelligence as well as confi dence.\nConfi dence can go a long way toward convincing the target you are who you say\nyou are. Certain pretexts require more knowledge than others (for instance, stamp\ncollector versus nuclear researcher) to be convincing, so again research becomes\nthe recurring theme. Sometimes the pretext is simple enough that you can get the\nknowledge by reading a few websites or a book.\nHowever you gain the knowledge, researching topics that personally interest you,\nas the social engineer, is important. After you pick up on a story, aspect, service, or\n82 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ninterest that you have a lot of knowledge in or at least feel comfortable discussing,\nsee whether that angle can work.\nDr. Tom G. Stevens, PhD, says, “It is important to remember that self-confi dence\nis always relative to the task and situation. We have diff erent levels of confi dence in\ndiff erent situations.” Th is statement is very important, because confi dence directly\nlinks to how others view you as a social engineer. Confi dence (as long as it is not\noverconfi dence) builds trust and rapport and makes people feel at ease. Finding a\npath to your target that off ers you the chance to talk about topics you are comfort-\nable with, and that you can speak about with confi dence, is very important.\nIn 1957 psychologist Leon Festinger came up with the theory of cognitive dis-\nsonance. Th is theory states that people have a tendency to seek consistency among\ntheir beliefs, opinions, and basically all their cognitions. When an inconsistency\nexists between attitudes and behaviors, something must change to eliminate the\ndissonance. Dr. Festinger states two factors aff ect the strength of the dissonance:\n» Th e number of dissonant beliefs\n» Th e importance of each belief\nHe then stated that three ways exist to eliminate dissonance (which should cause\nevery social engineer’s ears to perk up):\n» Reduce the importance of the dissonant beliefs.\n» Add more consonant beliefs that outweigh the dissonant ones.\n» Change the dissonant beliefs so they are no longer inconsistent.\nHow does a social engineer use this information? Approaching a pretext with\nlack of confi dence when your pretext says that you should be confi dent automatically\ncreates dissonance. Th is dissonance raises all sorts of red fl ags and puts barriers up\nto rapport, trust, and forward motion. Th ese barriers aff ect the target’s behavior,\nwho is then expected to balance out her feelings of dissonance, and kills any likeli-\nhood of your pretext working.\nOne of the methods to counter that is to add more consonant beliefs so that\nthey outweigh the dissonant ones. What would the target expect of your pretext?\nKnowing that will allow you to feed their minds and emotions with actions, words,\nand attitudes that will build the belief system and outweigh any beliefs that might\nbring in doubt.\nOf course, a skilled social engineer can also change the dissonant beliefs so they\nare no longer inconsistent. Although this is trickier, it is a powerful skill to have. It\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 83\nis possible that your appearance does not fi t what the target might envision for your\npretext. You might think back to the show Doogie Howser, M.D. Doogie’s problem\nwas that his “pretext” of being a top doctor never fi t since he was so young. Th at\nwas a dissonant belief, but his knowledge and actions often brought that into the\nconsonant beliefs of his “targets.” Just like the previous example, a social engineer\ncan align his pretext with the target’s beliefs by their attitudes, actions, and espe-\ncially their knowledge of the pretext.\nOne example of this I recently saw in real life was at Defcon 18. I was part of the\nteam that brought the Social Engineering CTF to Defcon. We saw many contestants\nwho used the pretext of an internal employee. When presented with an objection like,\n“What is your employee badge number?” an unskilled social engineer would get nervous\nand either not have an answer or hang up, whereas a skilled social engineer would bring\nthose dissonant beliefs into alignment for the target. Simply stating a badge number\nthey found online or using another method they were able to convince the target that\ninformation was not needed, therefore aligning the target to their beliefs.\nTh ese points are very technical answers to a very simple problem, but you must\nunderstand that one can do only so much faking. Choose your path wisely.\nPractice Dialects or Expressions\nLearning to speak in a diff erent dialect cannot be glanced over quickly. Depending\non where you live, learning to speak a diff erent dialect or with an accent can take\nsome time. Putting on a southern drawl or an Asian accent can be very diffi cult, if\nnot impossible. Once I was in a training class with an international sales organiza-\ntion and it had some statistics that said 70% of Americans prefer to listen to people\nwith a British accent. I am not sure if that statistic is true or not, but I can say that I\nenjoy the accent myself. Now after that class, I heard quite a few people in the class\npractice their “cheerios” and “Alo Govenors,” which were horrible. I have a good\nfriend from the UK, Jon, who gets very angry when he hears Americans trying to\nuse lines from Mary Poppins in an imitation British accent. If he had heard this\ngroup, he might have blown a fuse.\nWhat that class taught me was that although the stats might say one accent is\nbetter than another for sales or just because you may be social engineering in the\nsouth or in Europe doesn’t mean you can easily put on the accent to make you appear\nlocal. When in doubt, throw it out. If you can’t make the dialect perfect, if you can’t be\nnatural, and if you can’t be smooth, then just don’t try. Actors use vocal coaches and\ntraining sessions to learn to speak clearly in the accent they have to portray. Actor\n84 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nChristian Bale is from Wales, but determining that fact from listening to him is very\ndiffi cult. He doesn’t sound British in most of his movies. Actress Gwyneth Paltrow\ntook on a very convincing British accent for the movie Shakespeare in Love.\nMost actors have dialect coaches who will work with them to perfect the target\naccent. Because most social engineers cannot aff ord a dialect coach, there are many\npublications that can help you learn at least the basics of putting on an accent, such\nas Dialects for the Stage by Evangeline Machlin. Although this is an older book, it\ncontains a lot of great tips:\n» Find native examples of the accent you want to learn, to listen to. Books\nlike Dialects for the Stage often come with audiotapes full of accents to\nlisten to.\n» Try speaking along with the recording you have, to practice sounding like\nthat person.\n» After you feel somewhat confi dent, record yourself speaking in that\naccent so you can listen to it later on and correct errors.\n» Create a scenario and practice your new accent with a partner.\n» Apply your accent in public to see if people fi nd it believable.\nTh ere are innumerable dialects and accents, and I personally fi nd it helpful to write\nout phonetically some of the sentences I will speak. Th is enables me to practice reading\nthem and get the ideas sunk into my brain to make my accent more natural.\nTh ese tips can help a social engineer master or at least become profi cient at using\nanother dialect.\nEven if you cannot master another dialect, learning expressions that are used\nin the area in which you are working can make a diff erence. One idea is to spend\nsome time listening to people in public talk to one another. A great place for this\nis a diner or a shopping mall, or any place you might fi nd groups of people sitting\nand chatting. Listen closely to phrases or key words. If you hear them used in a few\nconversations you might want to fi nd a way to incorporate these into your pretext\nto add believability. Again, this exercise takes research and practice.\nUsing the Phone Should Not Reduce the\nEffort for the Social Engineer\nIn recent years, the Internet has come to dominate certain more “impersonal”\naspects of social engineering, whereas in days past the phone was an integral part\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 85\nof social engineering. Because of this shift, many social engineers do not put the\nenergy or eff ort into phone usage that can make it truly successful.\nTh is topic is here to show that the phone is still one of the most powerful tools\nof the social engineer and the eff ort put into using it should not be diminished due\nto the impersonal nature of the Internet.\nSometimes when a social engineer plans a phone attack his thinking may diff er\nbecause using the Internet might appear easier. Note that you should plan to put the\nsame level of eff ort, the same level and depth of research and information gather-\ning, and most importantly the same level of practice into your phone-based social\nengineering attacks. I was once with a small group that was going to practice phone\npresentations. We outlined the proper methods, the tone, the speed, the pitches,\nand the words to use. We outlined a script (more on this in a minute) and then\nlaunched a session. Th e fi rst person made the call, got on the phone with someone,\nand messed up the fi rst few lines. Out of complete embarrassment and fear he just\nhung up on the person. Th ere is a very good lesson there—the person on the other\nend of the phone has no clue what you are going to say, so you can’t really “mess up.”\nPractice sessions can help you learn how to handle the “unknowns” caused by your\naccidentally altering something in your script that throws you off base.\nIf you are not as fortunate to have a group to practice or hone these skills with,\nyou will have to get creative. Try calling family or friends to see how far you can\nget manipulating them. Another way to practice is to record yourself as if you were\non the phone and then play it back later to hear how you sound.\nI personally feel that using an outlined script is very important. Here is an illus-\ntration: suppose you had to call your phone company or another utility. Maybe they\nmessed up a bill or you had another service problem and you are going to complain.\nAfter you explain yourself to the rep, telling her how upset and disappointed you are,\nand the rep does absolutely nothing for you, she says something like, “XY&Z is com-\nmitted to excellent service; have I answered all your questions today?” If the drone\nbehind the phone thought for one second about what she was asking she would realize\nhow silly it is, right? Th is is what happens when you use a written-out script instead\nof an outline. An outline allows you “creative artistic freedom” to move around in\nthe conversation and not be so worried about what must come next.\nUsing the phone to solidify your pretext is one of the quickest methods inside\nyour target’s door. Th e phone allows the social engineer to “spoof,” or fake, almost\nanything. Take into consideration this example: If I wanted to call you and pretend I\nwas in a bustling offi ce to add to the pretext I was trying to use, I could simply grab\nthe audio track from Th riving Offi ce (www.thrivingoffice.com/). Th is site off ers a\n86 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ntrack called “Busy” and another called “Very Busy.” From the creators: “Th is valu-\nable CD, which is fi lled with the sounds people expect to hear from an established\ncompany, provides instant credibility. It’s simple, eff ective, and guaranteed!”\nTh at sentence alone is fi lled with social engineering goodness—fi lled with what\npeople expect to hear from an established company. Already you can see that the CD\nis geared to fi ll expectations and provide credibility (at least, in the target’s mind,\nafter his expectations are met), thereby automatically building trust.\nIn addition, spoofi ng caller ID information is relatively simple. Services like\nSpoofCard (www.spoofcard.com) or using homegrown solutions, allows a social\nengineer to tell the target you are calling from a corporate headquarters, the White\nHouse, or the local bank. With these services you can spoof the number to be com-\ning from anywhere in the world.\nTh e phone is a deadly tool for social engineers; developing the habits to practice\nusing it and to treat it with utter respect will enhance any social engineer’s toolset for\npretexting. Because the phone is such a deadly tool and has not lost its eff ectiveness,\nyou should give it the time and eff ort it deserves in any social engineering gig.\nThe Simpler the Pretext, the Better\nthe Chance of Success\n“Th e simpler, the better” principle just can’t be overstated. If the pretext has so\nmany intricate details that forgetting one will cause a social engineering failure, it\nis probably going to fail. Keeping the story lines, facts, and details simple can help\nbuild credibility.\nDr. Paul Ekman, a renowned psychologist and researcher in the fi eld of human\ndeception, cowrote an article in 1993 entitled, “Lies Th at Fail.” In that article he says\n[t]here is not always time to prepare the line to be taken, to rehearse\nand memorize it. Even when there has been ample advance notice,\nand a false line has been carefully devised, the liar may not be\nclever enough to anticipate all the questions that may be asked,\nand to have thought through what his answers must be. Even clev-\nerness may not be enough, for unseen changes in circumstances\ncan betray an otherwise effective line. And, even when a liar is not\nforced by circumstances to change lines, some liars have trouble\nrecalling the line they have previously committed themselves to, so\nthat new questions cannot be consistently answered quickly.\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 87\nTh is very salient point explains clearly why simple is better. Trying to remember\na pretext can be almost impossible if it is so complex that your cover can be blown\nby a simple mistake. Th e pretext should be natural and smooth. It should be easy to\nremember, and if it feels natural to you, then recalling facts or lines used previously\nin the pretext will not be a task.\nTo illustrate how important it is to remember the small details I want to share a\nstory with you. Once upon a time I tried my hand at sales. I was placed with a sales\nmanager to learn the ropes. I can recall my fi rst call with him. We drove up to the\nhouse, and before we left the car he looked at the info card and told me, “Remember,\nBecky Smith sent in a request card for supplemental insurance. We will present the\nXYZ policy. Watch and learn.”\nIn the fi rst three minutes of the sales call he called her Beth and Betty. Each\ntime he used the wrong name I saw her demeanor change and then she would say\nquietly, “Becky.” I feel we could have been giving away gold bullion and she would\nhave said no. She was so turned off that he couldn’t get her name right that she was\nnot interested in listening to anything.\nTh is scenario really drives home the point of keeping the simple facts straight.\nIn addition to remembering the facts, it is equally important to keep the details\nsmall. A simple pretext allows for the story to grow and the target to use their\nimagination to fi ll the gaps. Do not try to make the pretext elaborate, and above\nall, remember the tiny details that will make the diff erence in how people view the\npretext.\nOn the other hand, here is an interesting tidbit: A popular tactic used by famous\ncriminals and con men is to purposely make a few mistakes. Th e thought is that “no\none is perfect,” and a few mistakes make people feel at home. Be cautious with what\ntypes of mistakes you decide to make if you employ this tactic because it does add\ncomplexity to your pretext, but it does make the conversation seem more natural.\nUse this tip sparingly, however you decide to proceed, keep it simple.\nLet me tie all this together with a few examples that I have used or seen used in\naudits. After some excellent elicitation on the phone, a nameless social engineer had\nbeen given the name of the waste removal company. A few simple Internet searches\nand he had a usable and printable logo. Th ere are dozens of local and online shops\nthat will print shirts or hats with a logo on it.\nA few minutes of aligning things on a template and he ordered a shirt and ball\ncap with the logo of the waste company on it. A couple days later, wearing the logo-\nladen clothing and carrying a clipboard, the social engineer approached the security\nbooth of the target company.\n88 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nHe said, “Hi, I’m Joe with ABC Waste. We got a call from your purchasing depart-\nment asking to send someone over to check out a damaged dumpster in the back.\nTh e pickup is tomorrow and if the dumpster isn’t repairable I will have them bring\nout a new one. But I need to run back there and inspect it.”\nWithout blinking, the security offi cer said, “OK, you will need this badge to\nget onsite. Just pull through here and drive around the back and you will see the\ndumpsters there.”\nTh e social engineer had a free pass to perform a very long and detailed dumpster\ndive but wanted to maximize his potential so went in for the kill with this line. While\nlooking at his clipboard he said, “Th e note says it is not the food dumpsters but one\nof the ones where paper or tech trash goes. Which block are those in?”\n“Oh, just drive the same way I told you and they are in the third bay,” replied\nthe security guard.\n“Th anks,” said Joe.\nA simple pretext, backed up by clothing and “tools” (like the clipboard), and the\nstorylines were simple to remember and not complex. Th e simplicity and lack of\ndetail actually made this pretext more believable, and it worked.\nAnother very widely used pretext is that of the tech support guy. Th is one only\nrequires a polo shirt, pair of khakis, and small computer tool bag. Many social engi-\nneers employ this tactic to get in the front door because the “tech guy” is usually\ngiven access to everything without supervision. Th e same rules apply: keeping the\nstoryline simple will help make this particular pretext very real and believable.\nThe Pretext Should Appear Spontaneous\nMaking the pretext appear spontaneous goes back to my point on using an outline\nversus using script. Outlines will always allow the social engineer more freedom\nand a script will make the social engineer sound too robotic. It also ties in to using\nitems or stories that interest the social engineer personally. If every time someone\nasks you a question or makes a statement that requires you to think, and you go,\n“Ummmm” and start to think deeply, and you cannot come back with an intelligent\nanswer, it will ruin your credibility. Of course many people think before they speak,\nso this is not about having the answer in one second, but about having an answer or\na reason for not having the answer. For example, in one phone call I was asked for\na piece of information I didn’t have. I simply said, “Let me get that.” I then leaned\nover and made it sound like I was yelling for a workmate: “Jill, can you please ask\nBill to give me the order form for the XYZ account? Th anks.”\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 89\nTh en as “Jill” was getting the paper for me I was able to obtain the data I needed\nand the paper was never brought up again.\nI have compiled a small list of ways that you can work on being more\nspontaneous:\n» Don’t think about how you feel. Th is point is a good one, because often\nin a pretext if you overthink you will start to add emotion into the mix,\nwhich can cause fear, nervousness, or anxiety, all of which lead to failure.\nOn the other hand, you might not experience nervousness or fear, but\nover-excitement, which can also cause you to make a lot of mistakes.\n» Don’t take yourself too seriously. Of course, this is great advice in life,\nbut it applies wonderfully to social engineering. As a security professional\nyou have a serious job; this is a serious matter. But if you’re not able to\nlaugh at your mistakes, you may clam up or get too nervous to handle a\nsmall bump in the road. I am not suggesting you take security as a joke.\nIn your mind, though, if you view a potential failure as the pinnacle of\nfailure in your life, the pressure you create can cause just what you fear\nthe most. Minor failures can often lead to greater success if you have the\nability to roll with it.\n» Learn to identify what is relevant. I like to phrase this concept as, “Get\nout of your head and into the world,” which is more great advice. A social\nengineer may be trying to plan three steps ahead and in the meantime\nmiss a vital detail that can cause the pretext to fall apart. Be quick to\nidentify the relevant material and information around you, whether it\nis the target’s body language, words spoken, or microexpressions (see\nChapter 5 for more on this topic), and assimilate the information into the\nattack vector.\nAlso keep in mind that people can tell when someone isn’t really lis-\ntening to what they are saying. Getting the feeling that even unimportant\nsentences are falling on deaf ears can be a massive turnoff for many peo-\nple. Everyone has experienced being with someone who just didn’t seem\nto care what he or she is saying. Maybe that person even had a legitimate\nreason to be thinking on a different path, but doing it is still a turnoff.\nBe sure to listen to what your target is saying. Pay close attention and\nyou will pick up the details that are very important to them and in the\nmeantime, you might hear something to help you in your success.\n90 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Seek to gain experience. Th is concept goes back to what you will prob-\nably see repeated four million times in this book—practice. Gaining\nexperience through practice can make or break the pretext. Practice\nspontaneity with family and friends and total strangers with absolutely no\ngoal in mind but to be spontaneous. Strike up conversations with people,\nbut not in a scary stalker kind of way—simple little conversations can go\na long way toward making you feel comfortable being spontaneous.\nTh ese points can defi nitely give a social engineer the upper hand when it comes\nto pretexting. Having the ability to appear spontaneous is a gift. Earlier in this\nchapter I mentioned my interview with Tom Mischke, who had an interesting take\non spontaneity. He said he wants to give the illusion of spontaneity wrapped in\npractice and preparation. He would practice so much that his pretext would come\nout as a spontaneous generation of humor and talent.\nProvide a Logical Conclusion or\nFollow-through for the Target\nBelieve it or not people want to be told what to do. Imagine if you went to a doc-\ntor and he walked in, checked you over, wrote some things on his chart, and said,\n“Okay; see you in a month.” Th at would be unacceptable. Even in the event of bad\nnews, people want to be told the next step and what to do.\nAs a social engineer, when you leave the target, you may need him to take or not\ntake an action, or you may have gotten what you came for and just need to leave.\nWhatever the circumstance, giving the target a conclusion or follow-through fi lls\nin the expected gaps for the target.\nJust as if a doctor checked you over and sent you home with no directions, if you\nengineer your way into a facility as a tech support guy and just walk out without\nsaying anything to anyone after cloning the database, you leave everyone wonder-\ning what happened. Someone may even call the “tech support company” and ask\nwhether he needed to do anything, or at worst you just leave the workers wonder-\ning. Either way, leaving everyone hanging is not the way to leave. Even a simple, “I\nchecked over the servers and repaired the fi le system; you should see a 22% increase\nin speed over the next couple days,” leaves the targets feeling as if they “got their\nmoney’s worth.”\nTh e tricky part for a social engineer is getting the target to take an action after\nhe or she is gone. If the action is vital for completion of the social engineer audit,",

Social engineers must practice and prepare to appear genuine, as even small mistakes can undermine their credibility."

For example, in the account in\nChapter 3 of my information-gathering session at the chamber of commerce event,\nif I wanted that target to follow-up with me through email I could have said, “Here\nis my card; will you email me some details on Monday about XYZ?” He very well\nmay have, or he could have gone to the offi ce, forgotten about me completely, and\nthe whole gig would have failed. What would be better is to say, “I would love to get\nsome more information from you. On Monday could I perhaps call you or shoot\nyou an email to get some more details?”\nTh e requests you make should match the pretext, too. If your pretext is being a\ntech support guy, you won’t “order” people around with what they must and must\nnot do; you work for them. If you are a UPS delivery person, you don’t demand\naccess to the server room.\nAs mentioned earlier, more steps may exist for perfecting a pretext, but the\nones listed in this chapter can give a social engineer a solid foundation to build a\nperfectly believable pretext.\nYou might be asking, “Okay, so you listed all these principles, but now what?” How\ncan a social engineer build a well-researched, believable, spontaneous-sounding,\nsimple pretext that can work either on the phone or in person and get the desired\nresults? Read on.\nSuccessful Pretexting\nTo learn how to build a successful pretext, take a look at a couple of stories of social\nengineers who used pretexts that worked and how they developed them. Eventually\nthey did get caught, which is why these stories are now available.\nExample 1: Stanley Mark Rifkin\nStanley Mark Rifkin is credited with one of the biggest bank heists in American his-\ntory (see a great article about him at www.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/\nHackers/hackers-Mark-Rifkin-Social-Engineer-furtherInfo.htm). Rifkin was\na computer geek who ran a computer consulting business out of his small apartment.\nOne of his clients was a company that serviced the computers at Security Pacifi c\nBank. Th e 55-fl oor Security Pacifi c National Bank headquarters in Los Angeles\nlooked like a granite-and-glass fortress. Dark-suited guards roamed the lobby and\nhidden cameras photographed customers as they made deposits and withdrawals.\n92 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh is building seemed impenetrable, so how is it that Rifkin walked away with\n$10.2 million and never held a gun, never touched a dollar, and never held up anyone?\nTh e bank’s wire transfer policies seemed secure. Th ey were authorized by a\nnumerical code that changed daily and was only given out to authorized person-\nnel. It was posted on a wall in a secure room that only “authorized personnel” had\naccess to.\nFrom the archived article mentioned previously:\nIn October 1978, he visited Security Pacific, where bank employees\neasily recognized him as a computer worker. He took an elevator\nto the D-level, where the bank’s wire transfer room was located.\nA pleasant and friendly young man, he managed to talk his way\ninto the room where the bank’s secret code-of-the-day was posted\non the wall. Rifkin memorized the code and left without arousing\nsuspicion.\nSoon, bank employees in the transfer room received a phone call\nfrom a man who identified himself as Mike Hansen, an employee\nof the bank’s international division. The man ordered a routine\ntransfer of funds into an account at the Irving Trust Company in\nNew York—and he provided the secret code numbers to authorize\nthe transaction. Nothing about the transfer appeared to be out of\nthe ordinary, and Security Pacific transferred the money to the New\nYork bank. What bank officials did not know was that the man who\ncalled himself Mike Hansen was in fact Stanley Rifkin, and he had\nused the bank’s security code to rob the bank of $10.2 million.\nTh is scenario off ers much to talk about, but for now, focus on the pretext. Th ink\nabout the details of what he had to do:\n» He had to be confi dent and comfortable in order to not raise suspicion\nfor being in that room.\n» He had to have a believable story when he called to do the transfer and\nhave the details to back up his story.\n» He had to be spontaneous enough to go with the fl ow with questions that\nmight have come up.\n» He had to also be smooth enough to not raise suspicion.\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 93\nTh is pretext had to be meticulously planned out with the utmost detail being\nthought through. It wasn’t until he visited a former associate that his pretext failed,\nand he was caught. When he was caught, people who knew him were amazed and\nsome even said things like, “Th ere is no way he is a thief; everyone loves Mark.”\nObviously his pretext was solid. He had a well-thought-out, and one would guess,\nwell-rehearsed plan. He knew what he was there to do and he played the part per-\nfectly. When he was in front of strangers he was able to play the part; his downfall\ncame when he was with a colleague who knew him, and that colleague saw a news\nstory then put two and two together and turned Mark in.\nAmazingly enough, while out on bail, Rifkin began to target another bank using\nthe same scheme, but a government mole had set him up; he got caught and spent\neight years in federal prison. Although Mark is a “bad guy” you can learn much\nabout pretexting from reading his story. He kept it very simple and used the things\nthat were familiar to him to build a good storyline.\nMark’s plan was to steal the money and turn it into an untraceable commodity:\ndiamonds. To do so he would fi rst need to be a bank employee to steal the money,\nthen a major diamond buyer to unload the cash, and fi nally sell the diamonds to\nhave usable, untraceable cash in his pocket.\nAlthough his pretext did not involve elaborate costumes or speech patterns he\nhad to play the part of a bank employee, then major diamond buyer, then play the\npart of a diamond seller. He changed roles maybe three, four, or fi ve times in this\ngig and was able to do it well enough to fool almost everyone.\nMark knew who his targets were and approached the scenario with all the prin-\nciples outlined earlier. Of course, one can’t condone what he did, but his pretexting\ntalents are admirable. If he put his talents to good use he would probably make a\ngreat public fi gure, salesperson, or actor.\nExample 2: Hewlett-Packard\nIn 2006 Newsweek published a very interesting article (www.social-engineer.org/\nresources/book/HP_pretext.htm). Basically, HP’s chairwoman, Patricia Dunn,\nhired a team of security specialists who hired a team of private investigators who\nused pretexting to obtain phone records. Th ese hired professionals actually got in\nand played the roles of HP board members and parts of the press. All of this was\ndone to uncover a supposed information leak within the ranks at HP.\nMs. Dunn wanted to obtain the phone records of board members and report-\ners (not the records from the HP facilities, but the personal home and cell phone\n94 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nrecords of these people) to verify where she supposed the leak was. Th e Newsweek\narticle states:\nOn May 18, at HP headquarters in Palo Alto, California, Dunn\nsprung her bombshell on the board: She had found the leaker.\nAccording to Tom Perkins, an HP director who was present, Dunn\nlaid out the surveillance scheme and pointed out the offending\ndirector, who acknowledged being the CNET leaker. That director,\nwhose identity has not yet been publicly disclosed, apologized. But\nthe director then said to fellow directors, “I would have told you all\nabout this. Why didn’t you just ask?” That director was then asked\nto leave the boardroom, and did so, according to Perkins.\nWhat is notable about this account is what is next mentioned about the topic\nof pretexting:\nThe HP case specifically also sheds another spotlight on the ques-\ntionable tactics used by security consultants to obtain personal\ninformation. HP acknowledged in an internal e-mail sent from its\noutside counsel to Perkins that it got the paper trail it needed to\nlink the director-leaker to CNET through a controversial practice\ncalled “pretexting”; Newsweek obtained a copy of that e-mail. That\npractice, according to the Federal Trade Commission, involves\nusing “false pretenses” to get another individual’s personal nonpub-\nlic information: telephone records, bank and credit-card account\nnumbers, Social Security numbers and the like.\nTypically—say in the case of a phone company—pretexters call up\nand falsely represent themselves as the customer; since companies\nrarely require passwords, a pretexter may need no more than a\nhome address, account number, and heartfelt plea to get the details\nof an account. According to the Federal Trade Commission’s Web\nsite, pretexters sell the information to individuals who can range\nfrom otherwise legitimate private investigators, financial lend-\ners, potential litigants, and suspicious spouses to those who might\nattempt to steal assets or fraudulently obtain credit. Pretexting,\nthe FTC site states, “is against the law.” The FTC and several\nstate attorneys general have brought enforcement actions against\npretexters for allegedly violating federal and state laws on fraud,\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 95\nmisrepresentation, and unfair competition. One of HP’s directors\nis Larry Babbio, the president of Verizon, which has filed various\nactions against pretexters.\n(If you’re interested in exploring it, the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection\nAct of 2006 can be found at http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc\n.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:h4709enr.txt.pdf.)\nTh e end result was that criminal charges were brought not only against Dunn,\nbut against the consultants she hired. You may wonder, “How is that possible con-\nsidering they were hired and contracted to perform these tests?”\nTake a look at what avenues they used and what information they obtained to\nhelp answer this question. Th e consultants obtained the names, addresses, Social\nSecurity numbers, telephone call logs, telephone billing records, and other informa-\ntion of the HP board members and reporters. Th ey actually used the Social Security\nnumber to establish an online account for one reporter and then obtain records of\nhis personal calls.\nPage 32 of a confi dential document from Hewlett-Packard to its lawyer and inter-\nnal legal staff (www.social-engineer.org/resources/book/20061004hewlett6\n.pdf) lists a communication from Tom Perkins to the HP board members that\noff ers a little more insight about what pretexts were used. A few tactics used were:\n» Th ey represented themselves as the carrier company to obtain the\nrecords of calls illegally.\n» Th e identities of the ones being investigated were used and spoofed to\nobtain their personal call records.\n» Online accounts with carriers were generated using illegally obtained\nnames, Social Security numbers, and other information to access their\ncall records.\nOn September 11, 2006, the United States House of Representatives Committee\non Energy and Commerce sent Ms. Dunn a letter (see a copy of this letter at\nwww.social-engineer.org/resources/book/20061004hewlett6.pdf) request-\ning the information she had obtained. Th ey listed in their requests the obtained\ninformation as the following:\n» All published and non-published telephone numbers\n» Credit card bills\n» Customer name and address info\n96 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Utility bills\n» Pager numbers\n» Cell numbers\n» Social Security numbers\n» Credit reports\n» Post offi ce box information\n» Bank account information\n» Asset information\n» Other consumer information\nAll of this information was obtained through a very gray area of professional\nsocial engineering: is what they did ethical and moral, even though they were hired to\ndo it? Many professional social engineers would not go to these lengths. Th e lesson\nto be learned from this very important case is that as a professional social engineer\nyou might mimic the methodologies and the thinking of malicious social engi-\nneers, but never should you stoop completely to their levels. Th e problem with\nthese consultants came in that they were authorized to pretext, social engineer,\nand audit Hewlett-Packard. Th ey were not authorized to social engineer AT&T,\nVerizon, utility companies, and so on. When employing pretexting you must have\nit outlined and planned so you know what legal lines you might get near and what\nlines you must not cross.\nHP’s story lends itself to a discussion about policy, contracts, and outlining what\nyou will be off ering if you are a social engineer auditor, but these topics are not\nwithin the context of this chapter. Using the principles outlined so far in this chapter\ncan help you make decisions that will keep you out of trouble.\nTh e danger with malicious pretexting is the threat of identity theft, which makes\nit a very valid part of a social engineer pentest. Testing, checking, and verifying\nthat your client’s employees will not fall for the methods used by malicious social\nengineers can go a long way in safeguarding you from a successful pretexter.\nStaying Legal\nIn 2005 Private Investigator Magazine was granted an interview with Joel Winston,\nAssociate Director of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Division of Financial\nPractices. His offi ce is in charge of regulating and monitoring the use of pretexting\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 97\n(see a copy of this valuable article at www.social-engineer.org/resources/book/\nftc_article.htm).\nHere are some of the key points from this interview:\n» Pretexting, according to the FTC, is the obtaining of any information\nfrom a bank or consumer, not just fi nancial information, using fraud,\ndeception, or misleading questions to obtain such information.\n» Using already-obtained information to verify that a target is a target,\neven while using false pretenses, is legal under the FTC’s defi nition of\npretexting, unless the social engineer is using this information to obtain\ninformation from a fi nancial institution.\n» Acquiring toll phone or cellular records through deceptive business prac-\ntices is considered illegal pretexting.\nThe FTC website provides some clarity and additional information to this\ninterview:\n» It is illegal for anyone to use false, fi ctitious, or fraudulent statements or\ndocuments to get customer information from a fi nancial institution or\ndirectly from a customer of a fi nancial institution.\n» It is illegal for anyone to use forged, counterfeit, lost, or stolen docu-\nments to get customer information from a fi nancial institution or directly\nfrom a customer of a fi nancial institution.\n» It is illegal for anyone to ask another person to get someone else’s cus-\ntomer information using false, fi ctitious, or fraudulent statements or\nusing false, fi ctitious, or fraudulent documents, or forged, counterfeit,\nlost, or stolen documents.\nAlthough the FTC’s focus is on fi nancial institutions, the guidelines outlined are\na reminder of what is considered illegal in the United States. Looking into their local\nlaws and making sure they are not breaking those laws is a good idea for profes-\nsional social engineers. In 2006, the Federal Trade Commission moved to expand\nSection 5 of the FTC Act to specifi cally include a law banning the use of pretexting\nto retrieve telephone records.\nHP’s pretexting situation ended in one of the private investigators being charged\nwith conspiracy and federal identity theft—very serious charges.",
    "question": "What are the key principles and ethical considerations involved in pretexting as a professional social engineering practice?",
    "summary": "Pretexting involves creating a believable scenario to gain access to information or services. It requires confidence, a well-researched and spontaneous story, and careful role-playing to avoid suspicion. A notable example is Stanley Rifkin, who used a pretext to steal money by impersonating a bank employee. Another example is Hewlett-Packard, where pretexting was used to gather personal information, raising legal and ethical concerns. Professionals must ensure their pretexting methods are legal and ethical to avoid similar issues."

    "text": "98 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nKeeping pretexting legal will entail some research on the part of the professional\nsocial engineer as well as a clearly defi ned and signed-off plan of what pretexts, if\nany, will be used.\nDespite the legal matters mentioned earlier, using a solid pretext is one of the\nquickest ways into a company. Pretexting is a talent all its own and, as you can see\nfrom this chapter, is not simply putting on a wig or a pair of fake glasses and pre-\ntending you are someone you are not.\nAdditional Pretexting Tools\nOther tools exist that can enhance a pretext.\nProps can go a long way in convincing a target of the reality of your pretext; for\nexample, magnetic signs for your vehicle, matching uniforms or outfi ts, tools or\nother carry-ons, and the most important—a business card.\nTh e power of the business card hit me when I was recently fl ying to Las Vegas\non business. My laptop bag usually gets scanned, rescanned, then swabbed for\nbomb dust or whatever. I am one of those guys who doesn’t really mind the extra\nsecurity precautions because they keep me from blowing up in the air, and I am\nhappy with that.\nYet I realize that 90 percent of the time I am going to get extra attention by\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA). On this particular trip I had for-\ngotten to take my lock picks, RFID scanner, four extra hard drives, bump keys (see\nChapter 7), and plethora of wireless hacking gear out of my carry-on laptop bag. As it\ngoes through the scanner I hear the lady working the x-ray say, “What the heck?”\nShe then calls over another gentlemen who stares at the screen and says, “I have\nno clue what the heck that stuff is.” He then looks around, sees my smiling face,\nand says, “Is this you?”\nI walk over to the table with him as he is emptying my RFID scanner and my\nlarge case of lock picks and he says, “Why do you have all of these items and what\nare they?”\nI had nothing planned but decided at the last second to try this move: I pulled\nout a business card and said, “I am security professional who specializes in testing\nnetworks, buildings, and people for security holes. Th ese are the tools of my busi-\nness.” I said this as I handed him a business card and he looked at it for about fi ve\nseconds and then said, “Oh, excellent. Th anks for the explanation.”\nHe neatly put all my items back in, zipped the bag up, and let me go. Usually I go\nthrough the bomb screening, the little dust machine, and then a patdown, but this\nPRETEXTING: HOW TO BECOME ANYONE 99\ntime all I got was a thank you and a quick release. I began to analyze what I did dif-\nferently than normal. Th e only diff erence was that I had given him a business card.\nGranted, my business card is not the $9.99 special from an online card printer, but\nI was amazed that what seemed to have happened was that a business card added\na sense of license to my claims.\nMy next four fl ights I purposely packed every “hacking” device into my bags\nI could fi nd and then kept a business card in my pocket. Each time my bag was\nexamined and I was asked about the contents, I fl ipped out the card. Each time I\nwas apologized to, had my items packed in neatly, and let go.\nImagine my experience was a pretext. Little details can add so much weight to\nwhat I am saying that I can appear valid, trustworthy, and solid with nothing more\nthan a card that tells people that everything I say is true. Don’t underestimate the\npower of a business card. One word of caution: getting a weak and pathetic-looking\nbusiness card can actually cause the opposite eff ect. A business card that was “free”\nwith an advertisement on the back will not add weight to a professional pretext. Yet\nthere is no reason to spend $300 on a business card to use once. Many online busi-\nness card printers can print a small amount of very nice cards for less than $100.\nAnother reason to take this chapter very seriously is that often times pretexting\nis the very fi rst step used by professional identity thieves. Because identity theft is\ntaking a front row seat in the crime industry of late, knowing what it is and how to\nidentify it is important for consumers, businesses, and security professionals. If you\nare a security auditor you must help your clients become aware of these threats and\ntest them for possible weaknesses.\nSummary\nIn addition to extensively covering pretexting and providing real-world examples of\npretexting in action, this chapter also continually brushed up against the psycho-\nlogical principles that aff ect diff erent aspects of pretexting. Th e logical next stop on\nthe framework covers just that—the mental skills that professional social engineers\nuse that make them seem like mind control masters and that give each social engi-\nneer a huge leg up in success.\nMind Tricks:\nPsychological\n5\nPrinciples Used in\nSocial Engineering\nIt all depends on how we look at things, and not on\nhow they are themselves.\n—Carl Gustav Jung\nI\nn Hollywood movies and television shows con men and law enforcement are por-\ntrayed with almost mystical talents. They have the ability to get away with anything;\nthey seem to be able to just look into the eyes of a person and tell if they are lying or\ntelling the truth. It is not uncommon to see situations like this: the cop looks into the\neyes of his suspect and can automatically tell whether he is lying or telling the truth,\nor with just the power of suggestion the con man’s targets are handing over their\nlife’s savings. Movies might have you believing that manipulation tactics and getting\npeople to do anything you want is plausible or even easy. Are these scenarios really\nfiction? Is it possible to gain such abilities that are saved for fantasy in the movies?\nTh is chapter could be a book unto itself, but I will condense this information\ndown to principles that will truly change the way you interact with people. Some\nof the topics in this chapter are based on research done by the brightest minds in\ntheir respective fi elds. Th e techniques discussed in these topics were tested and put\nthrough the paces in social engineering environments. For example, the topic of\nmicroexpressions is based on the research of the world-renowned psychologist and\nresearcher, Dr. Paul Ekman, who used his genius to develop techniques into reading\nfacial expressions that can literally change the way law enforcement, governments,\ndoctors, and everyday people interact with others.\nSome of the principles of Richard Brandler and John Grinder, the originators\nof neurolinguistic programming, changed people’s understanding about thought\npatterns and the power of words. Th ese topics are subjects for much debate, and\nthis chapter attempts to demystify this subject and explain how you can use them\nin social engineering.\n102 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nSome of the best interrogators on the planet developed training and frame-\nworks to help law enforcement learn how to eff ectively interrogate suspects. Th ese\nprinciples have such deep psychological roots that learning the methods used can\nliterally unlock the doors to the minds of your targets.\nUsing cues that people give in their speech, gestures, eyes, and faces can make\nyou appear to be a mind reader. Th is chapter examines these skills and explains\nthem in detail so they can be utilized by a professional social engineer.\nRapport is often a word used by sales trainers and salespeople, but it is a very\nimportant aspect of gaining trust and displaying confi dence. Knowing how to\ninstantly develop rapport with people is a skill that truly enhances the skill set of a\nsocial engineer, and this chapter shows you how.\nTh is chapter fi nishes with my own personal research on how you can use these\nskills to hack the human mind. A buff er overfl ow is a program usually written by a\nhacker to execute code, of malicious intent normally, through the normal use of a\nhost program. When executed the program does what the hacker wants. What if it\nwere possible to run “commands” on the human mind that would cause the target\nto do what you ask, give over information you seek, and, in essence, prove that the\nhuman mind is able to be manipulated?\nTh is powerful information, of course, can be used for very malicious intentions.\nMy goal in releasing this information to the public in this way is to pull back the\ncurtain from what the “bad guys” are doing by exposing their methods, thinking,\nand principles, then analyzing each one and showing what you can learn from it.\nExposing these techniques makes identifying, defending, and mitigating against\nthese attacks easier for everyone.\nTh is chapter is truly a mind-altering collection of data and principles. Following,\nstudying, and researching the methods will not just enhance any security endeav-\nors but these principles can also alter the way you communicate and interact with\nothers.\nBy no means, though, is this chapter a complete collection that covers all aspects\nof each of these skills. I provide links and tips to where you can fi nd more informa-\ntion and programs to help you enhance these skills. Th is chapter sets a foundation\nas well as acts like a guide, pointing you in a direction so you can learn to enhance\neach skill over time.\nLearning social engineering skills is not a quick process, so don’t be impatient.\nTh e methods of learning some of these skills can take years to perfect and a lot of\npractice to even become profi cient. Of course, you may possess a skill for a certain\naspect but if you do not, don’t become impatient with trying to learn it. Keep on\ntrying harder and practicing and you will get it.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 103\nBefore you get into the meat of this chapter, the following section sets the stage\nfor why and how these principles will work. You must understand the modes of\nthinking that exist. After you understand more clearly how people take in and\nprocess information you can begin to understand the emotional, psychological, and\nphysical representations of that process.\nModes of Thinking\nTo alter someone’s way of thinking you must understand the way people think and\nin what modes they think. Th is seems a logical fi rst step to even attempting this\naspect of social engineering.\nYou might think you need to be a psychologist or a neurologist to understand the\nmany aspects of how a person can think. Although that can help, it is not necessary.\nWith a little research and some practical application you can delve into the inner\nworkings of the human mind.\nIn August of 2001 the FBI put out a law enforcement bulletin (www.social-\nengineer.org/wiki/archives/ModesOfThinking/MOT_FBI_3of5.htm) that made\na few very profound statements on the modes in which people think:\nSimply confirming your nonverbal behavior to the client, using\nlanguage from the client’s preferred representational system and\nmatching speech volume, tone, and area of speech often overcomes\nclient reluctance to communicate.\nTh is simple statement has a lot of depth in it. Basically it is saying that if you can\nfi rst fi gure out the target’s dominant mode of thinking and then confi rm it in subtle\nways, you can unlock the doors of the target’s mind and help him actually feel at\nease when telling you even intimate details. Logically you may ask then, “How do I\nfi gure out a target’s dominant mode of thinking?”\nEven asking people what their mode of thinking is will not off er a clear answer,\nbecause many people do not know what mode of thinking they often reside in. Due\nto that, as a social engineer you must have some tools to help you determine this\nmode and then quickly switch gears to match that mode. A clear and easy path\nexists to this answer but you need to know the basics fi rst.\nThe Senses\nFor centuries philosophers have argued the value of perception. Some go so far as\nto say that reality is not “real” but just what our senses build into our perceptions.",
    "question": "What are the psychological principles used in social engineering and how can they be applied to gain trust and manipulate people's behavior?",
    "summary": "Social engineering involves using pretexts to gain access to a company, requiring legal research and a signed plan. A business card can significantly enhance the credibility of a pretext, as demonstrated by the example of a security professional passing through security checks.

    "text": "104 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nPersonally, I do not subscribe to that idea, but I believe that the world is brought\nto our brain by our senses. People interpret those senses for their perception of\nreality. In the traditional classifi cation we have fi ve senses: sight, hearing, touch,\nsmell, and taste.\nPeople tend to favor one of these senses and that is the one that is dominant. It\nis also the way people tend to remember things. As one exercise to determine your\ndominant sense, close your eyes and picture yourself waking up this morning—what\nis the very fi rst thing you remember?\nWas the feeling of the warm sun on your face? Or maybe you remember the sound\nof the voice of your spouse or children calling you? Do you remember clearly the\nsmell of coff ee downstairs? Or quite possibly the bad taste in your mouth, remind-\ning you that you need to brush your teeth?\nOf course, this science is not exact and realizing what your dominant sense is\nmay take a few tries to fi gure out. I once talked to a couple about this concept and\nit was interesting to watch their expressions. Th e wife fi rst remembered waking\nup and seeing the clock and then worrying that she was running late, whereas the\nhusband fi rst remembered rolling over and not feeling his wife next to him. After\nsome more questions it became evident that the husband was a kinesthetic, or his\ndominant sense was his feeling, whereas his wife was very visual.\nOf course, walking up to your target and saying, “Close your eyes and tell me\nthe fi rst thing you remember this morning,” doesn’t seem reasonable. Unless, of\ncourse, your pretext is the family shrink, you might meet with some opposition\non this route.\nHow can you determine without going through an embarrassing interrogation\nabout their morning rituals what a target’s dominant sense is?\nThe Three Main Modes of Thinking\nAlthough we have fi ve senses, the modes of thinking are associated with only three\nof them:\n» Sight, or a visual thinker\n» Hearing, or an auditory thinker\n» Feeling, or a kinesthetic thinker\nEach sense has a range within which it works, or a sub-modality. Is something too\nloud or too soft? Too bright or too dark? Too hot or too cold? Examples of these are\nas follows: staring at the sun is too bright, jet engines are too loud, and –30 degrees\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 105\nFahrenheit is too cold. Ivan Pavlov ran an experiment where he rang a bell every\ntime he fed a dog. In the end the dog would hear the sound of the bell, then salivate.\nWhat most people don’t know is that he was more interested in the physical and\nemotional aspects of sub-modalities. Th e interesting point is that the louder the bell\nrang the more the dog salivated. Th e range change of the sub-modality produced\na direct physical change. Pavlov’s research and all of his lectures are discussed in\nmuch detail at www.ivanpavlov.com.\nEven though people are very diff erent from dogs, Pavlov’s research is very impor-\ntant in understanding how a person thinks. Many of us can think in all three modes,\nbut we dominate in one—one “rings” the loudest. Even within our dominant mode,\nwe might have varying degrees of depth for that dominant sense.\nFollowing I will discuss some of the details of each of these modes in more\ndepth.\nVisual\nTh e majority of people are usually visual thinkers, in that they usually remember\nwhat something looked like. Th ey remember the scene clearly—the colors, the tex-\ntures, the brightness or darkness. Th ey can clearly picture a past event and even\nbuild a picture for a future event. When they are presented with material to decide\nupon they often need something to see because visual input is directly linked to\ndecision making. Many times a visual thinker will make a decision based on what\nis visually appealing to him regardless of what is really “better” for him.\nAlthough men tend to be visual, this does not mean that all men are always\nvisual. Th at visual marketing or visual aspects normally appeal to men is true, but\ndo not assume all men are visual.\nA visual person often uses certain words in his speech, such as:\n» “I see what you mean.”\n» “Th at looks good to me.”\n» “I get the picture now.”\nAnd the range that the dominant sense works in for a visual thinker can have certain\ncharacteristics, or sub-modalities, such as:\n» Light (bright or dim)\n» Size (large or small)\n» Color (black and white or color)\n106 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Movement (fast or slow)\n» Focus (clear or hazy)\nTrying to debate, sell, negotiate, manipulate, or infl uence a visual thinker with\nno visual input is very diffi cult if not impossible. Visual thinkers need visual input\nto make decisions.\nAuditory\nAuditory thinkers remember the sounds of an event. Th ey remember that the alarm\nwas too loud or the woman whispered too low. Th ey recall the sweetness of the child’s\nvoice or the scary bark of the dog. Auditory people learn better from what they hear\nand can retain far more from being told things than being shown things.\nBecause an auditory thinker remembers the way something sounded, or because\nthe sounds themselves help recall memories, he may use phrases such as:\n» “Loud and clear…”\n» “Something tells me…”\n» “Th at sounds okay to me.”\nAnd the range of this dominant sense can be within these sub-modalities:\n» Volume (loud or soft)\n» Tone (base or treble)\n» Pitch (high or low)\n» Tempo (fast or slow)\n» Distance (near or far)\nIt is imperative to choose your words carefully with auditory thinkers. Th e words\nthey hear will make or break the deal. I have seen whole encounters go from great\nto a disaster with one wrong word spoken to an auditory thinker.\nKinesthetic\nKinesthetic thinkers are concerned with feelings. Th ey remember how an event made\nthem feel—the warmth of the room, the beautiful breeze on their skin, how the\nmovie made them jump out of their seat with fear. Often kinesthetic thinkers feel\nthings with their hands to get the sense of the objects. Merely telling them some-\nthing is soft isn’t as real as letting them touch it. But helping recall a soft item they\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 107\ntouched before can recall emotions and feelings that are very real to a kinesthetic\nthinker.\nTh e term “kinesthetic” relates to tactile, visceral, and sense-of-self sensations of\nthe body—basically, where a person’s body is in space and the self-awareness of how\nsomething made him feel. A kinesthetic thinker uses phrases such as:\n» “I can grasp that idea.”\n» “How does that grab you?”\n» “I’ll get in touch with you.”\n» “I just wanted to touch base.”\n» “How does this feel?”\nAnd the range for this type can have the following sub-modalities:\n» Intensity (strong or weak)\n» Area (large or small)\n» Texture (rough or smooth)\n» Temperature (hot or cold)\n» Weight (heavy or light)\nHelping a kinesthetic thinker recall a feeling or emotion tied to something can\nmake those emotions reappear as real as the fi rst time they occurred. Kinesthetic\nthinkers are probably the most diffi cult for non-kinesthetic thinkers to deal with\nbecause they do not react to sights and sounds and social engineers have to get in\ntouch with their feelings to communicate with this type of thinker.\nUnderstanding these basic principles can go a long way toward being able to\nquickly discern the type of person you are talking to. Again, without asking the\ntarget to picture his morning rituals how can you discern the dominant sense? Even\nmore so, why is this so important?\nDiscerning the Dominant Sense\nTh e key to determining someone’s dominant sense is to try to introduce yourself,\nstart a small conversation, and pay close attention to what is being said. As you\nwalk up to the target and lean in to say good morning, maybe she barely looks at\nyou. She might be rude, or she just may not be a visual. Visuals need to look at the\nperson speaking to communicate properly, so this behavior would seem to lend\n108 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nto the fact she is not visual. Now ask a simple question such as, “Don’t you just love\nthe feel of a beautiful day like today?” and notice her response, particularly whether\nshe seems to light up or not.\nMaybe you wear a large, shiny silver ring. As you talk you gesture; maybe you\nsee that the ring catches her eye. Does she reach out, interested, and need to hold\nthe ring or get close to observe it? Kinesthetics are very touchy-feely when it comes\nto these things. I know a woman who is a strong kinesthetic and when she sees\nsomething she thinks is soft or high quality she must touch it. She will say, “Wow,\nthat sweater looks so soft!” From that statement one might assume she is a visual,\nbut what happens next is what solidifi es it. She then walks up to the person and\ntouches the sweater and feels it. Th is shows her dominant sense is kinesthetic. Th e\nsame woman must touch everything in the grocery store when she shops, whether\nshe needs it or not. By touching the objects, she makes a connection and that con-\nnection makes it real to her. Often she cannot remember things very well that she\ndid not come into physical contact with.\nAsking questions that contain some of the key dominant words, observing a\ntarget’s reactions, and listening can reveal what dominant sense he or she uses.\nListening for key words such as see, look, bright, dark can lead you to treat a target\nlike a visual. As mentioned earlier this is not an exact science. Th ere isn’t a general\nrule that states if a person says, “I can see what you are saying…” then he is always\na visual. Each clue should lead you down the path toward verifying your hunch\nwith more questions or statements. One word of caution: talking to someone in\na diff erent mode than they think in can be irritating to some. Using questions to\ndetermine a person’s mode of thinking can be off -putting. Use questions sparingly\nand rely more on observation.\nWhy Understanding the Mode Is Important\nI once worked with a guy, Tony, who could sell a cup of water to a drowning man.\nTony was a big believer in seeking out and then using a person’s dominant sense in\nsales. He had a few methods that he used that you may learn from. When he fi rst\nengaged the target he had a very shiny silver-and-gold pen he would hold in his\nhand. He would gesture a lot and notice whether the person followed the pen with\nher eyes; if she did slightly Tony would continually make the gestures bigger to see\nwhether her eyes followed. If that didn’t seem to work in the fi rst few seconds he\nwould click the pen open and closed. It wasn’t a loud noise, but loud enough to dis-\nrupt a thought and draw someone’s attention if she were an auditory. If he thought\nthat was working he would click it with every important thought, causing the target",
    "question": "How do different modes of thinking (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) influence a person's perception of reality and their response to communication?",
    "summary": "Social engineering involves understanding how people perceive the world through their dominant sense—visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. Each sense has specific sub-modalities that influence how individuals process information and make decisions. Recognizing a target's dominant sense helps in tailoring communication to be more effective, as people rely on their primary sense when making decisions. By observing reactions and using appropriate language, one can better connect with someone's dominant sense without direct questioning."

If that didn’t\nseem to work he would reach out over the table and tap her wrist or forearm, or if he\nwas close enough touch her shoulder. He didn’t touch excessively, but enough to see\nwhether she would shy away or seemed overly happy or disturbed by the touch.\nWith these subtle methods he could quickly discern what the person’s dominant\nsense most likely was. Th is whole act would take under 60 seconds. After he found\nthe information he was looking for, he would then start to move his conversation to\nthat dominant sense, even taking on the traits of that sense in the words he spoke\nand way he acted and reacted to the conversation. One thing about Tony is that he\noutsold any person I have ever met. People would often say about him, “It is like he\nknew exactly what I needed.”\nTony would talk to the person and treat the person the way they wanted to be\ntalked to. If the person was a visual thinker, Tony would use phrases like “Can you\nsee what I am saying?” or “How does this look to you?” He would use illustrations\nthat involved “seeing” things or visualizing scenarios. He would put people in their\ncomfort zone.\nPeople feel at ease when they are in their comfort zone. Th e more you can do as\na social engineer to put people in their comfort zone, the better chance you have\nat success. People gravitate towards those with whom they are comfortable; it is\nhuman nature. For example, if someone makes you feel “warm and fuzzy,” or seems\nto understand what you are saying, or seems to see where you are coming from, you\neasily open up to, trust, and let that person in your circle.\nI want to reiterate this point: fi nding and using someone’s dominant sense is\nnot an exact science. A social engineer should use it as a tool in the arsenal and\nnot rely on it as something magical or scientifi c. Certain psychological aspects of\nhuman nature are based on proven science and can be relied upon. As a matter\nof fact, some of these aspects are so impressive that they can make you seem like a\nmind reader. Some of them have been a topic of serious debate and some accepted\nby psychologists, law enforcement, and social engineers for years. Th e next section\nof this chapter discusses these, starting with microexpressions.\nMicroexpressions\nYou are probably familiar with the idea of reading facial expressions. When some-\none is happy, sad, angry, or whatever, when someone feels it you can look at his or\nher face and see that emotion. What if someone tries to fake that expression, like\na fake smile? We have all done it, walking through the market and bumping into\n110 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nsomeone we just don’t like that much—we put on a “smile” and say, “Hey John, nice\nto see you. Say hi to Sally.”\nWe may act very pleasant and cordial, but inside we are feeling nothing but\nirritation. Th e expressions that we show for longer periods of time on our face are\ncalled macroexpressions and are generally easier for people to see the emotion that\nis being conveyed. Similar to microexpressions, macroexpressions are controlled\nby our emotions, but are not involuntary and often can be faked.\nA certain few pioneers into the study of human behavior have spent decades\nresearching something, coined microexpressions, to understand how humans relay\nemotions.\nMicroexpressions are expressions that are not easily controllable and occur in\nreaction to emotions. An emotion triggers certain muscular reactions in a face\nand those reactions cause certain expressions to appear. Many times these expres-\nsions last for as short as one-twenty-fi fth of a second. Because they are involuntary\nmuscular movements due to an emotional response, they are nearly impossible to\ncontrol.\nTh is defi nition is not a new understanding either; Charles Darwin wrote a book\nin 1872 called, Th e Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. In this book\nDarwin noted the universal nature of facial expressions and how muscles were used\nin facial expressions.\nIn the early 1960s two researchers, Haggard and Isaacs, fi rst discovered what today\nis called microexpressions. In 1966, Haggard and Isaacs outlined how they discovered\nthese “micromomentary” expressions in their publication titled, Micromomentary\nFacial Expressions as Indicators of Ego Mechanisms in Psychotherapy.\nAlso in the 1960s, William Condon, a pioneer who studied hours of tapes frame by\nframe, discovered that humans had “micro-movements.” He also heavily researched\nneurolinguistic programming (more on that later) and body language.\nProbably one of the most infl uential researchers in the fi eld of microexpressions\nis Dr. Paul Ekman. Dr. Ekman pioneered microexpressions into the science it is today.\nDr. Ekman has been studying microexpressions for more than 40 years, receiving\nthe Research Scientist Award as well as being labeled one of Time Magazine’s most\ninfl uential people on earth in 2009.\nDr. Ekman researched facial expressions with psychologist Silvan Tomkins. His\nresearch revealed that, contrary to popular belief, emotions are not culturally deter-\nmined, but are universal across cultures and biological.\nWorking with Dr. Maureen O’Sullivan he developed a project called the Wizards\nProject. He began to pioneer the use of microexpressions in lie detection. He used\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 111\na base of 15,000 people from all walks of life and all cultures and found out of that\nlarge number that only 50 had the ability to spot a deception without training.\nIn the 1970s Dr. Ekman developed FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to label\nand number each conceivable human expression. His work branched out to not only\ninclude facial expressions but also how the whole body was involved in deception.\nBy 1972, Dr. Ekman had identifi ed a list of expressions that were linked with\nbasic or biologically universal emotions:\n» Anger\n» Disgust\n» Fear\n» Joy\n» Sadness\n» Surprise\nDr. Ekman’s work began to take on a following, and many law enforcement\nand corporate environments began to use this research in detecting deception.\nIn 1990, in a paper entitled “Basic Emotions,” Dr. Ekman revised his original list\nto include a range of positive and negative emotions (www.paulekman.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2009/02/Basic-Emotions.pdf). Dr. Ekman has published many\nbooks on emotions, facial expressions, and lie detection that can help each person\nto understand the value in being able to decode facial expressions.\nTh is brief history indicates that the subject of microexpressions is not some\nfantasy; on the contrary, real doctors, researchers, and professionals in the fi eld of\nhuman behavior have put countless hours into understanding microexpressions. As\na social engineer, understanding microexpressions can go a long way toward protect-\ning your clients and teaching them how to notice subtle hints of deception.\nIf you are a social engineer, or just a person interested in learning about micro-\nexpressions, I strongly suggest reading Dr. Ekman’s books, especially Emotions\nRevealed and Unmasking the Face. He is truly the authority on this topic. Th e fol-\nlowing sections describe the microexpressions in a simplistic format so you can see\nhow you can use this later on as a social engineer.\nAs mentioned earlier, Dr. Ekman labeled six main microexpressions and later\non added contempt to the list, making seven. Th e following sections cover these\none by one.\n112 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nAnger\nAnger is usually easier to spot than some other expressions. In anger the lips become\nnarrow and tense. Th e eyebrows slant downward and are pushed together—then\ncomes the most noticeable characteristic of anger, the glare.\nAnger is a strong emotion and can trigger many other emotions along with it.\nSometimes when a person feels anger at something, what you see is a microexpres-\nsion such as that shown in Figure 5-1. What makes it hard to see is that the facial\nmovements may last only one-twenty-fi fth of a second.\nE\nP\n.D\nFigure 5-1 Notice the glare, tense lips and tightened brows.\nLearning to see a specifi c microexpression can greatly enhance your under-\nstanding of people. To learn how to do so, Dr. Ekman recommends practicing that\nexpression on yourself. He says follow these steps:\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 113\n1. Pull your eyebrows down and together; pretend you are trying to touch\nyour nose with the inner parts of your eyebrows.\n2. While your brows are down, try to open your eyes wide, without adjust-\ning your brow position.\n3. Press your lips together tight. Do not pucker your lips, just tense them\ntogether.\n4. Glare.\nWhat emotion do you feel? Th e fi rst time I did this, I was overwhelmed with\nanger. Th e following is a vital point to this chapter:\nIf producing the facial expression can cause the emotion, that must\nmean that our facial movements can affect the emotions we feel,\nand maybe even the emotions of those around us.\nPractice this emotion in a mirror until you get it right. Figure 5-2 shows a picture\nof a young woman showing us exactly how anger is displayed.\nIt is just as pronounced as in Figure 5-1 and the icy cold gaze gives it away too.\n.D\n|\n)G\nN(\nT\nFigure 5-2 Notice the definite expression of anger\non her face.\n114 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nMastering the ability to reproduce microexpressions will go a long a way toward\nunderstanding the emotion behind them. When you can successfully reproduce\nand decode a microexpression, you can understand the emotion that is causing it.\nAt that point you can understand the mental state of the person you are dealing\nwith. Not only reproducing them on yourself but also being able to see and read\nthem in others can be helpful in controlling the outcome of your social engineer-\ning engagements.\nDisgust\nDisgust is a strong emotion usually in reaction to something you really do not like.\nTh is “something” does not always have to be a physical object; it can also be some-\nthing that is based on a belief or feeling.\nA food that you truly hate can cause the feeling of disgust, which will trigger\nthis expression. What is amazing is even in the absence of the actual smell or sight\nof the food, the thought of it can cause the same emotion.\nWhen I was a teenager, I went to Disney World with a few friends. I am not,\nand I mean not, a fan of roller coasters. After much prodding I went on Space\nMountain, an indoor roller coaster. About halfway through I had determined that\nI really didn’t mind roller coasters when suddenly I was smeared with something\nvery wet and chunky. I was then hit with an odor that I can only describe as stom-\nach contents. Not only me, but many behind me had the same reaction and none\nof us could hold back our lunch, so to speak. Before you knew it, a simultaneous\npuking splattered the glass of the Tomorrowland Transit Authority, a slow-moving\nobservation ride that off ers a peek into the actual Space Mountain ride on part\nof its journey. What is amazing is that people in the Tomorrowland ride who sat\nthere slowly going around the park saw the aftereff ects hit the glass as they rode\nthrough, and saw all the other riders getting physically ill, which made them also\nvomit—yet they didn’t smell the odor or have physical contact with the puke from\nthe roller coaster riders. Why?\nDisgust. Bodily fl uids generally bring on feelings of disgust and this is one reason\nthat while reading this paragraph you probably started to exhibit the expressions\nof disgust.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 115\nDisgust is often characterized by the upper lip being raised to expose the teeth,\nand a wrinkling of the nose. It may also result in both cheeks being raised when\nthe nose is wrinkled up, as if to try to block the passage of the bad smell or thought\ninto one’s personal space.\nWhat ever the man in Figure 5-3 just saw, it caused a very noticeable display of\ndisgust.\n.\n|\nM\n©\nFigure 5-3 Clear signs of disgust with his nose\nwrinkled and a raised upper lip\nDisgust is one of those emotions, according to Dr. Ekman’s research, that is in\nreaction to the sight, smell, or even thought of something distasteful. From a social\nengineering standpoint this emotion might not lead you down paths of success, but\nit can surely help you to see whether you are hitting the mark with your target or\ncausing him or her to mentally shut down to your ideas.\nTh e odds are that if you cause disgust for any reason in your target, you have lost.\nIf your appearance, smell, style, breath, or other aspect of your person can make a\nperson feel disgust, then it will most likely close the door to success. You must be\naware of what is acceptable and unacceptable to your targets. For example, if your\naudit is for a prestigious law fi rm and you have many piercings or tattoos, a very\nstrong negative emotion may rise in your target, which can close the door to your\nsocial engineering attempt. If you see a facial expression similar at all to Figure 5-4\nthen you know it is time to leave the scene.\n116 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFigure 5-4 If you see this expression, something is wrong.\nYou must seriously consider your appearance when working on your pretext. If\nyou happen to notice the strong negative emotion of disgust in your target, then\nbacking down and politely excusing yourself to rework your pretext or fi nd a dif-\nferent path in may be a good idea.\nContempt\nContempt is a very strong emotion that is often confused with disgust because it\nis so closely linked. Dr. Ekman didn’t even include contempt on his fi rst list of the\nbase emotions.\nIn Dr. Ekman’s book Emotions Revealed he says, “Contempt is only experienced\nabout people or the actions of people, but not about tastes, smells, or touches.” He\nthen gave an example of eating calf brains, which might be disgusting to you as\na thought, and will trigger disgust. Yet seeing someone eating them may trigger\ncontempt for the person committing the act, not the act itself.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 117\nTh e fact that contempt is directed at a person rather than an object is crucial to\nunderstanding the microexpressions that go along with it. Being able to see whether\nthe person you are dealing with is feeling contempt can help you to pinpoint more\nclosely the reason for his or her emotion.\nContempt is distinguished by wrinkling the nose and raising the lip, but only on\none side of the face, whereas disgust is the raising of the whole lip and the wrinkling\nof the whole nose. A very subtle contempt expression can be seen in Figure 5-5\nwhereas a more pronounced one is shown in Figure 5-6.\nE\nP\n.D\nFigure 5-5 Notice the slight nose wrinkle and\nthe raising of only the right side of Dr. Ekman’s face.\nE\nP\n.D\nFigure 5-6 Notice the signs of contempt\nare more prominent in this picture.\nTry to mimic contempt, and if you are like me, you will quickly feel anger and\ncontempt in your heart. Performing this exercise and seeing how these reactions\naff ect you emotionally is interesting.\n118 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nContempt is often accompanied by anger, because the things that can cause\ncontempt in a person can also trigger strong negative emotions. Contempt is one\nemotion you want to avoid triggering in anyone with whom you are dealing, espe-\ncially if you are in a social engineering engagement.\nFear\nFear is often confused with surprise because the two emotions cause similar mus-\ncular reactions in the face. Recently while on a plane, I was about to write the sec-\ntion on happiness, but something amazing happened at that time that served as the\nimpetus for writing this section on fear instead.\nI am not a short man, being 6’3”, and not a small build, either. While I sat on the\nplane with a few hours to kill I thought I would take advantage of the time to work.\nLet me add that coach seats aren’t what they used to be. As I sat with my laptop open\nstaring off into space I pondered how to start the section I had intended to write. I\nsoon realized I was meant to start writing about fear, because the gentlemen next to\nme pulled out a water bottle and took a swig, but I didn’t see him recap the bottle.\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw his bottle falling from his hands and toward my\nkeyboard. My instant reaction was easily identifi ed as fear.\nMy eyes opened wide, while my eyebrows crunched together inward. My lips\npulled together and out towards my ears. Of course, I didn’t realize all this as it\nwas happening but afterward I was able to analyze what had happened and I knew\nI had felt fear. I then analyzed the way I felt my face move and determined that if I\nrepeated the expression I felt that same emotion all over again. I am sure I looked\nsimilar to what is seen is Figure 5-7.\nTry to see whether you can generate this emotion in yourself by following these\nsteps:\n1. Raise your eyebrows as high as they will go.\n2. Drop your mouth open slightly and pull the corners of your lips back.\n3. If you can, pull your eyebrows together while raising them as high as\nyou can.\nHow did you feel? How about in your hands and arms and your stomach? Did\nyou notice any semblance of fear? If not, try the exercise again but think back to a\ntime when you were in a situation (something similar to my plane experience, or a\ncar in front of you screeching to a halt) out of your control. See how you feel then.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 119\nE\nP\n.D\nFigure 5-7 Clear signs of fear.\nMost likely you will feel the emotion. A friend of mine sent me this picture of\nhis daughter’s fi rst roller coaster ride (Figure 5-8). You can clearly see the raised\neyebrows, eyes wide and the mouth open with lips pulled back.\nFrom a social engineering standpoint, fear is often used to cause people to react a\ncertain way. Malicious social engineers use fear tactics to get an unsuspecting user\nto click a banner or give up a valuable piece of information. For example, malicious\nbanners might claim “Your computer is infected with a virus. Click here to get fi xed\nnow!!” Th ese banners work against non-technical users who fear the virus and will\nclick, only to be infected at that point.\n120 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nS\nC\nFigure 5-8 This little girl is showing clear signs\nof fear on the roller coaster.\nOne company I worked with was hit by a malicious social engineer who used\nfear to gain access to the building. Knowing that the CFO was out of town on an\nimportant business meeting and could not be disturbed, the social engineer went\ninto the company as a tech support guy. He demanded access to the CFO’s offi ce,\nwhich was promptly denied. He then played this line, “Mr. Smith, your CFO, called\nme and told me that while he was away at this meeting I better come down and fi x\nhis e-mail problem and that if it is not fi xed while he is gone, heads will roll.”\nTh e secretary feared that if it didn’t get fi xed, she would be to blame. Would her\nboss really be angry? Could her job be at risk? Because she feared a negative outcome,\nthe secretary let the phony tech support guy in. If he was a skilled social engineer he\nmay have been watching her facial expressions and noticing whether she exhibited\nsigns of worry or anxiety, which are related to fear. He then could have played on\nthese signs more and more, getting her to cave in to her fear.\nFear can be a big motivator to do many things that you (or your target) would\nnot normally consider doing.\nSurprise\nAs mentioned earlier, Dr. Ekman and many other psychologists in the area of micro-\nexpressions have concurred that surprise is closely linked to fear because of certain\nsimilarities. Even so, some marked diff erences exist, such as the direction the lips\ntake and the way the eyes react.\nTry this exercise to show surprise:\n1. Raise your eyebrows, not in fear but with the goal of widening your eyes\nas much as you can.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 121\n2. Let your jaw unhinge and open slightly.\n3. After you get the expression down pat try doing it quickly.\nI noticed I almost was forced to gasp in some air when I did it, causing me to feel\nsomething similar to surprise. You should see an expression similar to Figure 5-9.\nE\nP\n.D\nFigure 5-9 Notice the way the eyes and lips appear similar to fear.\nSurprise can be good or bad. Hearing your daughter’s fi rst words, of course, is a\ngood surprise. Or the surprise can be one of an event, statement, or question that\nyou didn’t expect that causes this response.\nAs you can see in Figure 5-10 whatever that woman must have seen really sur-\nprised her. Maybe a gift is being presented or something one of her grandchildren\nsaid to her. Notice her eyebrows raised and her jaw is unhinged and open. Th is\nkind of surprise is easy to see because it is so pronounced and the expressions are\neasy to pick out.\n122 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n.D\n|\n)K\nR(\nS\n©\nFigure 5-10 Often confused with fear,\nsurprise has some minor differences.\nIf the surprise is positive, it can often cause a smile or a jovial response after the\ninitial shock wears off . A social engineer can sometimes use surprise to open the\ntarget’s door, so to speak; following up with quick wit or a joke can quickly put the\ntarget at ease, causing the target to lower his or her guard.\nSadness\nSadness is an overwhelming and strong emotion. Sadness is one of those emotions\nthat we may feel ourselves when we see other people who are expressing this emo-\ntion. Some people can feel sadness just by seeing others who are sad, even to the\npoint of crying.\nTo show you how easily you can feel sadness, try this exercise:\n1. Drop your mouth open slightly.\n2. Pull the corners of your lips down.\n3. Hold your lips in place, and while doing that try to raise your cheeks as if\nyou are squinting.\n4. While maintaining that tension, look down and let your upper eyelids\ndroop.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 123\nMost likely you will begin to feel sadness. When I fi rst did this exercise, it was\noverwhelming for me. I instantly felt sad and found I had to control the length of\ntime I performed it because it caused me to be sad for quite a while. To see how this\nshould look, notice the expression in Figure 5-11.\nE\nP\n.D\nFigure 5-11 Notice the lips and eyes drawn back and down, signifying sadness.\nAnother aspect of sadness that makes it an amazing emotion is that it does not\nalways have to display as agony or extreme grief. Sadness can be very subtle. Sadness\ncan also be displayed in just one part of the face. People may try to hide sadness by\nusing a fake smile or what I call “stoic eyes,” where they stare straight ahead, almost\nin a daze, but you can tell they are trying to control the emotion they are feeling.\nTake a look at Figure 5-12. In this case you can see an example of sadness when\nhalf the face is covered. Th is woman is showing defi nite signs of sadness which can be\nnoticed even though her face is covered. Notice her brow is slightly furrowed as well\nher eyelids dropping and you can see the corners of her mouth pointing downward.\n124 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n.D\n|\n)S\nA(\nS\nFigure 5-12 Notice how the signs of sadness\nare visible in her eyes, brows and lips.\nTh e eyes are one of the best indicators to reading sadness. Th e expression is often\nconfused with tiredness and other emotions that can cause similar eye movements.\nTying in the body language with what is read on the face can also help to determine\nif it is sadness or another emotion.\nTh is can be especially true if you are dealing with other cultures. Particularly\nin cultures where much of the face is covered by clothing. In many Middle Eastern\ncultures where women cover much of their face, you may only be able to see the\npersons eyes. In these cases it will be very important for the social engineer to also\nuse body language to determine if what they are seeing is genuine sadness.\nSadness is often used in social engineering because it can trigger people to take\nan action such as donate money or give out information. You have probably seen\nit used in television commercials showing a very disadvantaged child. Th ese chil-\ndren may be malnourished, poverty stricken, and seemingly unloved, but for just a\nsmall donation you can bring a smile to the child’s face. Th e images of sad, crying,\nemaciated children will tug at your heartstrings. I am not suggesting that these\ncommercials are malicious social engineering, just that they use social engineering\nto a degree, by using an emotional trigger to get a reaction out of the target.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 125\nUnfortunately, malicious social engineers often use this emotional trigger to\nobtain things from their targets. I once walked into a restaurant and overheard a\nyoung man telling a group of older folks who were leaving that he just ran out of gas\non the highway and needed to get home because his wife was nine months pregnant.\nHe had been out of work and had just walked a mile off the highway to use the phone\nto call his wife and wondered if they could give him $20. When I heard some of the\nstory I slowed down and made believe I was on a phone call to observe the rest. He\ntold his tale and then backed it up with, “Look if you give me your address, I will\nmail you a check for the $20,” concluding with “I swear to God.”\nTh e story had some elements in it that could elicit compassion, especially when\nhis face showed concern, anxiety, and sadness. He didn’t get $20—he was given $20\nby each of the three people in that group. He said “God bless you” a few times and\ngave the group a few hugs and said he was going to go in to call his wife and tell her\nhe was on the way home. He hugged them and they left feeling as if they had done\ntheir good deed for the week.\nA few minutes later as I’m eating my meal, I see him at the bar drinking a couple\nof fully paid-for drinks with his buddies. Mixing a sad story with some sad facial\nexpressions, he had been able to manipulate the emotions of those around him.\nHappiness\nHappiness can have many facets to it—so many that I can probably make a chapter\njust on it, but that is not my focus. Dr. Ekman’s books cover many excellent points\nabout happiness and similar emotions and how they aff ect the person with the\nemotion and those around him or her.\nWhat I want to focus on are just a couple aspects of happiness—most importantly\nthe diff erence between a true smile and a fake smile. Th e true and the fake smile\nare an important aspect of human expressions to know how to read, and as a social\nengineer to know how to reproduce.\nHas there been a time where you met someone who was very pleasant but after\nyou parted ways your spouse or you yourself said, “Th at guy was a fake…”?\nYou might not have been able to identify the aspects of a true smile in your head\nbut something told you the person wasn’t being “real.” In the late 1800s a French\nneurologist, Duchenne de Boulogne, did some fascinating research into smiling.\nHe was able to attach electrodes to a man’s face and trigger the same “muscular”\nresponse in the face as a smile. Even though the man was using all the right muscles\n126 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nfor smiling, de Boulogne determined that the look of the man was still a “fake\nsmile.” Why?\nWhen a person smiles for real, de Boulogne indicates, two muscles are triggered,\nthe zygomaticus major muscle and the orbicularis oculi. Duchenne determined that\nthe orbicularis oculi (muscle around the eyes) cannot be triggered voluntarily and\nthat is what separates a real from a fake smile.\nDr. Ekman’s research concurs with Duchenne’s and although recent research\nindicates some can train themselves to think about triggering that muscle, more\noften than not a fake smile is all about the eyes. A real smile is broad with narrow\neyes, raised cheeks, and pulled-up lower eyelids. It has been said that a real smile\ninvolves the whole face, from the eyes to the mouth, as seen in Figure 5-13.\nFigure 5-13 Dr. Ekman demonstrates a fake smile (left) next to a real smile (right).\nIf you were to cover the top half of Dr. Ekman’s face you would be hard pressed\nto tell a real from a fake smile. It is not until you examine the eyes that it becomes\nclear, side by side, which smile is fake and which is real.\nWhen a person sees a real smile on another person’s face, it can trigger that same\nemotion inside of them and cause them to smile. Notice Figure 5-14, this man is\nshowing genuine happiness with a real smile. Notice how his whole face is involved\nin this smile.\nFrom a social engineering standpoint, knowing how to detect and also create a\nreal smile is a valuable piece of information. A social engineer wants a target to be\nput at ease, so as to have the greatest positive eff ect on the target.

    "summary": "The text explains how social engineers use psychological principles, such as identifying a person's dominant sense and leveraging microexpressions, to manipulate emotions and gain trust. It highlights the importance of understanding emotions like anger, disgust, fear, surprise, sadness, and happiness, as well as their subtle facial expressions, to effectively engage in social engineering. Dr. Paul Ekman's research on microexpressions is emphasized, showing how they can be used to detect deception and manipulate others' emotions for desired outcomes."

Quickly our brains analyze\nhow we feel about that visual input given to us and it can affect the rest of the\ninteraction.\nA lot of information is packed into the preceding section, yet you may be won-\ndering how social engineers can train themselves not only to see microexpressions\nbut also how to use them.\n|\n)N\nS(\nS\n©\n.D\nFigure 5-14 Notice how his whole face is involved in this smile.\nTraining Yourself to See Microexpressions\nHollywood often overstates the abilities of the characters that appear in movies\nand television. For example, in the new hit television show Lie To Me (based on Dr.\nEkman’s research) the main character, Dr. Lightman, can read microexpressions\nwith seemingly no eff ort, and what is even more amazing is he usually can tell why\nthe emotion is occurring.\nYet in real life, much of the research done by those in the fi eld, like Dr. Ekman,\nmeant sitting in front of prerecorded sessions and analyzing these sessions frame\nby frame. After many years of working on this task he is probably able to notice,\npick up, and analyze microexpressions very quickly. In the 1970s he did a research\nproject where he identifi ed some who had a natural ability to notice and correctly\nanalyze microexpressions.\nBecause many of us might not fall into that natural ability category we need a\nway to practice, train, and become profi cient at performing, reading, and using\nmicroexpressions. I can tell you what works for me. I read the methods on how a\nparticular microexpression is identifi ed, then practice reproducing it using a mirror,\n128 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ncomparing my expression to the notes from the professionals that describe how it\nis done. I usually have a picture that shows the emotion I am working on because\nhaving something to mimic helps me.\nAfter I feel relatively good about reproducing the microexpression I focus on\nhow it makes me feel, tweaking small areas until the muscular movements cause\nme to feel the matching emotions.\nI then scour the Internet looking for pictures and try to identify the expressions\nin those pictures. Next, I record news or television shows and play certain parts\nin slow motion with the sound off to see if can determine the emotion, then listen\nto the story to see if I was close. All this leads up to working with live “subjects.”\nI watch people interact with each other and try to identify the emotions they are\nfeeling during their discussions. I try both with being able to hear the conversation\nand also without being able to.\nTh e reason I chose this path before trying to read microexpressions in my own\nconversations is that I found that trying to do it in a live environment without\nhaving to also focus on making good conversation is easier. I just read the facial\nexpressions and do not get confused by other sensory input. Th e preceding method\nis the one I used before I had a chance to meet Dr. Ekman and be introduced to\nhis training methods. Of course, he has books that contain step-by-step instruc-\ntions on recreating and reading these expressions. His books also include pictures\nshowing the emotions as well as examples in the news that show those emotions.\nHis book Emotions Revealed does this in a very professional format that is excel-\nlent for learning.\nIn recent years Dr. Ekman has developed and released training specifi cally for\nmicroexpressions. His website, www.paulekman.com, has three diff erent types of\ntraining that have changed the way people can learn this powerful science.\nEkman’s training gives the user a lesson on each type of microexpression via video\nand text. Th e user can replay the expression video to see how each part of the face is\ninvolved. After the user spends as much time as needed learning and watching the\nvideo sections, she can take a pretest. Th e pretest enables her to see how good she is at\nnoticing microexpressions. When the user guesses at what microexpression is being\ndisplayed, she can get confi rmation or correction. If correction is needed then she can\ntake additional education and training.\nAfter the user is confi dent in her abilities she can take the real test. In the fi nal\nexam no correction is given. Th e user is shown a microexpression once for a brief\none twenty-fi fth of a second, and then she must select what the microexpression is\nand then wait to be graded at the end.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 129\nTh is type of training tool can take years off of your learning curve in becoming\nprofi cient at reading microexpressions. One caveat: Dr. Ekman, as well as his con-\ntemporaries, state that even though you may become profi cient in reading micro-\nexpressions, a microexpression is limited. What does that mean?\nOne of the tricks actors use to be able to successfully show proper emotion is\nto remember and focus on a time when they truly felt the emotion they need to\nportray; for example, a moment of happiness that produced a real smile. As men-\ntioned earlier, making a real smile is very diffi cult to fake if you aren’t truly feeling\nhappy, but if you can bring up a memory when you felt that emotion your muscles\nwill remember and react.\nTh erefore, although you can become profi cient at reading the emotion, you can-\nnot read the why behind it. Th e why is often lost to science. I had a friend who had\nsome bad experiences as a child with a person who closely resembled a good friend of\nmine. Whenever my friend would come around she had strong emotional reactions.\nIf you were to read her microexpression you would probably see fear, contempt, and\nthen anger on her face. She did not hate my friend, but she hated the person in her\nmemory who resembled my friend.\nTh is is a good point to remember when you are learning how to read microex-\npressions. Th e expression is linked to an emotion, but the expression doesn’t tell\nyou why the emotion is being displayed. I know when I fi rst started learning about\nmicroexpressions and then became somewhat “profi cient” at reading certain expres-\nsions, I felt like I was a mind reader. Although this is far from the truth, the caution\nis to not be assumptive. You may become very good at reading microexpressions;\nhowever, later sections discuss how to combine this skill with interrogation tactics,\nbody language skills, and elicitation skills to not only fi gure out what targets are\nthinking, but also to lead them down the path you want.\nThe question you still may have is, “How can I use these skills as a social\nengineer?”\nHow Social Engineers Use Microexpressions\nTh is whole section leads up to this: As fascinating as the research is, as amazing\nas the science is behind this psychology, how do you utilize microexpressions in a\nsocial engineer audit and how do malicious social engineers use them?\nTh is section discusses two methods of how to use microexpressions in social\nengineering. Th e fi rst method is using microexpressions (ME) to elicit or cause an\nemotion, and the second method is how to detect deceit.\n130 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nLet me start with the fi rst method, using your own ME to cause an emotional\nresponse in others. I recently read a research paper that changed my view of ME\nand opened my eyes to a new area of research. Researchers Wen Li, Richard E.\nZinbarg, Stephan G. Boehm, and Ken A. Paller performed a study called “Neural and\nBehavioral Evidence for Aff ective Priming from Unconsciously Perceived Emotional\nFacial Expressions and the Infl uence of Trait Anxiety” that changes the face of\nmicroexpression usage in modern science.\nTh e researchers connected dozens of mini-EKGs to muscle points on their sub-\njects’ faces. Th e devices would register any muscular movements in their face and\nhead. Th ey then played videos for them that had one-twenty-fi fth-second fl ashes of\nmicroexpressions in frames. Li et al., found that in almost every case the subject’s\nmuscular movement would begin to mirror that which was embedded in the video.\nIf it was fear or sadness, the subject’s facial muscles would register those emotions.\nWhen interviewed about the emotion the subject was feeling it was the emotion\nembedded in the video.\nTo me, this groundbreaking research proves that a person can manipulate another\nperson to a certain emotional state by displaying subtle hints of that emotion. I have\nstarted conducting some research into this from a security angle and I am calling it\n“neurolinguistic hacking,” mainly because it takes much from microexpressions as\nwell as neurolinguistic programming (discussed in the next section) and combines\nthem to create these emotional states within a target.\nImagine this scenario. A social engineer wants to walk into a company with the\ngoal of getting the receptionist to insert a malicious USB key into the computer. His\npretext is that he has a meeting with the HR manager, but on the way in, he spilled\ncoff ee all over his last resume. He really needs this job and to help, would she print\nhim out another copy of the resume?\nTh is is a solid pretext that tugs on the receptionist’s heartstrings and has worked\nfor me in the past. Yet, if the social engineer allows his own emotional state to run\nrampant he might be showing signs of fear, which is linked to nervousness. Th at\nfear can translate to an uneasy feeling in the receptionist and failure or rejection\nof the request. Whereas if he were to control his emotions and fl ash subtle hints of\nsad microexpressions, which is closely linked with empathy, then he might have a\nvery good chance at his request being honored.\nRecall the previous discussion of the commercials that encourage people to\ndonate “only a dollar a day” to feed a child in need. Before requesting money, before\nfl ashing a phone number and URL, before telling you that credit cards are accepted,\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 131\nmany long images of very sad children fl ash across your TV screen. Th ose images\nof children in need and children in pain put your brain in the emotional state that\nis needed to comply with the request.\nDo those commercials work on everyone? No, of course not. But although not\neveryone donates, it will aff ect almost everyone’s emotional state. Th at is how a social\nengineer can use ME to the fullest. Learning to exhibit the subtle hints of these ME\ncan cause the neurons in your target’s brain to mirror the emotional state they feel\nyou are displaying, making your target more willing to comply with your request.\nTh is usage of ME can be malicious, so I want to take a moment to talk about a\nmitigation (see also Chapter 9). Being aware of how ME can be used doesn’t mean\nyou need to start training everyone in your company to be an ME expert. What it\ndoes mean is that good security awareness training does need to occur. Even when\nrequests are designed to make you desire to help, desire to save, desire to nurture,\nthe security policy must take precedence. A simple, “I’m sorry we cannot insert\nforeign USB keys into our computers. But two miles down the road is a FedEx\nKinko’s shop. You can print another resume there. Should I tell Mrs. Smith you\nwill be a few minutes late?”\nIn this scenario, such a statement would have squashed the social engineer’s\nplans as well as given the target the feeling of being helpful.\nTo utilize the power of ME, sometimes you have to combine it with other aspects\nof human behavior as well. Th e second method, how to detect deceit, describes how\nyou can do this. Th e second method for using ME as a social engineer is in detecting\ndeception. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could ask a question and know whether the\nresponse was truth or not? Th is subject has been a source of heated debate among\nmany professionals who claim that eye patterns, body language, facial expression, or\na combination of all the preceding can indicate truth or deception. While some do\nnot believe this to be the case, others feel these can be used as an exact science.\nAlthough some truth may exist in each of those thoughts, how can you use\nmicroexpressions to detect deception?\nTo answer this question you must take into account more than just microexpres-\nsions because, as identifi ed throughout this section, microexpressions are based on\nemotions and reactions to emotions. Keep this in mind while reading this section,\nwhich analyzes some causes and eff ects.\nFour things can help you detect deceit in a target:\n» Contradictions\n» Hesitation\n132 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Changes in behavior\n» Hand gestures\nTh e following sections discuss these items in more detail.\nContradictions\nContradictions are particularly tricky because they often can and do occur in factual\naccounts. I know in my case I often forget details, and my wife will fi ll them in quickly.\nAfter I get a little hint here or there I often can remember the full story. Th is doesn’t\nmean that I am always lying at the beginning of a story or conversation, but I don’t\nalways remember all the details clearly enough to comment on them at fi rst, or I think\nI do remember the details but I really don’t. Even after I “remember” the details, the\ndetails may be my version of reality and not the way the story actually happened.\nTh is inadvertent dishonesty is important to consider when evaluating contra-\ndictions as a clue to lying. What a contradiction should do is prompt you to dig\nmore. Watching the person’s microexpressions while you question him about a\ncontradiction is also helpful.\nFor example, suppose you have developed a pretext as a visiting salesperson. You\nare going to try to gain physical access to the CEO to deliver a CD with a special\noff er. You know the CEO is very partial to a certain charity so you developed the\npretext around that. As you walk into the lobby the front desk person says, “Sorry,\nhe is not in, you can just leave it with me.”\nYou know that if you leave the CD a greater chance exists that your “malicious”\nCD will never be used. You also feel he is in because you see his car in the parking\nlot and you know today was a normal work day for him. With those facts in mind\nand without wanting to embarrass the front desk person you say, “Oh, he’s really\nnot? I called the other day and asked when I could visit and was told today was a\ngood day. Did I mix up my days?”\nIf you’ve played your cards right and your expressions are genuine, this can turn\nout two ways:\n» She may hold steady and again say, “Sorry, he’s not in.”\n» She may contradict herself (which can be a clue that she is not being\ntruthful): “Let me check whether he is in or not.”\nWhat? She went from a stern “He is not in” to “Let me check.” Th at contradic-\ntion is enough to signal that you should dig more. What was her ME when she did\nthat? Did she show shame or maybe some sadness at lying? Was she angry at being\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 133\ncaught in a lie? Was she embarrassed that she was wrong and maybe confused? You\ncannot automatically assume she is lying, because maybe she really didn’t know,\nand when you rebutted she decided to really fi nd out.\nAfter she confi rms whether he is in you can choose to dig a little deeper and\nprobe more to determine truthfulness if needed. Again, playing your card of “Maybe\nI mixed up my days” and watching her facial expressions can be a good indicator\nof her truthfulness or not.\nIf in your fi rst go-round you saw any hints of anger, continuing to enquire can\ncause her to be more angry and embarrassed and end your interaction. At this point,\nyou may want to ask something like, “If Mr. Smith isn’t in right now and I really mixed\nup my days or times, when can I stop in to see him? What time is the best?”\nTh is type of question allows her to save face, as well as gives you another oppor-\ntunity to read some facial expressions. If you didn’t notice anger but maybe saw she\nlooked a little sad or embarrassed then you might want to respond with empathy\nand understanding to open her up. “I could have sworn that he said today was a\ngood time to drop it off , but you know, my memory is so bad, my wife tells me I am\ngetting Alzheimer’s. I bought one of these smart phones, but I’ll be darned if I can\nfi gure it out. I don’t want to be a bother, but when can I just drop this off for him?\nI want to make sure it gets right into his hands.”\nBe very observant of minor contradictions as they can be key indicators in deceit\nand help you get your foot in the door.\nHesitation\nSimilarly to contradiction, you can use someone’s hesitation to detect a potential\nuntruth. If you ask a question and the answer should have come quickly from the\nperson, but he hesitates beforehand, it can be an indication that he was using the\ntime to fabricate an answer.\nFor example, when my wife asks me how much my new electronic gadget costs,\nshe knows I know the answer. A hesitation can mean either I am evaluating whether\nI want to answer truthfully or I might just be remembering the price.\nWhen I get a progress report from my son’s school that says he missed X num-\nber of days at school and I only know about two or three valid absences, I ask him\nwhere the rest of these missed days are from. If his answer was, “Dad, don’t you\nremember I had that doctor appointment and then you kept me home that day to\nhelp you with that project?” Most likely that is full-on truth because it was quick\nand has facts in the response. However, if he hesitates and comes back with, “Wow,\nI don’t know—maybe the report is wrong,” then noting his microexpression during\n134 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nhis response is a good idea. Does it indicate anger, maybe at being caught, or sadness\nat the imagined punishment? Either way, it is time for me to investigate more and\nfi nd out where he was those days.\nAnother thing to look out for is a well-known hesitation tactic of repeating the\nquestion back to you as if asking for verifi cation that the question is correct. Doing\nso allows for time to fabricate a response. Th e use of hesitation to detect deception\nis not an exact science, but it can be a good indicator. Some people just think before\nthey speak. I am from New York, so I speak fast. If someone speaks slower than\nme it is not an indication of deceit. You must be able to use the ME to determine if\nsomeone is just slow at speaking or trying to fabricate a response.\nIf the emotion does not match the question asked then it might be worth look-\ning into.\nChanges in Behavior\nDuring a discussion the target may change his behavior every time a certain topic is\nbrought up. Maybe you notice an expression change or a shift in the way he sits, or\na marked hesitation. All of these actions can indicate deceit. Whether these actions\namount to deceit is not certain, but they should cause you to probe more on the\ntopics being discussed in a way that does not alert suspicion. Th ese behaviors can\nbe signs that the person is using the time delays to generate a story, recall facts, or\ndecide whether he wants to reveal those facts.\nHand Gestures\nPeople often paint pictures with their hands using gestures. For example, someone\nmay use his hands to show how big something is, how fast something was going,\nor to show how many times something was said. Many professionals feel that when\nsomeone is being untruthful he will touch or rub his face often. Some psychologi-\ncal connection exists between rubbing the face and generating a fabrication. Some\nof the cues used by psychologists and body language experts to detect deceit are\ndiscussed here: www.examiner.com/mental-health-in-new-orleans/detecting-\ndeception-using-body-language-and-verbal-cues-to-detect-lies.\nTaking note of a change in the size, frequency, or duration of hand gestures dur-\ning a conversation is important. In addition, you should watch facial expressions\nduring gestures that can raise a fl ag in your mind.\nWhen you detect deceit, having a plan for how to respond is important and a good\nidea. In the earlier scenario with the front desk person and her “out-of-the-offi ce”\nboss, calling her out on her lie would most likely have raised all sorts of red fl ags,\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 135\nembarrassing her, and ruining any chances of success. If your pretext is someone\nwith authority, like a manager or department supervisor, and you catch someone in\na lie you can then use that to your advantage. By “forgiving” the person you are now\nowed a favor in return. But in the same scenario, if the position you are in is lower\n(someone in a non-management position such as a secretary, receptionist, or sales\nposition) than the target, playing that card can be dangerous. Th e authority action\nwould not fi t the pretext of someone in a non-management position.\nWhat it boils down to simply is that as a social engineer auditor you must learn\nto use a person’s microexpressions to determine whether he is presenting the truth\nor a lie and to determine whether you are aff ecting the target the way you want.\nIn some cases you can even use certain expressions to manipulate the target into\na certain state of mind.\nRemember, microexpressions alone are not enough to determine why an emotion\nis occurring. Determining that someone is angry or sad, for instance, doesn’t tell\nyou why that person is angry or sad. Be cautious when using microexpressions to\ntake into consideration all factors to determine, as closely as possible, the reason\nfor the emotion.\nMalicious social engineers employ these tactics of using microexpressions dis-\ncussed in this section but their goals are completely diff erent from those of a social\nengineer doing an audit. Th ey often don’t care about the residual eff ect on the target.\nIf damaging a person’s belief system, psychological stability, or even job stability can\nlead the malicious social engineer to a payday he will take that path.\nEarlier in this book you read about some scams that came up during the attacks\nin New York City after 9/11. People who saw an opportunity to cash in on people’s\nsympathy and the tragedy that occurred didn’t seem to care whether their actions\nhurt others. Many came out of the shadows claiming to have family who were lost\nin those attacks. Some of these malicious people received money, gifts, sympathy,\nand even media attention only for it to be discovered down the road that the stories\nwere all false accounts.\nTh e malicious social engineer spends a lot of time learning about people and\nwhat makes them tick. Th is knowledge makes locating an acceptable target to attack\neasier.\nTh is section just scratched the surface of microexpressions; the work of many pro-\nfessionals in the fi eld has fi lled volumes. Seek out training, become profi cient in read-\ning and using microexpressions, and you will see an increase in your c ommunication\nabilities with others. In addition, this profi ciency will enhance your ability to have\nsuccess in your audits.",
    "question": "How can social engineers use microexpressions to influence or detect emotions in their targets during an audit?",
    "summary": "The text explains how social engineers can train to recognize and use microexpressions, which are brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal true emotions. It discusses methods like practicing with mirrors, analyzing videos, and using real-life interactions to improve this skill. Additionally, it highlights how microexpressions can be used to elicit emotions or detect deception by observing subtle cues in a target's behavior and facial expressions. However, it also warns that microexpressions alone cannot determine the underlying reasons for emotions, and that ethical considerations must be taken into account when using these techniques."

    "text": "136 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nNeurolinguistic Programming (NLP)\nNeurolinguistic programming (NLP) studies the structure of how humans think\nand experience the world. It is very controversial in itself because the structure of\nNLP does not lend itself to precise, statistical formulas. Many scientists will argue or\ndebate the principles of NLP due to this fact, but the structure does lead to models of\nhow the principles work. From these models, techniques for quickly and eff ectively\nchanging thoughts, behaviors, and beliefs that limit people have been developed.\nAs stated in Wikipedia (source: Oxford English Dictionary), neurolinguistic pro-\ngramming is “a model of interpersonal communication chiefl y concerned with the\nrelationship between successful patterns of behavior and the subjective experiences\n(esp. patterns of thought) underlying them,” and “a system of alternative therapy\nbased on this which seeks to educate people in self-awareness and eff ective com-\nmunication, and to change their patterns of mental and emotional behavior.”\nTh is book is far from a self-help book, so although the principles in it can assist\nin changing deep-seated thought patterns and habits in yourself, its focus is on how\nyou can use NLP to understand and then manipulate those around you.\nIf you are unfamiliar with NLP your fi rst instinct may be to run to a computer\nand type the term into Google. I want to ask you not to do that just yet. You will fi nd\nthat similar to social engineering, what you will often fi nd fi rst are many videos and\ndemonstrations that just seem very unrealistic, such as videos of someone touching\nanother person’s shoulder and changing that person’s brain patterns to think brown\nis white or somesuch. Th ese videos make out NLP to be some form of mysticism,\nand for those who are leery of these things, these types of videos discredit it.\nInstead the following sections break NLP down into a few parts. Up next is a\nvery brief history of NLP, which can help you to understand that its roots are not\nwith street magicians; instead, it has deep psychological roots.\nThe History of Neurolinguistic Programming\nNeurolinguistic programming (NLP) was developed in the 1970s by Richard\nBandler and John Grinder with the guidance of Gregory Bateson. Its roots came\nfrom Bandler and Grinder’s research into some of the most successful therapists\nof their time.\nFrom this initial research they developed the “code” concepts of NLP. Th is early\nresearch led to the development of a meta-model, which recognizes the use of lan-\nguage patterns to infl uence change.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 137\nBoth Bandler and Grinder were students at the University of California and\nused the principles of their research to develop a therapy model called the meta-\nmodel. After writing a few books based on this model they began to refi ne the core\nprinciples that would become what we call NLP today. Th is included things like\nanchoring, swish pattern, reframing, belief change, nesting loops, chaining states,\nand submodalities applications.\nAfter graduating with degrees in psychology, Bandler and Grinder began hosting\nseminars and practice groups, which served as places for them to practice and test\ntheir newly discovered patterns while allowing them to transfer the skills to the\nparticipants. During this period, a creative group of students and psychotherapists\nwho formed around Grinder and Bandler made valuable contributions to NLP,\nhelping refi ne NLP even more.\nIn the recent years, NLP became the new buzzword again for managers, driving\nrapid growth of trainers, classes, and experts. Without any regulating body, the fi eld\ngrew as everybody wanted to learn to control others, lie without getting caught, or\nsolve all their psychological problems. Practitioners were not licensed, so each group\ntaught its own form and concept of NLP and issued its own certifi cation as experts.\nAll of this is what led to NLP being viewed somewhat unfavorably.\nDespite its rocky history, the core foundation of NLP can enhance your abilities\nas a social engineer. Th e next section discusses some of the core codes of NLP so\nyou can analyze them more deeply.\nCodes of Neurolinguistic Programming\nIn the early 1970s NLP had a code comprised of the collective body of learning and\ninvestigation that generated the fi rst books and the term neurolinguistic program-\nming. As time went on John Grinder and others have continued to contribute to\nthe fi eld of NLP. Th e “new code of NLP” is an ethical and aesthetic framework for\nNLP development.\nNew Code of NLP\nNLP’s original ideas were born in the 1970s. As time passed, John Grinder began\nto realize that much of the old code must change to be brought into modern times.\nHe began working with Gregory Bateson and Judith DeLozier and produced the\n“new code” that focused more on what the person thinks or believes will happen\nand changing that belief. Learning techniques for expanding your perceptions,\novercoming old thought patterns, and changing habits all help in self-change.\n138 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh e new code focuses on the key concepts of states, conscious/unconscious rela-\ntionships, and perceptual fi lters, all of these pointing to states of your mind and\nyour perception of those mental states. Th ese new concepts are meant to move NLP\nforward and help practitioners think about it in new ways. Many of the basic tenets\nfrom the new code are being taught now as part of the standard NLP courseware.\nTh is new code is best understood by reading Turtles All the Way Down by Grinder\nand DeLozier. It’s compiled from their seminar “Prerequisites to Personal Genius.”\nIn essence, the new code states that to make a change the client must involve\ntheir unconscious mind, the new behavior must satisfy their original positive inten-\ntion, and the change must occur internally at the state of mind rather than at the\nbehavioral level. Th is new code suggests how NLP can create serious and drastic\nchanges to a person’s thinking.\nTh is is a key concept for social engineers because, as you investigate and analyze\nthe new code, you will begin to see how it can be used to manipulate others. Before\ndoing that, though, you need to understand the scripts that the new code uses.\nScripts in the New Code\nPeople tend to have common problems, so groups of scripts have been developed to\nhelp therapists use NLP in their practice. Th ese scripts lead the participant through\na series of thoughts that help guide the person to the desired end. Several good\nbooks on NLP scripts exist, with Th e Big Book of NLP Techniques: 200+ Patterns &\nStrategies of Neuro Linguistic Programming being highly recommended.\nAn example of one script is an outline of how to increase your sales by getting\nsomeone to start talking about their dreams. Once you have them talking about\ncertain goals or aspirations, you can posit your product or service as answering one\nof the needs to reach those goals. By positively building on your product as fi tting a\nneed they have, you give your potential sale’s brain a way to connect your product\nwith positive sales.\nIf you take time to Google much of the information included here you will see\nthat NLP can take on a life of its own. You can take many angles and paths when\nstudying NLP. Despite all the plethora of information out there the question remains,\nhow can a social engineer use NLP?\nHow to Use NLP as a Social Engineer\nMany of the scripts and principles of NLP tend to lean toward hypnosis and similar\navenues. Even though you will not use hypnosis to social engineer a target, you can\nuse many of the principles of NLP as a social engineer. For example, NLP can teach\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 139\nyou how to use your voice, language, and choice of words to guide people down\nthe path you want.\nVoice in NLP\nYou can use your voice to inject commands into people just as you would use code\nto inject commands into a SQL database. Th e way you say things is where the injec-\ntion occurs; this single moment of injection is framed within regular conversation.\nSometimes how you say something is more important than what you say.\nNLP promotes the use of embedded commands to infl uence a target to think a\ncertain way or take a certain action. Also, using the tones of your voice to empha-\nsize certain words in a sentence can cause a person’s unconscious mind to focus\non those words. For example:\nFor instance, ask “Don’t you agree?” Instead of putting an upswing on the word\n“agree,” like you would normally at the end of a question, put a downswing to make\nthe question more of a command.\nAnother one I have heard used eff ectively is, “My customers usually do the things\nI say. Do you want to begin?” Th e way that sentence is used and surrounded by other\nstatements can make this a very commanding statement.\nMore on this in the next section, but this skill alone can change the way you\ninteract with others; the principles for it are steeped in NLP.\nSentence Structure\nIn English, the sound of the person’s voice at the end of sentence indicates whether\nwhat is being said is a question, statement, or command. A person’s voice goes up at\nthe end of a sentence for questions. Th e voice stays the same through the end of the\nsentence in statements, and the voice lowers at the sentence close for commands.\nFor the next few paragraphs, the bold font denotes to lower (deepen) your voice\ntone.\nTry this exercise: When you ask a question such as, “Is that your dog?” your\nvoice will rise at the end of that sentence. Yet you can embed subtle commands into\nsentences by just changing them to a downward point during the sentence, not at\nthe end. Here are a few simple commands for you to practice. Notice how they have\nthe command injected inside the sentence.\n“Remember how clean your room looked last Christmas?” Th e embedded com-\nmand is “clean your room,” which includes a time shift to a happier time. Th is is\nan example of a pleasant, painless injection.\n140 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n“Buy now, you can see the benefi ts!” Th is one starts with the voice low, then up\nto a normal tone, then back down for benefi ts.\n“Th e higher my company goes in consulting, the more nice people like you we\nencounter.” Implanting the higher my company with a pleasant comment has just\nincreased your chance of being hired, partly because of the play on words (Higher\nsounds like hire—thus what the listener hears is hire my company).\nFrom a social engineering standpoint you can form sentences when performing\nan audit over the phone to maximize the potential for success, such as:\n“Th is is Larry from tech support; we are giving all reps new passwords. Your\nnew password is…”\nTh e following are tips for using your voice in successful social engineering:\n» Practice. You have to practice speaking in this manner so you don’t\nsound like a teenage boy entering puberty. Your rising and falling tones\ncan’t sound canned; they must be subtle.\n» Have careful sentence structure. Develop sentences that maximize\nyour ability to accomplish your tasks. Don’t go for the kill, so to speak. A\ncommand like “give me access to your server room now” is probably not\ngoing to work, but you can use these voice techniques to help a target be\nmore open to the idea.\n» Be realistic. Don’t expect to speak and have people falling at your feet to\ndo what you ask. Th ese techniques can put your target in a frame of mind\nthat will make getting what you want easier.\nOne technique, Ultimate Voice, if mastered, does have very powerful eff ects. I once\ninterviewed an NLP practitioner on a podcast who had this gift. When he spoke it was\nas if you could not argue with him. He spoke with such control and technique that\ndisagreement never even entered my mind. How can one master this technique?\nUsing Ultimate Voice in Social Engineering\nYou can master the Ultimate Voice but it takes lots of practice. Th e ability to embed\ncommands into normal conversation is a skill that is very useful when mastered.\nUltimate voice is the ability to inject commands into people’s minds without their\nknowledge. It can sound very artifi cial when new people try it, until enough practice\nmakes them sound natural.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 141\nHypnotists often use this technique like so:\n“You can feel yourself relaxing as you slip into calmness.”\nTh is standard therapy phrase can be adapted to nearly any command you like.\nPut extra emphasis on the vowels in the words you want to accent—for example,\n“yooouurseeelf reelaaxiing.”\nPlanet NLP (www.planetnlp.com/) off ers three exercises that you can use to\nwork on mastering this technique.\n1. Move your voice around. Press your hand on your nose and say “nose.”\nConcentrate on your nose as you repeat the word until you can feel your\nnose vibrating. Now do the same exercise with your hand on your throat,\nsaying “throat.” Do the same on your chest, saying “chest.” Keep practic-\ning until you can really feel the vibration in each place. Notice how diff er-\nent each one sounds.\n2. Use your range. Starting from a high note, say “ar” (as in the letter r).\nKeeping your mouth open, allow the note to drop down until your breath\nruns out.\nRepeat this exercise ten times.\nThen, starting from a low note, say “ou” (as in you without the y),\nallowing the note to rise until you cannot support the sound.\nRepeat this exercise ten times.\n3. Resonate. To use your voice correctly, it must resonate in the mask,\nwhich is the facial area surrounding the nose and mouth.\nThere are two ways to practice resonating:\n» Hum at whatever pitch is most comfortable for you. After you have\nfound your pitch then hum “umm” followed immediately by the\nword “ready.” Do this a few times, then try the words “now,” “one,”\n“two,” and “three.”\n» Hum and then allow your lips to vibrate. You are attempting to\nsound like a dove. Allow the pitch to rise and fall. This is very dif-\nficult if you have any tension in the jaw or face. Done correctly for\na few minutes, your face will start to feel numb.\nAfter a couple of minutes using these methods, you should notice that your voice\nsounds crisper. If you fi nd it hard to notice, record yourself and listen back to see\nhow it sounds to you.\n142 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh e best way to improve is to spend about fi ve minutes a day going through\nthese exercises.\nPractice can help you to learn to control this vocal technique. For example, I am\ngenerally a loud person. It seems like I don’t have the ability to whisper. For me to\ncontrol my tones, pitch, and volume, I need practice. Doing simple voice exercises\nlike these can help you to control these voice characteristics.\nWhen you speak a sentence in which you want to include a hidden command,\nand you want to lower your tone, being so subtle that the target doesn’t realize it\nis imperative. Otherwise, you will alert that person’s subconscious to trigger that\nsomething is amiss. If that occurs he may pick up on your attempts thereby shut-\nting down your success.\nLike most things in social engineering, if a technique doesn’t come naturally,\npractice is essential. Try this voice technique on your family and friends before you\never attempt it in an audit.\nFrom personal experience, when I fi rst started working on the Ultimate Voice\ntechniques I decided my goal was to embed commands into questions. Th is goal\ntook a while to realize but I would try simplistic things like:\n“Honey, what do you want to eat for dinner tonight, steak or something else?”\nTo conclude this section, consider three things a social engineer should focus\non when studying NLP:\n» Vocal tones. As stated previously, the tones of your voice as well as the\nemphasis you put on certain words can change the whole meaning of a\nsentence. Using tone and emphasis, you can embed commands inside of\nthe subconscious mind of the target and allow the target to be more open\nto suggestion.\n» Chose your words carefully. Learn to choose the words that have maxi-\nmum impact. Match positive words with thoughts you want the target to\nthink positively on and negative words with those you want them to not\nthink of too highly. Th is technique can also help the social engineer make\na target more pliable.\n» Create a list of command sentences that you can use in person or\nduring a phone social engineering audit. Writing out and practicing\ncommand sentences will help you be able to recall and use them when\nin need.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 143\nMost of all, practice. Controlling your vocal tones, the words you choose, and how\nyou say them is not an easy task. Practice can make this become second nature.\nNLP is a powerful topic, and, much like microexpressions, this section only\nscratched the surface. Once you start to master the techniques in NLP and the abil-\nity to read facial expressions, a next logical step is using these tools when interacting\nwith a target. Next, this chapter analyzes the same tactics professional interroga-\ntors use.\nInterview and Interrogation\nScenario 1: Th e door fl ies open and the perpetrator is noticeably nervous. Captain\nBad-Mood comes over and grabs the perp by the collar and slams him up against\nthe wall. Getting about an inch from his face he screams, “You’ll tell me what I want\nto know, one way or another!”\nScenario 2: Th e bad guy is tied to a chair, already bruised from the previous\n30 minutes of beatings, and as the interrogator grabs a pair of shiny pliers he says,\n“You’ll be talking in no time….”\nScenario 3: Th e perp is sitting in a chair and two police offi cers enter the room.\nCalmly they walk over to the table and set a fi le labeled “Evidence” down on the table.\nBefore they sit down they ask, “Do you need a coff ee or a soda or something?”\nCracking open an ice-cold soda the fi rst offi cer says, “Th anks for coming in today\nto help us out….”\nWhich one of the preceding scenarios is a real-life interrogation? If you guessed\nthe third one, you’re right. It is how a real interrogation often goes. Th e fi rst two\nhave been portrayed in Hollywood movies and television series so much that many\nof us might think they are real. Outside of wartime scenarios and nations that do\nnot ban the use of torture, the third scenario is most likely the way most interroga-\ntions begin.\nRarely will you as a social engineer be in a situation where your target is wait-\ning in a room for you to question him. With that in mind, you might ask, how\ncan you use the tactics of professional interrogators and interviewers as a social\nengineer?\nBefore going further you should know the diff erences between an interrogation\nand an interview. Th e following table presents some of these diff erences, but this\ntopic has many diff erent angles, viewpoints, and opinions, so more could exist.\n144 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nInterview Interrogation\nSubject talks, you listen. You talk to subject about his statements.\nSubject leads direction of conversation; You lead direction.\nyou clarify his statements and listen, then\nApply NLP skills here.\napply NLP skills.\nNon-accusatory. Accusatory.\nSoft in nature. Hard in nature.\nSubject’s location, subject at ease. Interrogation room, subject is tense.\nYou gather information (who, what, when, If you reveal certain information, you can\nwhere, why, and how). learn details.\nEarly in investigation. Final questioning session.\nTh e main diff erence between an interview and interrogation is that an interview\nis in an atmosphere where the target is comfortable both physically and psycho-\nlogically, whereas in an interrogation the goal is to put some pressure on the target\nby creating discomfort with the location or the questions asked, with the goal of\ngaining a confession or some knowledge the target possesses.\nGood interrogation is an art that you can master through experience. Many\nsocial engineering skills tie into to being a good interrogator. Skills like elicitation\n(see Chapter 3); reading people, faces, and gestures; and having insight into human\nbehavior can all help you become a legendary interrogator.\nInterviewing is a great skill to have, but as long as you can master the use of\nelicitation you can become great at conducting interviews.\nInterrogation principles are used widely by successful social engineers. Putting\na target in some psychological or physical discomfort to make gathering informa-\ntion from them easier is a skill most social engineers will spend a considerable time\nobtaining.\nProfessional Interrogation Tactics\nBefore conducting any interview or interrogation, the social engineer will need to\nhave done thorough information gathering. You must obtain as much information\nabout the target, the company, the situation, and details of each as possible. You\nmust know how to approach a target and what to say, and have in mind the path\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 145\nyou will take with the target. Be careful to observe your surroundings as well as any\nchanges in the target during the conversation and initial approach.\nOne of the mistakes people new to interviewing and interrogation make is assum-\ning every behavioral change has major meaning. A target’s crossing her arms doesn’t\njust mean a closed thought; she could also be cold, have underarm stink, or feel\nincreased stress because of your questions.\nWatch not for only one sign; watch for groups of signs. For example, a target\ncrosses her arms, turns her head, and places her feet fl at on the fl oor. Th is is a closed\nperson; in other words, her body language indicates that she will divulge no more\ninformation or cooperate any longer—this door has been shut. A group of changes\nis the most important thing to watch for, so note the topic that was being discussed\nwhen the group of changes occurred.\nWhen starting an interview or interrogation here are areas to observe for changes\nin the subject:\n» Body posture: Upright, slumped, leaning away\n» Skin color: Pale, red, white, changes\n» Head position: Upright, tilted, forward/back\n» Eyes: Direction, openness\n» Hands/feet: Movement, position, color\n» Mouth/lips: Position, color, turned up/down\n» Primary sense: Visual, aural, kinetic, feeling\n» Voice: Pitch, rate, changes\n» Words: Short, long, number of syllables, dysfunctions, pauses\nChanges can indicate a question or line of questioning that needs more attention.\nFor example, if the body posture is very relaxed when you ask, “Is Mr. CEO in? I\nwould like to leave this information packet for his review,” and then the body posture\nchanges to a defensive posture—the torso pointing away and the eyes averting from\nlooking at you—it may be a good indication that there is some untruth coming up\nand further questioning might reveal the truth on this topic.\nEspecially be sure to pay attention to the words a target uses. During the inter-\nview or interrogation process, pay particular attention to the subject’s voice and\nhow she answers questions. When you ask a question, how long does it take for her\nto answer? Blurting out answers quickly is believed to be a sign of practicing the\nanswer. If she takes too long, maybe she was thinking up the answer. Response time\n146 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ndepends on each person, though, because you have to determine what is “natural”\nfor each person.\nDetermining what is natural in a target (that is, the baseline) is not a small mat-\nter in a social engineering gig and must be done very fast. Being very observant is\nthe key to success with this skill. One method of creating a baseline involves asking\nquestions that cause the suspect to access diff erent parts of his brain. Th e inter-\nrogator asks nonthreatening questions that require simple memory and questions\nthat require creative thinking. Th en look for outward manifestation of his brain\nactivating the memory center, such as microexpressions or body language cues.\nAnother area to listen for is changes in verb tense and pronoun use. Th ese shifts\nfrom past tense to future tense show areas you might want to investigate further.\nSwitching tense can indicate deception. When a target switches tense they may be\nfabricating an answer or thinking of a past statement to fabricate an answer. Further\nquestioning can reveal the truth here also. Other areas of change you should listen\nto are the pitch of the voice (is it going up with stress?) and the speed of speaking.\nYou don’t have to learn how to do all this at the same time. Th e more practice\nyou get actively listening and observing people the easier it becomes for you to do\nit without thinking.\nProfessional interrogation is comprised of a number of parts. Th e following sec-\ntions discuss each one, in the context of how it pertains to a social engineer.\nPositive Confrontation\nIn law enforcement positive confrontation doesn’t mean anything positive and good;\non the contrary, it means the offi cer is telling the suspect he is the one who com-\nmitted the crime; in other words, the offi cer is making a strong accusation. In a\nsocial engineering audit, though, you already have identifi ed the “target” you want\nand now you are going to tell (maybe using the NLP tactics previously mentioned)\nthat target that he will do what you are asking of him.\nYou confront the target with the objective of starting him on the path to doing\nwhat you want. For example, a social engineer may approach the receptionist and\nask, “Is Mr. CEO in? I have a meeting with him.” Or, to use a positive-confrontation\nangle, “I am here for my meeting with Mr. CEO at 11 am.” Notice the second\nexample positively states the meeting as being set, expected, and in such a way that\nyou are sure it is happening.\nTheme Development\nTh eme development in police interrogations is when the interrogator develops a\nstory to postulate why the suspect may have committed a crime. Many times that\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 147\nstory is relayed to the suspect during the interrogation. “So he insulted you and you\ngot so mad, you grabbed the pipe and began hitting his windshield with it.” While\nthe offi cer is telling the story, he or his partner is watching the body language and\nmicroexpressions of the suspect to see if there are any clues that would constitute\nagreement.\nAlthough social engineers can use this method, I also like to state that from a\nsocial engineering viewpoint, theme development needs to be seeing your pretext\nfrom the eyes of the target. What would a “tech support rep,” “manager,” or “fellow\nemployee” look like, say, and do? How would he act?\nTh eme development for social engineers is when your supporting evidence that is\ndisplayed feeds directly into the theme of who you are portraying. Your approach to a\ntarget, whether on the phone or in person, often involves a pretext of some sort. Th e\npretext, of course, supports your storyline or theme. Th is part of the interrogation is\nwhere you off er reasons or support for the pretext (see Chapter 4 for a refresher on\npretexting).\nFor example, in one audit my pretext was very simple—I was just an employee\nwho belonged. Armed with a trade publication I found in the trash, I followed a\nfew employees through the door and past the security guard. As we approached\nthe security guard I began a very simple conversation with one of the employees\nabout an article in the journal. All of my actions contributed to theme development.\nYour goal is to give the people who would normally stop you justifi cation for not\ndoing their job.\nTh e more you fi t in, the less you stand out, and the easier it is for security guards\nand the like to justify not stopping you and letting you in.\nHandling Denials and Overcoming Objections\nWhether on the phone or in person, what is the plan of action if you are denied\naccess to the place or information you are seeking? I like to call these conversation\nstoppers. People use them with salespeople all the time, “I’m not interested.” “I don’t\nhave time right now.” “I was just leaving….”\nWhatever fl avor of stopper targets throw out, you must have a plan to overcome\nit and handle the denial of access. I like to preemptively dismiss objections if I feel\nthe situation warrants.\nWhen I was in sales, I worked with a man named Tony who had a tactic that\ninvolved knocking on a door and introducing himself, and without pausing saying,\n“I know you might want to say you are not interested, but before you do, can you\nanswer this one question: Is fi ve minutes of your time worth $500?”\n148 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nAt this point, the person was much less likely say, “I’m not interested.” By dimin-\nishing the possibility of denial and following up with a question, Tony was able to\nget the target to think about something else besides her objection.\nIn a social engineering engagement you can’t walk up to the security guard and\nsay, “I know you don’t want to let strange people in the door but…” because it would\nraise way too much suspicion. Using this methodology to overcome objections is\nmuch more complex for social engineers.\nYou have to think about what objections might arise and organize your theme,\nstory, dress, and person to pre-empt those objections. Yet you still have to have a\ngood answer to give for when objections come up. You can’t just run out the door\nor hang up the phone. A good exit strategy enables you to come back to attack\nlater on.\nAn exit strategy can be as simple as, “Well, ma’am, I’m sorry you won’t let me in\nto see Mr. Smith. I know he will be greatly disappointed because he was expecting\nme, but I will give him a call later and set up another appointment.”\nKeeping the Target’s Attention\nIf you handled your social engineering move correctly up to this point and you are\nin front of the target, then the target may start to think about what would happen if\nshe does not allow access, take the fi le, or do what you are asking. You need to feed\noff of that inherent fear and use it to continue to move the target to your goal.\nA few short statements like, “Th ank you for your help. I was so nervous about\nthis interview that I obviously put the wrong date down in the calendar. I hope that\nMrs. HR Manager is some place warmer than here?” Allow for a response then\ncontinue, “I want to thank you for your help. When will she be back so I can call to\nmake another appointment?”\nPresenting an Alternate Route\nWhen you are interrogating the target in a social engineering audit, the possibility\nexists that your fi rst path will not be greeted with smiles, so having a lesser but just\nas eff ective path of action ready is a good idea.\nMaybe you have used all these tactics to try to get Sally, the receptionist, to let\nyou in to see Mr. Smith. Th e tactics are all failing and you are being shut down. You\nshould have an alternative path prepared, such as, “Sally, I appreciate you have to\nmake sure things are done by appointment only. I am just not sure when I will be\nback through the area. Can I leave you with this CD of information for Mr. Smith\nand then I can follow up with a phone call tomorrow to see whether he will set up\nan appointment?”\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 149\nHaving a few CDs prepared with some maliciously encoded PDFs can help to\nmake this path a reality, as well as having practiced and then using interrogation\ntactics quickly.\nA contact I have sent me a document, entitled “Interview and Interrogation,” that\nis used by the Department of Defense to train its staff in passing the polygraph.\nIt outlines the diff erent approaches that professional interrogators use, and I have\nprovided them here. Looking at these diff erent approaches one can learn a lot about\ndiff erent methods that might make sense for a social engineer.\n» Direct approach: Th e interrogator assumes an air of confi dence in this\napproach. Th e attitude and manner of the interrogator rules out that the\nsuspect is innocent at all. Without threatening, the interrogator disarms\nthe suspect by telling him anyone else would have done the same thing.\nAs a social engineer, you can utilize this approach depending on\nyour pretext. Maybe you are management, a consultant, or another per-\nson who has power over the target. This means you must have an air of\nconfidence and assume that the target “owes” you the response you seek.\n» Indirect approach: Th e suspect is allowed to tell his side of the story in\ndetail and the interrogator looks for omissions, discrepancies, and dis-\ntortions. Th e interrogator’s job is to let the suspect know that the best\ncourse of action is to tell the truth.\nAs a social engineer you can use this approach by not approaching\nthe target in any role, but maybe as an elicitation, a question designed to\nelicit information from the target. The social engineer can gather infor-\nmation from the target by letting him do most of the talking.\n» Sympathetic approach: Th e DOD manual off ers some excellent\nthoughts on this approach. Th e interrogator drops his voice and talks in\na lower, quieter tone that gives the impression he is an understanding\nperson. He sits close to the suspect and maybe puts his hand on the sus-\npect’s shoulder or pats him on the arm. Physical contact at the right time\nis very eff ective.\nThe social engineer can use this approach in the very same manner\nas the interrogator. Maybe you overhear some employees complain-\ning about the boss as you are waiting to tailgate in the door. Or maybe\nyou have followed the target to the local bar and get into a conversation\nwhere you can show empathy to a situation. You can use this approach\nall around, and it is very effective.\n150 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Emotional approach: Th is approach plays on the morals or emotions of\nthe suspect. Questions such as, “What will your wife or kids think about\nthis?” are used in this interrogation tactic. Th e thoughts that are aroused\nemotionally upset him and make him nervous; as these emotions mani-\nfest themselves, the interrogator can capitalize on them.\nYou can use this approach in a similar manner to the preceding, in\nwhich you play on a weakness identified in the target. In one engage-\nment, I knew the target was partial to charities for children who suf-\nfer from cancer. Playing on those emotions I was able to get the target\nto take an action he should not have taken, and it compromised his\noperation.\n» Logical approach: Th is non-emotional approach presents strong evi-\ndence of guilt. Th e interrogator should sit erectly and be business-like,\ndisplaying confi dence.\nYou can use this matter-of-fact approach when presenting evidence\nof your legitimate reasons for being present—for example, such as being\ndressed and armed as an IT repairman and having the air of confidence\nthat you belong there.\n» Aggressive approach: For an interrogator, a fi ne line exists between\ngathering information and infringing on the target’s rights that must not\nbe crossed. Th e voice should be raised, and the look and act should be\naggressive, but the suspect’s civil rights should never be violated.\nThe social engineer auditor needs to keep this fine line in mind. As\nin the case of Hewlett-Packard, discussed in Chapter 4, being hired to\nsocial engineer a company does not give you the right to break civil laws.\nMost of the time the company hiring you has no right to allow you to tap\nhome phones, read personal e-mails, or invade people’s privacy.\n» Combination approach: One interrogator may combine two\napproaches to have maximum eff ect. Th is would be decided upon based\non the suspect’s personality.\nAs a social engineer you may use the same technique—combine\nyour attacks and approaches for maximum effect. For instance, after you\ndiscover some personal details about a target—such as their favorite local\nbar—you can approach the target and start a conversation. Such a tactic,\nespecially when employed in a relaxed atmosphere, can go a long way\ntoward opening people up.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 151\n» Indiff erent approach: Th is approach is very interesting because the\ninterrogator acts as if he does not need the confession because the case is\nsolved. At that point the interrogator may try manipulating the suspect\ninto giving his side of the story.\nAs a social engineer you may not be able to use this approach unless\ncaught. If you’re caught in an area or situation you should not be in, you\ncan act indifferent instead of afraid that you are caught. Acting indif-\nferent can cause the person who caught you to not be alarmed as much\nand afford you an opportunity to dispel any worries. Kevin Mitnick (see\nChapter 8 for more on Mitnick) was great at this technique. He had the\nability to think quickly on his feet. Also, acting indifferent when he was in\na precarious situation allowed him to get away with a lot.\n» Face-saving approach: Th e interrogator should rationalize the off ense,\ngiving the suspect a way out and an excuse to confess and save face. An\ninterrogator should not make the excuse so good, however, that the sus-\npect can use it in court as a defense.\nA social engineer can really utilize this approach. An interrogator\ndoes not want to give someone too good an excuse, but a social engineer\ndoes. You want the excuse to be so good the target doesn’t even need to\nthink before rationalizing it as an excuse for complying with you.\nOne approach is to say a higher-level person asked you to be there.\nYou can follow this up by saying, “I can understand how you might feel\nnow, but I don’t even want to imagine how upset Mr. Smith will be if I\ndon’t fix that massive e-mail blunder before he returns on Monday.” This\napproach gives the target the ability to save face and comply.\n» Egotistical approach: Th is approach is all about pride. For it to work you\nneed a suspect who is very proud of an accomplishment. Bragging on good\nlooks, intelligence, or the way the crime was performed may stroke his ego\nenough that he wants to confess to show that, indeed, he was that smart.\nIn social engineering gigs this method is often used. Playing up\nsomeone’s accomplishments gets them to spill their deepest secrets. In\nthe case of the U.S. nuclear engineer in China (refer to Chapter 3), social\nengineers loaded the man with compliments, and he spilled the beans\nand divulged information he shouldn’t have.\n» Exaggeration approach: If an interrogator overexaggerates the case\nfacts, the suspect may admit to what was real. One example would be\n152 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nif an interrogator accuses a thief of wanting to commit rape and saying,\n“Why else would someone break into a bedroom in the middle of the\nnight?” Th is often causes the suspect to admit to only wanting to steal\nand not commit rape.\nYou can also use this approach by overexaggerating the task you are\nthere to perform. By overexaggerating the reason for being there you can\ngive the target a reason for providing you lesser access. For example, you\ncan say, “I know Mr. Smith wanted me to fix his computer personally\nbecause he lost a lot of data, but if you don’t feel comfortable with that, I\ncan potentially fix his problem from another computer in the office.”\n» Wedging the alibi: A suspect seldom confesses his transgressions all\nat once. Getting him to make minor admissions, such as he was on the\nsite, owned the weapon in question, or owned a similar car, can move\nhim toward admitting more and more, eventually leading to a complete\nconfession.\nMaybe you get stopped at the door during a social engineering gig\nand the gatekeeper refuses you access to the building. See whether you\ncan “gain access” by using a line like this: “I understand Mr. Smith is busy\nand can’t meet with me. Would you mind giving him this CD of informa-\ntion about our products and I will follow up with a phone call later on\ntoday or tomorrow?”\nIt is a lesser admission, but nevertheless would get if not you, then\none of your tools in the door.\nThe End Goal\nTo prepare to use proper interview or interrogation tactics, as a social engineer you\nmay want to answer a few questions of your own. I encourage you to write these\ndown in a notepad because doing so can help you prepare for your encounter with\nthe target. Plus, writing down your answers makes them real and gives you a path\nto work on during the preparation for your interrogation.\nAnswer these questions:\n» Who: With whom is the interrogation or encounter being conducted?\nWhat role does he play? List names, titles, and other information about\nhim that is relevant to the interrogation.\n» What: Exactly what preparation has been done and what is going to be\nyour goal during the interrogation? You must have a defi nite aim.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 153\n» When: What is the timeframe of the interrogation? What time of day\nor night? What are the circumstances at the business that lead to this\ndecision about when to make your move? Is there a party you overheard\nabout? Is it a time when a large portion of the employees are on vacation?\nIs it during lunch time? Is it during the changing of the security staff ?\n» Where: What is the location of the interrogation? Are you going to be at\nthe target’s location? Are you tracking the person to his or her gym, local\nbar, or daycare? Where is the best place to try to obtain the information\nyou need from the target?\n» Why: People hear this question often enough from their kids, but it must\nbe asked. What is the purpose of this interrogation? To make the target\nadmit to the location of something? To make him give out information\nhe should not? For you to gain access to a room or a server?\n» How: What methods will you use in this interrogation? NLP? Embedded\ncommands? Human buff er overfl ow (discussed at the end of this chap-\nter)? Microexpressions?\nOf course, in a criminal interrogation the goal is confession to a crime. With\ninterrogation as a social engineer the goal is a confession of a diff erent sort. You\nwant people to feel comfortable giving you information, and using the interroga-\ntion tactics discussed earlier you can make that easier to do. In the end, your social\nengineering interrogations should be like smooth interviews. However, a social\nengineer can use some other techniques to help while using interview and inter-\nrogation tactics on a target.\nGesturing\nGestures have a wide variation due to the fact that they are very much culturally depen-\ndent. Unlike microexpressions, which are universal, gestures from the United States\ncan actually be insulting in other parts of the world, or have no meaning at all.\nHere is an exercise to help you better understand gesturing diff erences. If you\nwant you can write down your answers to refer to in a few minutes. Depending on\nwhat culture you’re from, the answers will be interesting to see.\nWrite down what you think this gesture means and whether it is rude in each\ncase:\n1. Holding your palm facing upward, point at someone with your index fi n-\nger and beckon to him.\n154 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n2. Make a “V” sign with your index and middle fi ngers.\n3. Sit with the soles of your feet showing.\n4. Make the “ok” symbol with your fi ngers.\n5. Wave a hand with your palm facing outward.\n6. Nod your head up and down.\nIf you wrote down your answers, compare them to some of the following inter-\nesting cultural diff erences:\n1. In the U.S. this gesture simply means “Come here,” but in the Middle\nor Far East, Portugal, Spain, Latin America, Japan, Indonesia, and Hong\nKong, beckoning someone this way is considered rude or insulting.\nBeckoning someone with the palms facing down and using all the fi ngers\nto beckon is more acceptable.\n2. In the U.S. this gesture is a “peace sign,” but in Europe it means “victory.”\nIf you put the palm toward your face it actually means, “Shove it.”\n3. In the U.S. this is a comfortable way of sitting and doesn’t denote any\nbad intent. Yet in other countries, such as Th ailand, Japan, and France,\nas well as countries of the Middle and Near East, showing the soles of\nthe feet demonstrates disrespect. Exposing the lowest and dirtiest part of\nyour body is insulting.\n4. In the U.S. this gesture means everything is okay. But in other parts of\nthe world it has much diff erent meaning. In Brazil and Germany it is\nan obscene gesture, in Japan it means “money,” and in France it means\n“worthless.”\n5. In the U.S. this is a greeting, a way to say hello or good-bye. In Europe it\ncan mean “no,” and in Nigeria it is a serious insult.\n6. In the U.S. nodding your head is a way of saying “yes.” Th e same is true\nfor many places, but in some areas, such as Bulgaria or Greece, it is a way\nof saying “no.”\nTh ese are just a few examples of gestures that can have varying meanings depending\non where you are or who you are talking to. Understanding the diff erent meanings of\ngestures is important because communication is often much more than what is said.\nTh is section is intended to show that, during an interaction with a target, not\nonly can these principles be observed but they can also be utilized to manipulate\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 155\nthe target into a path of least resistance. Understanding the culture of the targets\nyou approach will also keep you from performing a gesture that can have undesir-\nable results.\nAnchoring\nGestures can have some powerful eff ects when used properly. Some of these prin-\nciples come from the study of NLP but can have a lot of power when you’re trying\nto set your target’s mind on a path you control.\nOne such method is anchoring, which is a method of linking statements of a\nlike kind with a certain gesture. For example, if you are talking to a target and he\ndescribes something positive and good, you can repeat it back while gesturing with\nyour right hand only. If it is something bad you can gesture with your left hand only.\nAfter doing this gesture a few times you begin to “anchor” in your target’s mind\nthat right-handed gestures are linked to good things.\nSalespeople use this method to further solidify that “their product” or “their\nservice” is excellent and the competitor’s is not. Some politicians use this method to\nanchor positive thoughts or thoughts they want their audience to think of as positive\nwith certain gestures. Bill Clinton was a great example of someone who understood\nthis. To see this in action (albeit not former President Clinton) visit www.youtube\n.com/watch?v=c1v4n3LKDto&feature=player_embedded.\nMirroring\nAnother tactic when it comes to gestures is called mirroring, where you try to\nmatch your gestures to the personality of the target. Of course, this is not as easy\nas it sounds. But what can you discern about the target from just observation? Is\nshe timid? Is he loud and outgoing? If you approach a timid person with large, loud\ngestures you will surely scare her off and potentially ruin your chances of making\nyour social engineering attempt. By the same token, if you are more timid you will\nneed to mirror “louder” gestures when dealing with “louder” people. Mirroring not\nonly involves mimicking a target’s body language but also using gestures that make\nit easy for a person to listen to you.\nYou can take this principle to another level. Seeing gestures a target is familiar\nwith can be comforting to him or her. However, you must strike a careful balance,\nbecause if your target has a particular gesture he seems to be using a lot and you\nuse it exactly the same way, then you run the risk of irritating him. You want to\nmirror him, but not exactly. If the target ends a thought by placing his hand on his\n156 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nchin you can end a thought by placing your hand on another part of your face or\nraise a fi nger to tap your chin a couple times.\nTh e following section analyzes the topic of gesturing a bit further by discussing\nthe importance of the position and placement of a target’s arms and hands.\nArm and Hand Placement\nLaw enforcement offi cers are trained to notice the placement and position of the\narms and hands during both interviews and interrogations. An increase in move-\nment or “fi dgeting” during an interrogation can show an increase in stress levels,\nsignifying that the interrogation is having the desired eff ect. Th is is, of course, in a\nlaw enforcement setting; in a social engineering setting you would watch for these\nsame signs, but signs of stress in the target might indicate you need to back off\n(unless your goal is to stress him or her out).\nCertain law enforcement offi cers are taught to pay attention to a couple of signs:\n» Elbows generally hang free next to the body when a person is relaxed.\nWhen you feel threatened or scared your body’s natural reaction is to\npull the elbows in towards the rib cage. In essence this position serves as\na layer of protection to one’s internal organs that might be threatened.\n» Hand gestures often can be very revealing, too. A target may describe\nsomething with his hands that he doesn’t say. For example, in a crime\ninterrogation suspects may make a gesture that describes the activity\n(that is, strangling, shooting, stabbing, and so on) but just say the word\ncrime or incident. Watching for the subtle hand gestures your target may\nuse is important.\nTaking note of signs that the target is feeling threatened or scared can help you\nto adjust and put them back at ease. When you approach a target, much can be\nsaid with body language and arm and hand gestures before the fi rst word is even\nspoken.\nOther gestures to take notice of include:\n» An open palm might indicate sincerity.\n» Steepled fi ngers could indicate the person feels authoritative.\n» Tapping or drumming fi ngers can indicate anxiety.\n» Touching the face can indicate thought; touching hair can indicate inse-\ncurity; and touching ears can indicate indecisiveness.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 157\nTaking note of these gestures in your target can tell you a lot about his mindset.\nOn the other hand, performing these gestures can help you to portray one of these\nimages if this is your pretext.\nFrom a social engineering standpoint here are a few key points about gestures,\nwhich can be imperative if you are a “big” gesturer like me:\n» No one should remember the gesture, but only the message attached to\nit. If people tend to say, “Wow, that guy gestures a lot” you need to calm\ndown a bit. Th e message is important, not the gesture.\n» Avoid monotony. Even in gestures you can be so bland, boring, and\nrepetitive that the gesture can adjust the target’s perception of you to be\nnegative.\n» Be very concerned about exhibiting anxiety, such as tapping or drum-\nming your fi ngers or making jerky movements. Th ey tell the target you\nare nervous and detract from your message.\n» Too much is too bad. Overgesturing can also detract from your message.\nRemember that using facial expressions, gestures, and posture is a package deal.\nTh ey must all blend together, be balanced, and support your pretext.\nAs good as all this information is, one tool in the interrogation arsenal can make\nor break the way you use this knowledge in your social engineering skills.\nListening Your Way to Success\nProbably not one skill exists that can be as encompassing as listening. Listening is a\nmajor part of being a social engineer. What you have to realize is a major diff erence\nexists between hearing and listening.\nIt is commonly believed that people retain much less than 50% of what they hear.\nTh at means if you are talking to a person for ten minutes he will remember only a\nfew minutes of what you said. Although people eke through life this way, it is not\nacceptable for a social engineer.\nOften the little things that are said can make or break how successful you are in\na social engineering endeavor. Th is area is where massively improving your listen-\ning skills comes in, and not just listening to what is said, but how it is said, when it\nis said, and with what emotion. All of these factors contribute to your perception\nof the information relayed.\nBeing a good listener might sound easy, but when you are in the heat of the\nmoment, your end goal is to gain access to the server room, and you are listening\n158 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nto a story by a few employees out for a smoke break who you plan on following into\nthe building, truly listening can be hard.\nYet it is during these times you might want to really listen. Maybe Susan starts\nto complain about her manager in HR, Mr. Jones. She tells a story about how short\nhe has been with her lately and how she is fed up with it. Th en her fellow smoker,\nBeth, says, “Well you should come over to the paradise of accounting. It is fi lled\nwith jerks there, too.”\nMaybe this just sounds like the complaining chatter of two tired and ticked-off\nemployees. Or is it more? You have both of their names, the name of a manager, the\nnames of their departments, and some idea of the general demeanor of some of the\nemployees. Th is information can be very valuable later on if you need to provide\nproof of your validity for being inside the building.\nOften the way someone says something can tell you a lot about the person, but\napplying this will require a lot of listening. Is the person angry, sad, or happy? Did\nshe speed up or slow down in her delivery? Did he get emotional or did his emotion\ntrail off ? Paying attention to these types of things can tell you a lot more than the\nwords at times.\nSo how can you become a great listener?\nTh e following steps can help you perfect your listening skills. Th ese tips can\nassist you not only in social engineering but also in life, and when applied to a social\nengineering audit can make a world of diff erence.\n1. Pay attention. Give your target your undue attention. Do not fi ddle with\nyour phone or other gadget. Do not drum or tap your fi ngers. Try to\nfocus intently on what is being said, looking at the person speaking. Do\nthis in a very inquisitive way, not in a scary, “I want to stalk you” way.\nTry hard not to think ahead and plan your next response. If you are\nplanning your next response or rebuttal you will not be focused, and you\nmay miss something important or give the target the impression you\ndon’t really care. This can be very hard to control, so perfecting this ten-\ndency will take some serious work for most people.\nAlso try to not be distracted by environmental factors. Noise in the\nbackground or a small group laughing about something can shift your\nfocus; do not allow that to happen.\nFinally, pay close attention to what the speaker is not saying, too.\nThe body language, facial cues, and other aspects of communication\nshould be “listened” to intently.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 159\n2. Provide proof that you are listening. Be open and inviting with your\nbody language and facial expressions. Nod once in a while, not too often,\nbut often enough to let the target know you are there. You don’t want to\nlook like a bobble head doll, but you want to let the target know you are\n“with him.”\nDon’t forget the all-important smile. Smiling can tell the target you\nare with him mentally and you understand what he’s saying. As with pay-\ning attention mentioned earlier, add small smiles when appropriate. If\nthe person is telling you her dog just died, nodding and smiling will most\nlikely get you nowhere.\n3. Provide valuable feedback. Letting your personal beliefs and experi-\nences fi lter the message coming your way is all too common. If you do\nthat you may not truly “hear” what the speaker is saying.\nBe sure to ask relevant questions. If she is telling you about the blue\nsky then you say, “So how blue was the sky?” will not be effective. Your\nquestions must show you have been actively listening and have the desire\nto gain a deeper understanding.\nEvery now and then mirroring or summarizing what you have heard\ncan work well, too. Don’t recite the conversation like a book report, but\nrecapping some of the main thoughts can help the target see you are in\ntune with the message.\n4. Do not interrupt. Not much more needs to be said on this tip.\nInterrupting your target shows a lack of concern for his feelings and\nstops the fl ow of thoughts. Letting him fi nish and then speaking is better.\nHowever, circumstances do exist where interrupting can be useful or\neven a tactic. If you want to see an example, watch the movie Sneakers.\nWhen Robert Redford is trying to gain access to a locked door that he\nmust be buzzed into, he interrupts the doorman in a heated dispute over\nsome delivery items. He does so a few times, eventually frustrating the\ndoorman and causing him to unlock the door with no authorization. If\nyou think it will get you somewhere, interrupting might be a good idea.\nMost of the time however, it is not.\n5. Respond appropriately. Th is is the pinnacle of good or bad listening\nskills. If you were focused on your rebuttal or next statement, or you\nwere thinking about the very attractive blonde that just walked by, you\nmight put your foot in your mouth.\n160 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nI was once training a group of people and was telling them some aspects of very\ndetailed manipulation tactics. I could tell two guys were not listening. I put in a\nrandom thought like, “So then you bake the lion at 350 degrees for 15 minutes til\ncrispy.” Th e rest of the group broke out in laughter and I turned to one of the two\nand said, “What do you think, John?” He responded with a blank stare and a stut-\ntered, “Um, yah, sounds perfect.”\nDo not ever do that to a target. It is a death blow to rapport (discussed later in\nthis chapter). Be respectful, keep your emotions in check, and respond appropriately\nat all times when conversing with a target.\nPaying attention, providing proof, giving positive feedback, being careful to never\ninterrupt, and responding appropriately can make or break you when it comes to listen-\ning. Th ey especially come into play during extended social engineering engagements,\nsuch as when I had to interact with the gentlemen at the Chamber of Commerce social\ngathering by “meeting” him at the bar and then talking to him about his business.\nMuch of the information I was seeking would have been divulged in normal, mundane\nconversation. Make sure you practice these tips at home or the offi ce before the time\ncomes for the conversation to take place. You want good listening to become second\nnature as part of your arsenal of talents, not something you have to think about.\nYour own emotions are another aspect of listening you must take into account. For\nexample, I was raised in a strict, religious Italian family. I was taught that you didn’t dis-\nrespect women, and I shudder to tell you of the one time I called my mom a disparaging\nname. I will tell you that it did not end too well for me. One day many years after that\nincident, I was working an engagement and was talking with a guy from whom I was\ntrying to obtain some information. I approached him in a social setting and we started\na conversation. He started to talk about a woman he worked with, in a very inappropri-\nate way. Being raised the way I was, I found a lot of anger boiling up inside me. I had a\nhard time containing those feelings and it must have shown on my face and in my body\nlanguage, leading to that particular vector being blown. In that failure I learned a very\nvaluable lesson—when it comes to listening during social engineering engagements,\nyou must try your hardest to not let the built-in fi lters you have get in the way.\nAlso, remember to react to the message, not the person. If you don’t agree with a\nperson’s beliefs or stance, aff ording him or her dignity will go a long way in making\nthat person feel comfortable with you. Even in situations where you might not agree\nyou can fi nd something empathic to say. For example:\nTarget: “Th is job stinks. Th ey make me work this horrible shift and for low\npay, too.”\nSE: “It sounds to me like you are overwhelmed by your situation here.”\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 161\nAlthough you might be thinking “Try Harder,”™ by responding this way you let\nthe target know you were listening, as well as empathizing with her plight in life.\nTh is technique is known as refl ective responding. Refl ective responding has some\nbasic principles to it:\n» Listen actively, as described earlier.\n» When it’s time to respond, be aware of your emotions. Knowing what\nyou feel as the target is speaking can help you to react properly.\n» Repeat the content, not like a parrot, but in your words.\n» Start your response with a non-committal phrase such as, “It sounds\nlike,” “It seems like,” or “It appears that.” Th ese phrases ease the message\nyou are trying to deliver. If you need proof of this, the next time you get\ninto an argument with your mate, boss, parents, or whomever say, “You\nare mad at me because…” and compare the person’s reaction with what\nyou get when you say “It appears you are mad because of…” instead. You\nwill see which one is taken better.\nRefl ective responding used with active listening is a very deadly force in the trust\nand rapport-building skills arena.\nAs you learn to listen better and it becomes part of your nature you will enhance\nyour ability to react to the message you hear. A social engineer’s goal is to gather\ninformation, gain access to someplace or something you should not have access to,\nor cause the target to take an action he should not take. Th inking that you must\nbe perfect at manipulation often stops people from learning and practicing great\nlistening skills, but this is the exact reason you need to be a great listener.\nConsider these two scenarios:\n» One of your neighbors comes over and asks whether you have time to\nhelp him with a project in his garage for about an hour. Th is neighbor\nhas a dog that has gotten into your garbage a few times and tends to like\nto use your yard as a bathroom. You are just about to sit down to relax at\nthe end of a long day and watch some TV or read a book.\n» Your childhood friend comes over and tells you that he needs some help\nmoving some furniture. He just got a place about fi ve miles from you\nand he can’t get the couch up the stairs. You are just about to sit down to\nrelax a bit.\n162 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFor which scenario are you more likely to put aside relaxing? Most people will\nput aside relaxing for the second scenario, but will come up with an excuse or rea-\nson to not help out in the fi rst scenario or at least try to postpone it to another day\nwhen they are not “busy.”\nWhy? People are very open and free with friends. When you feel comfortable\nwith someone, you have no boundaries and will put aside your own wants and needs\nat times to help them out. One naturally trusts the message coming from a friend,\nwhereas with the stranger one might start to double-guess what’s being said, trying\nto determine whether it is truthful or not. In the case of the relationship with the\nfriend, this connection is called rapport.\nFor years rapport has only been talked about when it comes to salespeople,\nnegotiators, and the like. Rapport isn’t just for salespeople; it is a tool that anyone\ncan use, especially the social engineer. If you are wondering how to build rapport\ninstantly, then read on.\nBuilding Instant Rapport\nMy former coworker, Tony, used to say that building rapport was more important\nthan breathing. I don’t really believe that to be true, but it does have a ring of truth\nin that rapport building is vital.\nWikipedia defi nes rapport as, “One of the most important features or charac-\nteristics of unconscious human interaction. It is commonality of perspective: being\n‘in sync’ with, or being ‘on the same wavelength’ as the person with whom you are\ntalking.”\nWhy is rapport discussed in this chapter? It is a key element in developing a\nrelationship with any person. Without rapport you are at an impasse. Within the\npsychological principles behind social engineering, rapport is one of the pillars.\nBefore getting into the aspects of how to use rapport as a social engineer you\nmust know how to build rapport. Building rapport is an important tool in a social\nengineer’s arsenal.\nImagine that you could make people you meet want to talk to you, want to tell\nyou their life story, and want to confi de in you. Have you ever met someone like that,\nsomeone you met recently but feel totally at ease telling him or her very personal\nthings? Many psychological reasons may play into why that may be the case, but\nthe case may be that you and that person just had good rapport.\nTh e following sections outline important points about building rapport and how\nto use rapport in social engineering.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 163\nBe Genuine about Wanting to Get to Know People\nHow important are people to you? Do you enjoy meeting new people? It is a mindset\nabout life, not something that can be taught. Th e prerequisite to building rapport\nis liking people. People can see through a fake interest.\nTo be a good social engineer and to be able to use rapport, people need to be impor-\ntant to you. You must like people and enjoy interacting with them. You have to want to\nlearn about people. People can see through fake smiles and fake interest. Developing\na genuine interest in your target can go a long way toward building rapport.\nTake Care with Your Appearance\nYou cannot change some things that may affect your interaction with others.\nUnfortunately, people can still hold your skin color, gender, or age against you before\nyou facilitate any interaction. You can’t control those things, but you can control\naspects of your appearance such as clothing, body odor, and cleanliness, as well as\nyour eye contact, body movements, and facial expressions. I read a statement once\nthat I have seen proven true too many times to ignore: “If a person is not comfort-\nable with himself, others will not be comfortable with him either.”\nBe aware of your pretext and your target. If your pretext is the janitor, make sure\nyour demeanor, dress, attitude, and words refl ect someone in that position. If your\npretext is a manager of a business, then make sure you act and dress appropriately.\nTh is takes research but nothing kills rapport easier than not looking the part. Your\ngoal in some instances is to keep people in the autopilot mode that will let them\nnot question you. Having your dress, grooming, or demeanor out of place removes\nthe target from autopilot and hurts your chances at success.\nBe a Good Listener\nSee the earlier section for more details. Th e importance of good listening can’t be\noverstated.\nWhether you are trying to make a friend or make a social engineering move,\nlistening is a skill you need to master.\nBe Aware of How You Affect People\nOne time I saw an older woman drop an item as she left a grocery store. I picked\nit up and followed her out to the parking lot. By the time I caught up with her she\n164 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nhad her trunk open and was loading groceries into her car. I came up behind this\nshort, little elderly woman and with all 6’ 3” of me looming over her said, “Excuse\nme, ma’am.” I was obviously too close for her comfort and when she turned around\nshe screamed out, “Help! He’s trying to mug me. Help!”\nI obviously needed to think about how my presence might aff ect this woman dur-\ning my interaction with her. I should have realized that an elderly woman all alone in\na parking lot who was not expecting a huge man to walk up behind her might freak\nout. I should have come around and approached her from a diff erent angle.\nBe aware of how your appearance and other personal aspects might aff ect those\nyou will be in contact with. Do you need a breath mint? Make sure no food is on\nyour face or in your teeth. Try to be relatively sure that nothing is glaring in your\npersonal appearance that will turn the person off .\nUCLA Professor of Psychology Albert Mehrabian is known for the 7-38-55 Rule,\nwhich states that statistics show that only 7% of normal communication is the words\nwe say, whereas much more lies in the body language and vocal tones. Try to be aware\nof yourself, but also pay attention to the fi rst few seconds of interaction with a per-\nson. His or her reaction to your approach can tell you whether you possibly missed\nsomething, or whether you need to change something to be more eff ective.\nAs a social engineer, be aware of how you aff ect people. If your end goal is all that\nis on your mind you will aff ect the people you come into contact with negatively.\nTh ink about how your appearance, words, and body language may aff ect your target.\nYou want to appear open and inviting.\nKeep the Conversation off Yourself\nWe all love to talk about ourselves and even more so if we feel we have a great story\nor account to share—it is human nature. Talking about yourself is one way to kill\nrapport. Let the other person talk about himself until he gets tired of it; you will be\ndeemed an “amazing friend,” a “perfect husband,” “great listener,” “perfect sales guy,”\nor whatever other title you are seeking. People feel good when they can talk about\nthemselves; I guess we are all a little narcissistic, but by letting the other person do\nthe talking you will leave that interaction with his liking you a lot more.\nKeep the conversation off yourself. Th is point is especially cogent for social engi-\nneers. You have a defi nite goal in mind and sometimes your judgment and direction\ncan be clouded by what “you” want. Taking that focus off of the target is dangerous\nas far as success goes. Let targets talk about their jobs, roles, and projects, and be\namazed at how much information they release.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 165\nRemember That Empathy Is Key to Rapport\nEmpathy—defi ned by Random House Dictionary as “the intellectual identifi cation\nwith or vicarious experiencing of the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes of another”—\nis lacking in many people today and is especially hard to feel if you think you have\nthe solution to someone’s problem. However, really listening to what someone is\nsaying, trying to identify and understand the underlying emotions, and then using\nrefl ection skills can make a person feel as if you are really in tune with him.\nI felt it necessary to provide the defi nition of empathy because understanding\nwhat it is you have to do is important. Notice that you must “intellectually identify”\nwith and then experience “the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes” of someone else.\nTh ese aren’t always serious, depressing, or extreme emotions. Even understanding\nwhy someone is irritated, tired, or not in the best mood can go a long way. Imagine\nyou go to the bank drive through and the teller lady gives you a monster attitude\nbecause you forgot to sign your check and she now has to send it back. You also\nforgot a pen and need to ask her for yet another favor. Your reaction might be similar\nto mine, especially if she gave you the eye roll and the irritated glance—you want to\ntell her that she is here to serve you. Instead, try saying this, “It appears you might\nbe a little irritated. I understand that; I get irritated when I have to deal with my\nforgetful clients, too. I hate to ask this, but could I please get a pen?”\nIt’s important to not be patronizing when attempting to show empathy. If your\nempathy seems to come off haughty or arrogant, you can make the target feel like\nyou are patronizing them.\nYou acknowledged her being upset but without accusation, showed that you have\nthe same feelings, and then made a request. Empathy can go a long way toward\nbuilding rapport; one caveat is that rapport cannot be faked. People need to feel\nyou are genuinely concerned to build that trust relationship. If you are not a natural\nat displaying empathy, then practice. Practice with your family, friends, coworkers,\nteachers, or classmates. However and wherever you do it, practicing being empa-\nthetic will greatly improve your relationship-building skills.\nEmpathy is a tool of the social engineer. Unfortunately, it is also used often in\nmalicious social engineering. When a catastrophe hits somewhere in the world\na malicious social engineer is often there to “empathize” with you. Th e thing that\nprobably makes this tool so easy for malicious social engineers to use in many cases\nis because they truly are from bad, poor, or impoverished places. Being in bad straits\nthemselves makes appearing empathetic to others’ plights in life easy and therefore\ncreates rapport automatically.\n166 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nNothing builds rapport more when people feel like you “get them.” Th is is proven\nvery true when someone is a victim of disaster. It’s a scary thought, but those who\nhave been victims of abuse, crime, rape, natural disasters, war, or other atrocities\non earth often can “understand” the feelings of those who are experiencing them.\nTh is opens victims up to trusting the wrong type of people if that rapport is built.\nAs mentioned before, when the 9/11 attacks happened in New York City, many\npeople claimed to have lost family or friends in terrorist attacks. Th at made people\nempathize and therefore these “victims” were given money, fame, or whatever they\nwere seeking.\nAs a social engineering auditor, you must be able to have a broad range of emo-\ntions that you can tap. Being closed in your emotions makes being empathetic very\nhard. Th is point goes along with really liking people. If you do, you won’t have a hard\ntime getting to know them and their stories and empathizing with them.\nBe Well Rounded in Your General Knowledge\nKnowledge is power. You don’t have to know everything about everything, but hav-\ning some knowledge about some things is a good idea. It makes you interesting and\ngives you something to base a conversation on.\nKnowledge is power. Th e old hacker mantra comes back to you as a social engi-\nneer. A social engineer should be a reader and a studier. If you fi ll your head with\nknowledge then you will have something to talk about when you approach a target.\nDon’t neglect reading, researching, and studying about the topic of the target’s\noccupation or hobbies. Your goal is not to be a “know-it-all” and become an expert\non every topic, but rather to have enough knowledge that you don’t look at the target\nwith a blank stare when she asks, “Did you bring an RJ-45 connector with you to fi x\nthe server’s network connection issues?”\nDevelop Your Curious Side\nPeople normally feel a little self-righteous when it comes to their beliefs or thoughts\non the way things should be done. Th at self-righteousness or judgmental attitude\ncan change the way a person reacts to something being said. Even if you don’t\nsay anything you may start to think it, which can show in your body language or\nfacial expressions. Instead of being self-righteous, develop a curiosity about how\nother people think and do things. Being curious keeps you from making rash judg-\nments. Th is can be applied by being humble enough to ask for help or ask for more\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 167\ninformation. Be open minded enough to look into and accept another’s thoughts\non a topic, even if those thoughts diff er from yours.\nCuriosity did not kill the social engineer. Th is point doesn’t change much from a\nnon–social engineer perspective. When you become curious about others’ lifestyles,\ncultures, and languages you begin to understand what makes people tick. Being\ncurious also keeps you from being rigid and unbending in your personal judgments.\nYou may not personally agree with certain topics, beliefs, or actions but if you can\nremain curious and nonjudgmental then you can approach a person by trying to\nunderstand why he is, acts, or portrays a certain way, instead of judging him.\nFind Ways to Meet People’s Needs\nTh is point is the pinnacle of the list and is one of the most powerful points in this\nbook. Dr. William Glasser wrote a book called Choice Th eory in which he identifi ed\nfour fundamental psychological needs for humans:\n» Belonging/connecting/love\n» Power/signifi cance/competence\n» Freedom/responsibility\n» Fun/learning\nTh e principle behind this point is that creating ways for people to get these needs\nmet by conversing with you builds instant rapport. If you can create an environment\nto provide those needs for people, you can create bonds that are unbreakable.\nLet me tell you a brief story about how powerful meeting people’s needs can be.\nI was in a minor car accident. A young driver pulled out in front of me and then\ndecided to stop. I had a split second to decide between hitting him going 55 mph\nor veering off away from him then launching my car over a small ditch into the side\nof a mountain. I chose in a second to not kill the three young people in the car. My\ncar went airborne until it was stopped by solid rock. I watched my beautiful little\ncustomized Jetta crumple under the weight, and my face smacked off the windshield.\nI barely nicked the other driver’s rear bumper but I was moving fast enough that\nhis car was sideways in the highway. When I was able to get my bearings we called\nthe cops and an ambulance.\nTh e young man had a diff erent insurance company than I did. Th e next morn-\ning I got a call from my agent, who politely asked me questions. He told me that\nan adjuster would come out to see my now-crumpled Jetta, and within 48 hours I\n168 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nwas handed a check and a letter stating they would cover all medical costs for my\nrecovery.\nI was then given a follow-up call from his insurance agent to see whether I was\nokay. How many calls from my insurance company do you think I got? I got one,\njust to tell me how to answer questions.\nI understand that caring about each person is not the job of these large compa-\nnies. But the other agent called me just see whether I was okay. I fought no battles\nto get paid and I was given a very fair price for my car.\nTwo days after that I cancelled my insurance and went to see Eric, the insurance\nagent who called me, from the young man’s company. I told him I was so impressed\nthat I wanted what he was selling. It has been 12 years now and I use Eric for every\ninsurance need I have. About two years ago I got a call from an insurance company\noff ering me rates that were substantially lower than what Eric and his company off er.\nI couldn’t even think about doing that to Eric. Why? Rapport—plain and simple.\nEric is my friend, my helper, someone I can call about questions on insurance, and\nsomeone who will always give me the best advice. He cares, he knows my family,\nand he never tries to hard-sell me. He doesn’t have to, because I will buy whatever\nhe has, because I trust him.\nTh is is the power of rapport. I don’t know, maybe Eric’s end game in check-\ning on me was to get me to move to his insurance practice, although I doubt it.\nKnowing him, he actually cares and anyone who knows him says the same thing.\nHis brother and he run a solid business. Rapport can create bonds between people\nthat transcend cost or loss.\nFilling a need for the person you are talking to drastically increases the chances of\nbuilding rapport. Do it without appearing to have an end game, do it with a genuine\ndesire to help, and be amazed at the results. Perhaps no other avenue is more valuable\nfor social engineers than being able to meet these needs. Learning how to create an\nenvironment that allows the target to feel comfortable and get one of the basic four\nfundamental needs met is a sure way to ensure unbreakable rapport.\nSpies use this principle of fi lling a need or desire often. In a recent trip to a South\nAmerican country I was told that its government is infi ltrated all the time via fulfi ll-\ning the basic need of “connecting or love.” A beautiful woman will be sent to seduce\na man, but this is no one-night stand. She will seduce him for days, weeks, months,\nor even years. As time continues she will get bolder with her requests for where\nthey are intimate, eventually making their way to his offi ce, where she gains access\nto plant bugs, Trojans, or clone drives. Th is method is devastating, but it works.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 169\nSocial engineers fi ll desires through phishing emails also. In one test 125 employ-\nees of a very reputable company were sent fake image fi les labeled BritneyNaked.jpg,\nMileyCyrusShowering.jpg, and other such names, and each image was encoded with\nmalicious code that would give the social engineer access on the user’s computer. Th e\nresults were that more than 75 percent of the images were clicked. What was found\nwas the younger the star mentioned in the picture, the higher the click ratio.\nTh ese disgusting and devastating facts show how well fulfi lling people’s desires\ncan work. In person, too, it is no diff erent. Police interrogators use this tactic for\nbuilding rapport all the time.\nOne time I interviewed a law enforcement agent for a podcast I did at social-\nengineer.org (www.social-engineer.org/framework/Podcast/001_-_\nInterrogation_and_Interview_Tactics). Th e guest told a story that proves this\npoint about the power of rapport to make people comply with requests. Th e offi cers\nhad arrested a man who was a peeping tom. He had a fetish where he loved to invade\nthe privacy of women who wore pink cowboy boots. Th e agent, instead of judging\nhim for the freak he is, used phrases like, “I like the red ones myself,” and “I saw this\ngirl the other day wearing short shorts and high cowboy boots, wow!”\nAfter just a short time he began to relax. Why? He was among like-minded\npeople. He felt connected, part of the crowd. Th eir comments put him at ease and\nhe began to spill his guts about his “habits.”\nTh e preceding is a nice example of how to develop and build rapport, but how\ncan you use it as a social engineer?\nYou can build rapport in a matter of seconds by applying the principles of building\nrapport discussed earlier. To prove this, imagine you need to grab some cash, you don’t\nhave your ATM card on you, and you forgot your account number, so you have to go\nin and ask someone for some help. Maybe you feel a little embarrassed about having\nto ask for your account number. You walk into a local branch of your bank you have\nnever been into. No one is in the bank and you have your choice of tellers. Maybe you\ndon’t think about it, most people don’t, but you will look over all the open lanes and\nchoose the person who makes you feel the most comfortable. You will get the same\nresults from each lane, but you will choose the one that makes you feel okay.\nMaybe you choose the most attractive person, or the one with the biggest smile,\nor the one who greets you fi rst—whomever you choose and however you choose\nthem you make the choice either consciously or unconsciously, but a lot of it has\nto do with rapport. Th e same principle will prove true when it comes to you and\nyour target. As you walk up to a target she will make instantaneous snap judgments\nof you based on your personal appearance, demeanor, facial expressions, and, of\n170 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ncourse, her mood. Most of these factors you can control, so take pre-emptive action\non them to ensure success.\nBuilding rapport properly creates a bond like strong glue that can withstand\nminor inconvenience and even some misunderstanding.\nRapport allows a person to say and do things that only close friends can do,\nbecause he or she is brought into that inner circle of trust. It is a powerful force\nwithout which salespeople, friendships, employment, and many other situations\nare much more diffi cult.\nRemember Chapter 4 on pretexting? You learned that pretexting is more than\njust playing a part, it is living, being, and becoming the person you are portraying\nto the target. Having a strong pretext is imperative to building the right kind of\nrapport. In many social engineering engagements you will not have the time to build\na storyline and use long-term seduction or rapport techniques, so your success will\nbe based on many of the non-verbal things you will need to do.\nUsing Other Rapport-Building Techniques\nOther rapport-building techniques exist that are based in NLP research. As you\nnow know, rapport is basically connecting with someone and putting him or her\nat ease; some NLP techniques used by hypnotists and NLP practitioners can put\npeople at ease instantly, as discussed next.\nBreathing at the Same Rate as Your Target\nBreathing at the same rate as someone doesn’t mean you closely listen to every\nbreath and try to breathe in and out when your target does. But some people have\nvery defi ned breathing patterns: Some have fast and short breathing, and some have\nlong and deep breathing. Notice how the target breathes and mirror that pattern,\nbut without parroting (that is, doing it at the same exact time).\nMatching Your Target’s Vocal Tone and Speech Pattern\nI was born in New York and raised in an Italian family. I talk fast, loud, and with\nmy hands. In addition to being 75 percent Italian, I am 25 percent Hungarian. I am\nbig, tall, and loud and gesture like a professional sign language translator on speed.\nIf I approach a timid, shy, slow-talking southerner I can kill rapport if I do not slow\ndown, put the hands away, and change my communication style. Listen to your\ntarget’s vocal tone and match yours to his, whether he is a slow, fast, loud, quiet, or\nsoft speaker. As for accents, a good rule is: Don’t try. Unless you can do it very well\ndon’t even attempt it. A poorly done accent is a rapport killer.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 171\nAlong these same lines, you can also try to listen for key phrases. People use\nterms like “okie dokie” or “yepper.” Listen for any key phrases, and even if they are\nout there, you might be able to work them into a sentence.\nOnce I was talking with a target who would say things like, “It’s six of one and half\ndozen of another.” I don’t use that phrase a lot and didn’t want to screw it up, because\nthat would create a lack of rapport. Instead, I would mix in some of the key words\nof that phrase and say things like, “I must have done that a half dozen times.”\nHow someone talks is also an area where you should restrict your personal judg-\nments. Some people are close talkers, some are whisperers, some are touchers—if\nyou are not, you need to allow a person freedom to talk the way he or she is com-\nfortable and then mirror it.\nMatching Your Target’s Body Language\nMatching body language is a very interesting avenue of rapport building mainly\nbecause it can work to create very strong bonds but at the same time it can kill all\nyour rapport in a matter of seconds in the case of a mismatch.\nIf you notice someone standing a certain way, maybe with both arms crossed,\ndon’t assume she is shutting you out—maybe she’s just cold. Can you cross one arm\nacross your body to mirror her stance, or fold your hands into a steeple?\nWhen sitting across from someone who is eating a meal you can take a few sips\nfrom your drink while he eats to mirror him. Don’t do everything he does, but\nmake similar actions.\nPeople like people who are like themselves. Th at is just human nature. It makes\nthem feel comfortable. Bill Philips was the genius behind the Body-for-Life program\nthat changed the way workout programs were developed. He promoted something\nthat was heavily tied to the mirroring principle. If you are fat and you only hang\nout with fat people, the chance of your changing is slim to none. Why? Th e answer\nis that you are comfortable with being fat and with people who are also comfort-\nable with it. If you want to change, then hang out with skinny people and a mental\nchange will quickly happen.\nTh is principle is the same in social engineering. You don’t want your targets to\nmake a change, so you need to be like them. You want them to feel good with you.\nTesting Rapport\nUsing these alternative rapport-building techniques as well as matching energy lev-\nels, facial expressions, and the like can build strong rapport on a subliminal level.\n172 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nAfter trying some of these tactics you can test your rapport by making a move-\nment, like scratching your head or rubbing your ear, and if in the next minute or\ntwo you see your target make a similar movement you probably have developed\nsome strong rapport.\nTh ese techniques can work wonders in many parts of your life when developing,\nbuilding, and starting relationships with others. Learning how to use the psycho-\nlogical principles included in this chapter can make a huge diff erence in your social\nengineering practice.\nFor years, there has been a myth that the human mind can be overwritten like\na program. Is it just a myth? Can the human mind be mastered?\nTh e next section reveals some of the most mind-blowing information in this\nbook.\nThe Human Buffer Overflow\nA glass can only hold so much liquid. If you have an 8-ounce glass and you try to\npour 10 ounces of liquid into it, what will happen? It will overfl ow and spill all over\nthe place. If you try to force the container to hold more liquid than it is meant to\nyou can eventually break the glass due to pressure.\nComputer programs work in a similar manner. Imagine you have a small program\nthat has only one purpose and two fi elds: User Name and Password.\nWhen the program opens you see a little screen where you type in admin in the\nUser Name fi eld and password in the Password fi eld. A little box appears that says\n“OK,” signifying all is good.\nTh e developer allocated a certain amount of memory space for the User Name\nfi eld, enough to hold the word admin a couple times. What happens if you put 20\nA’s in that fi eld and click OK?\nTh e program crashes and gives you an error message. Why? Th e input entered\nis longer than the allocated space and without proper error handling the program\nthrows an exception and crashes.\nTh e goal of software hackers is to fi nd the address that the program will call upon\nin a crash and insert malicious code into that address. By controlling the execution\nfl ow the hacker can tell the program to “execute” any program he desires. He can\ninject commands of any type into the memory space of that program because he\nnow controls it. As a penetration tester few things are more exciting than seeing a\nprogram execute commands you tell it to.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 173\nTh e human mind runs “software” and over the years you build instruction sets,\nbuff ers, and memory lengths into your “software package.”\nBefore applying this to the human mind, defi nitions of a few technical terms are\nnecessary. A buff er is an area of space that is given for something to happen or to\nhold data. As in the simplistic glass-of-water example, the password fi eld is given\na buff er, which is the number of characters that it is allowed to have. If a larger\nnumber than the buff er is entered the programmer needs to tell the program to do\nsomething with the larger than necessary data set.\nIf he doesn’t, the computer crashes and your program shuts down. Often what\nhappens in the background is the program didn’t know what to do with all the data\nso it overfl owed the allocated space, crashed the program, and exited. Hence the\nterm buff er overfl ow.\nTh e human mind works in a similar way. Space is allocated for certain datasets. If\na certain dataset does not fi t the space we have for it, what happens? Unlike a com-\nputer, your brain doesn’t crash, but it does open up a momentary gap that allows for\na command to be injected so the brain can be told what to do with the extra data.\nA human buff er overfl ow is basically the same principle. Th e goal is to identify\na running “program” and insert codes into that program that will allow you to\ninject commands and in essence control the movement of thought to a certain\ndirection.\nTo test this concept, take a look at a very simplistic example (see Figure 5-15).\nBecause the picture in this book is black and white, I have put a color copy up on the\nwebsite at www.social-engineer.org/resources/book/HumanBufferOverflow1.jpg.\nHere is the gist. Open that URL, and then as fast as you can try to read the color\nof the word, not what the word spells.\nFigure 5-15 Human buffer overflow experiment 1.\nTh is game is not as easy as it looks. If you successfully get through it, then try to do\nthe exercise faster and faster. What will happen to most, if not all, of us, is that at least\nonce you will read the word and not the color, or fi nd yourself struggling through it.\n174 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nWhy do we have such a hard time with this exercise? It is because of injected\ncommands. Our brains want to read the words not the colors. It is the way the\nhuman mind is wired. Our brain sees the color but it reacts to the word being spelled\nfi rst. Th erefore, the thought in our minds is the word not the color. Th is exercise\nshows that having “code” execute in the human brain that might be the opposite of\nwhat the person is thinking or seeing is possible.\nSetting the Ground Rules\nIn a paper entitled “Modifi cation of Audible and Visual Speech” (www.prometheus-inc\n.com/asi/multimedia1998/papers/covell.pdf) researchers Michele Covell,\nMalcolm Slaney, Cristoph Bregler, and Margaret Withgott state that scientists have\nproven that people speak 150 words per minute but think at 500–600 words per\nminute. Th is means that most people you talk to can jump around your conversa-\ntions in their heads. So overfl owing the brain through fast speech seems almost\nimpossible.\nYou must also understand how people make decisions in life. People make most\nof their decisions subconsciously, including how to drive to work, get coff ee, brush\ntheir teeth, and what clothes to wear without really thinking about it.\nHave you ever driven all the way to work and when you get there, you can’t\nremember what billboards you passed, what route you took or that traffi c accident\non the news? You were in a state of mind where your subconscious took over and\ndid what you always do without you consciously thinking about every turn.\nMost decisions people make are like this. Some scientists even believe people\nmake decisions up to seven seconds earlier in their subconscious before making\nthem in the real world. When people fi nally do make a decision consciously they\ndo it from more than just what they hear—sight, feelings, and emotions become\ninvolved in the decision.\nUnderstanding how humans work and think can be the quickest way to creating\na buff er overfl ow, or an overfl ow of the natural programs of the human mind so\nyou can inject commands.\nFuzzing the Human OS\nIn actual software hacking, a method called fuzzing is used to fi nd errors that can be\noverwritten and give control to a malicious hacker. Fuzzing is where the hacker throws\nrandom data at the program in diff ering lengths to see what makes it crash, because\nit cannot handle the data. Th at gives the hacker a path to inject malicious code.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 175\nJust like fuzzing a program, you must understand how the human mind reacts to\ncertain types of data. Presenting people with diff erent sets of decisions or diff erent\nsets of data, then seeing how they react can tell us the “programs” they are running.\nCertain laws in the human mind seem to be inherent that everyone follows.\nFor example, if you approach a building with two sets of doors (one outer and\none inner) and you hold the fi rst set open for a complete stranger, what do you think\nhe will do next? He will either hold the next set open for you or make sure that set\nstays open until you get inside.\nIf you are in a line of merging traffi c and you let a complete stranger merge in\nfront of you, most likely if you needed to merge later on he would let you in without\neven thinking. Why?\nTh e reason has to do with the law of expectations, which states that people usu-\nally comply with an expectation. Decisions are usually made based on what that\nperson feels the requestor expects him or her to do. One way you can start sending\nyour malicious “data” to the brain program is called presupposition.\nBy giving the target something fi rst, the request you make next will be “expected”\nto be followed. A simple example for you to test is with the doors. Hold a door for\nsomeone and most likely that person will at least make an attempt to ensure the\nnext set of doors is open for you. A social engineer can do this by fi rst giving the\ntarget a compliment or a piece of information they deem valuable, before the request\nis made. Giving that over fi rst creates in them the need to comply with a future\nrequest as it is expected.\nPresupposition can be described best via an example:\n“Did you know my next door neighbor, Ralph, always drives a green Ford\nEscort?”\nIn this sentence you presuppose:\n» I know my neighbor.\n» His name is Ralph.\n» He has a driver’s license.\n» He drives a green car.\nTo use presupposition eff ectively you ask a question using words, body language,\nand a facial expression that indicates what you are asking is already accepted. Th e\nbasic gist of this method is to bypass the “fi rewall” (the conscious mind) and gain\n176 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\naccess directly to the “root of the system” (the subconscious). Th e quickest way to\ninject your own “code” is through embedded commands, discussed next.\nThe Rules of Embedded Commands\nSome basic principles of embedded commands make them work:\n» Usually the commands are short: three to four words.\n» Slight emphasis is needed to make them eff ective.\n» Hiding them in normal sentences is the most eff ective use.\n» Your facial and body language must support the commands.\nEmbedded commands are popular in marketing with things like:\n» “Buy now!”\n» “Act now!”\n» “Follow me!”\nIn a real buff er overfl ow, exploit writers use padding, which is a method of adding\nsome characters that do not interrupt the execution but allow a nice little “landing\npad” that leads to the malicious code. Social engineers can utilize phrases that are\nlike padding, to help the next command have a soft place to land when it is injected,\nsuch as:\n» “When you…”\n» “How do you feel when you…”\n» “A person can…”\n» “As you…”\nAll of these statements create an emotion or a thought that allows you to inject\ncode into the subconscious.\nMany examples of embedded commands exist, but here are a few to ponder:\n» Using quotes or stories: Th e brain tends to process stories diff erently\nthan other information. Some of the greatest teachers who have ever\nlived—Aristotle, Plato, Gamaliel, Jesus—all used stories and illustrations\nto teach those listening to them. Why?\nThe unconscious mind processes stories as direct instructions.\nBandler, one of the fathers of NLP, taught that NLP practioners need to\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 177\nlearn to use quotes. He knew the power of stories or quotes would give\nthe speaker power over the thinking of his listeners. Reading quotes,\nusing quotes, and then embedding commands into quotes can be a pow-\nerful use of this technique.\nFor example, in one situation I needed to manipulate a target to give\nme an old password so I could “change” it to a more secure password. My\npretext was a support rep and they automatically questioned why there\nwas a need to change old passwords. I used something like, “A recent\nstudy by Xavier Research Inc. stated that 74% of the people use weak\npasswords in corporate America. That is the reason we launched a pro-\ngram to change the passwords corporate-wide. I will perform that pass-\nword change for you; I need for you to give me your old Windows\npassword and then I will make that change now.” By quoting a research\nfacility it added weight to my words about why this change had to occur.\n» Using negation: Negation is much like reverse psychology. By telling\nthe target to not do something too much, you can embed a command\ninto the sentence. For example, if I tell you “Don’t spend too much time\npracticing the use of embedded commands,” I can slip the command\n“practice the use of embedded commands” into my sentence. I also can\npresuppose that you will practice it to some extent, and if you are stub-\nborn you might say, “You can’t tell me what to do, I will practice all I\nwant.”\nTelling a person that something is not important or relevant makes\nhis unconscious pay extra attention so he can determine whether it is\nrelevant or not. You can embed commands in negative sentences like the\nearlier example that will leave the listener no option but to take action.\n» Forcing the listener to use his imagination: Th is method works when\nyou ask the listener a question, using phrases such as “What happens…”\nor “How do you feel when…,” for which he must imagine something\nto answer it. If you ask, “What happens when you become rich and\nfamous?” Th e listener has to internally imagine the time he might be\nrich and famous to answer that question. If I ask you, “What happens\nwhen you master the use of embedded commands?” I am forcing you\nto imagine becoming a master and how you will feel when that hap-\npens. Th ink of it this way: If I tell you, “Do not imagine a red cow,” you\nhave to picture a red cow fi rst to tell yourself to not think about it. Your\n178 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nunconscious mind is responsible for interpreting each word in a set of\ncommands into something it can represent and then give meaning to.\nBy the time your brain has understood the sentence, your uncon-\nscious has imagined it. The unconscious mind processes statements\ndirectly, with no regard to the context. The other great part is that the\nunconscious can track body language, facial expressions, voice tones, and\ngestures, and then connect each of them to the message being spoken.\nWhile it is connecting the dots, so to speak, the unconscious mind has\nlittle option but to comply if an embedded command exists.\nWhat’s important when using embedded commands is to not mess up your tones.\nIf you overemphasize the words then you will sound odd and scare the person off\ninstead of embed commands. As with a software buff er overfl ow, the information\nmust match the command you are trying to overfl ow.\nSummary\nAs you probably have already imagined, embedding commands is a vast fi eld with\na lot of room for error. You must practice to be very successful at it. Although I do\nnot promote using this information for seduction some decent videos exist about\nseduction that show how embedded commands can work.\nUsing these principles can create an environment where the target is very recep-\ntive to your suggestions.\nJust because you tell the person, “You will purchase from me” does not mean he\nalways will. So why use these commands?\nIt creates a platform to make social engineering easier. Using these types of com-\nmands is also a good lesson for companies you work with to educate them about\nwhat to look for and how to spot someone who may be trying to use this type of\nsocial engineering tactic against them.\nIf you were to write out this principle of embedded commands as an equation,\nyou could write it this way:\nHuman Buff er Overfl ow = Law of Expectations + Mental Padding + Embedded\nCodes.\nStart a conversation with a target using phrases, body language, and assumptive\nspeech. Presume the things you ask for are already as good as accomplished.\nMIND TRICKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES USED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING 179\nNext, pad the human mind with some statements that make embedding com-\nmands easier, while at the same time embedding the command. In essence this is\nthe equation for the human buff er overfl ow. Use this equation sparingly, but practice\na lot before you attempt it. Try it at work or home. Pick a target at work that might\nnot normally comply with simple requests and try to see whether you can get him\nto serve you coff ee: “Tom, I see you are heading to the kitchen, will you get me a\ncup of coff ee with two creams please?”\nEscalate your commands to larger tasks to see how far you can get. Try to use\nthis equation to get commitment from people. Eventually use this equation to see\nhow much information you can get and how many commands you can inject.\nTh is chapter covered some of the deepest and most amazing psychology prin-\nciples in social engineering. Th is chapter alone can change your life, as well as your\nability as a social engineer.

    "text": "Influence:\n6\nThe Power of\nPersuasion\nIf you would persuade, you must appeal to interest rather than\nintellect.\n—Benjamin Franklin\nT\nhe epigraph sums up this entire chapter. You might be wondering why I didn’t\ninclude this within Chapter 5’s discussion of psychological principles of social\nengineering. Psychology is a science and a set of rules exists in it that, if followed,\nwill yield a result. Social engineering psychology is scientific and calculated.\nInfl uence and persuasion are much like art that is backed up by science. Persuasion\nand infl uence involve emotions and beliefs. As discussed in some of the earlier chap-\nters, you have to know how and what people are thinking.\nInfl uence and the art of persuasion is the process of getting someone else to want\nto do, react, think, or believe in the way you want them to.\nIf you need to, reread the preceding sentence. It is probably one of the most power-\nful sentences in this whole book. It means that using the principles discussed herein,\nyou will be able to move someone to think, act, and maybe even believe the way you\nwant him to because he wants to. Social engineers use the art of persuasion every day\nand, unfortunately, malicious scammers and social engineers use it, too.\nSome people have devoted their life to researching, studying, and perfecting\nthe art of infl uence. Th ose such as Dr. Ellen Langer, Robert Cialdini, and Kevin\nHogan have contributed a very large repository of knowledge in this fi eld. Mix this\nknowledge with the research and teachings of NLP (neurolinguistic programming)\nmasters such as Bandler, Grinder, and more recently Jamie Smart, and what you\nhave is a recipe to become a true artist.\nTrue infl uence is elegant and smooth and most of the time undetectable to those\nbeing infl uenced. When you learn the methods you will start to notice them in com-\nmercials, on billboards, and when used by salespeople. You will start to get irritated\n182 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nat the shoddy attempts of marketing people and if you are like me, you will begin\nto rant and rave at terrible commercials and billboards while driving (which does\nnot make my wife very happy).\nBefore getting into how social engineers will use in infl uence and persuasion,\nthe chapter begins with a short tour of some of the key elements of persuasion\nand infl uence that I have compiled and used. Th is chapter will discuss things like\nreciprocation, manipulation, and the power of setting goals, just to name a few of\nthese key elements.\nInfl uence and persuasion can be broken down into fi ve important aspects, as\ndiscussed in the following sections.\nThe Five Fundamentals of Influence\nand Persuasion\nTh e fi ve fundamentals of persuasion are crucial in obtaining any type of successful\ninfl uence upon a target:\n» Setting clear goals\n» Building rapport\n» Being observant of your surroundings\n» Being fl exible\n» Getting in touch with yourself\nTh e whole goal of social engineering is to infl uence the target to take an action that\nmay or may not be in their best interest. Yet they will not only take the action, but want\nto take the action and maybe even thank you for it at the end. Th is type of infl uence is\npowerful and can make a social engineer who possesses these skills legendary.\nWorld-renowned NLP trainer Jamie Smart once said, “Th e map is not the territory.”\nI love that quote because it blends perfectly with these fi ve fundamentals. None of them\nare the whole sum on their own, but individually they are like points on a map that\nshow you the whole territory of what you want to accomplish. Th e following section\ndelves deep into the fi rst fundamental: why setting clear goals is very important.\nHave a Clear Goal in Mind\nNot only should you have a clear goal in mind, you should even go so far as to write\nit down. Ask yourself, “What do I want out of this engagement or interaction?”\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 183\nAs I discussed in Chapter 5, especially in relation to NLP, a human’s internal\nsystems are aff ected by his thoughts and goals. If you focus on something, you\nmay be more likely to become it or get it. Th is doesn’t mean that if you focus on the\nthought of getting one million dollars, you will get it. In fact, it is unlikely. However,\nif you had a goal of making one million dollars and focused on the steps needed to\nmake that money, your goals, education, and actions would increase the likelihood\nof you achieving that goal. Th e same is true with persuasion. What is your goal? Is\nit to change someone’s beliefs? To get him to take an action? Suppose a dear friend\nis doing something terribly unhealthy and you want to try and persuade her to\nstop. What is the goal? Maybe the end goal is to persuade her to stop, but maybe\nlittle goals exist along the way. Outlining all of these goals can make the path to\ninfl uencing that person clearer.\nAfter setting the goal, you must ask yourself, “How will I know when I have\ngotten it?” I once listened to a training program off ered by Jamie Smart, one of\nthe world leaders on NLP, and he asked each person in the classroom these two\nquestions:\n» What do you want?\n» How will you know when you have it?\nAt this point, I paused the CD for the fi rst question and answered for myself out\nloud what I wanted from this course. Th en I pressed Play again and when he asked\nthat second question, “How will you know you have gotten it?” I paused the CD again\nand was lost. It was clear to me that I didn’t have a roadmap. I knew what I wanted\nout of that course, but I didn’t know how to gauge when I had gotten it.\nKnowing what you want out of your engagements is an important aspect of\ninfl uence and persuasion tactics. When you approach a target knowing what your\ngoals are and what the indicators are that you are getting what you want, then you\ncan clearly identify the path you need to take. Clearly defi ned goals can make or\nbreak the success of the infl uence tactics used by a social engineer as well as make\nthe next step much easier to master.\nRapport, Rapport, Rapport\nChapter 5 has a whole section on rapport building. Read it, study it, and perfect\nyour rapport-building skills.\nDeveloping rapport means that you get the attention of the person you are target-\ning and his unconscious mind, and you build trust within that unconscious portion.\n184 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nMastering the skill of building rapport can change the way you deal with people,\nand when it comes to social engineering, it can change your whole methodology.\nTo build rapport, start where the person you want to infl uence is mentally—try\nto understand their frame of mind. Are they suspicious? Are they upset, sad, or\nworried? Whatever emotional state you perceive them to be in, start from there. Do\nnot focus on your goals as much as focusing on understanding the person. Th is is\na very vital point. Th is means a social engineer must understand his target enough\nthat they can imagine where they are consciously. What are the target’s thoughts\nand state of mind?\nFor example, imagine you want to infl uence your dear friend to want to quit\nsmoking or doing drugs or something else. Notice you don’t want to convince her\nto quit, but convince her to want to quit. Your goal cannot be about you, right? It\nmust focus on the target. You can’t start your conversation with what her addiction\nis doing to you and how much you hate the smell, and so on. Th e argument has to\nbe what is in it for her. You cannot start the conversation with a verbal attack about\nwhat the person has done to you with their habit, but you need to understand where\nthat person’s frame of mind is, accept it, and come into alignment with it.\nSocial engineering is much the same: you can’t start where you are mentally.\nTh is is going to be struggle for many people. Do you know why she smokes? Do\nyou understand the psychological, physical, or mental reasons why? Until you can\nreally get into her shoes, you cannot build a strong rapport and your eff orts at\ninfl uence will fail.\nIn addition, you cannot always base the idea of building rapport on logic. I once\nwas in the hospital with a dear friend who was dying from throat cancer. He had\nsmoked for more than 40 years and one day he found out he had cancer. It spread\nfast, bringing him to the hospital to live out his last days. His children would come\nto visit and every now and then they would leave the room. I thought they were\novercome with emotion. One time after they excused themselves I went out to\ncomfort them and they were outside the hospital smoking! I was dumbfounded. I\ndon’t smoke and have no desire to, and although I can understand how strong an\naddiction can be, I couldn’t understand how after seeing the pain their father was\nin, how they could raise a cigarette to their lips.\nLogic would not win in this case. Telling my friend’s children why smoking is bad\nand how it will kill them would do no good—this information was useless because it\nwas combative and only made me feel good in saying it, but did not align with their\npresent frame of mind. Until you understand the person you cannot successfully\nbuild a good enough rapport to infl uence him or her.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 185\nGetting someone to want to do something is a blend of emotion and logic, as\nwell as understanding and humility in many cases. Once I walked into an offi ce I\nwas going to do some work for and I had heard a funny comment outside, so when\nI walked in the main lobby I was chuckling. Th e woman behind the desk must have\njust done something embarrassing because when she saw me she immediately got\nangry and yelled at me, “It’s not very funny and you are a jerk.”\nNow I didn’t know this woman and to tell you the truth I had a goal in mind that\nthis interaction was not going to help. In addition, I felt insulted that she assumed\nI was laughing at her, and wanted to lash back at her. But instead, I saw she was\nupset. I got close to the counter so as not to embarrass her anymore, I looked her\nin the eye, and with sincerity said, “I am so sorry if you thought I was laughing at\nyou. I was in the parking lot and some of your workmates were telling a story about\na party over the weekend and I thought it was very funny.”\nShe looked at me and I could tell she was now even more embarrassed, so to\nsave face for her, I loudly said, “Ma’am, I am sorry for laughing and embarrassing\nyou.” Th is allowed her to save face to those around us. She understood that I “took\none for the team” and she responded with extreme kindness. A minute later she\napologized and it worked to my benefi t as I was given all the data I asked for, data I\nnormally would have had to work very hard to get.\nA teacher I had once used to tell me to “kill them with kindness.” Th at is a pretty\npowerful statement. Being kind to people is a quick way to build rapport and to\nestablish yourself in the fi ve fundamentals of persuasion and infl uence.\nOne method to infl uence people using kindness and rapport is to ask questions and\ngive choices that lead them to a path you want. For example, once I was infl uenced to\ntake a job I really didn’t want as part of a team eff ort. Th e team leader was very char-\nismatic and friendly and had the “charm factor” that allowed him to speak to anyone.\nHe approached me and said, “Chris, I wanted to talk to you separately from the team.\nI need a right hand for a small project. But the person needs to be a go-getter, self\nmotivated. I think this is you, but I don’t want to assume; what do you think?”\nI was excited and fl attered by the compliments and the potential to be “important,”\nso I responded, “I am a very self-motivated person. Whatever you need, tell me.”\nTh e team leader continued, “Well, I am a big believer in leading by example. And\nI think you have that leadership quality. Th e problem is, some on the team do not,\nand they need a strong person to show them how it is done.”\nBefore the end of the conversation, what he wanted appeared as if it was my idea,\nwhich made it impossible to back out of. Powerful indeed, and all started with the\npower of persuasion.\n186 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nBe in Tune with Yourself and Your Surroundings\nBeing aware of yourself and your surroundings, or sensory acuity, is the ability to\nnotice the signs in the person you are targeting and yourself that will tell you that\nyou are moving in the right direction or not.\nMany of the principles discussed in the previous chapter apply to persuasion.\nReading body language and facial signs can tell you much about your infl uence on\nthe person.\nTo really master the dual art of infl uence and persuasion, you have to become a\nmaster watcher and master listener. Chris Westbury, a cognitive neuropsycholo-\ngist at the University of Alberta, Canada, estimates that human brains process\ninformation at 20 million billion calculations per second. Th ose calculations are\nrepresented by facial expressions, microexpressions, gestures, posture, voice tones,\neye blinks, breathing rate, speech patterns, nonverbal utterances, and many more\ntypes of distinguishing patterns. Mastering infl uence means to be aware of those\nsubtle things in yourself and others.\nI found, for myself, the ability to be observant proved to be easier for me after\nreceiving some training from Dr. Ekman in microexpressions. I found afterward that\nnot only did I become much more aware of what was going on with those around me,\nbut also myself. When I felt a certain expression on my face, I was able to analyze\nit and see how it might be portrayed to others. Th is recognition of myself and my\nsurroundings was one of the most enlightening experiences of my life.\nNLP experts promote minimizing your internal dialog when trying to infl uence\nothers. If you approach the target thinking about the next stage of the attack, the\nend goal, or comebacks for potential conversation stoppers, that internal dialog can\ncause you to miss a lot of what is going on around you. Being observant takes a lot\nof work but the payoff is well worth it.\nDon’t Act Insane—Be Flexible\nWhat do I mean by not acting insane and being fl exible? One defi nition of insanity\nthat’s been fl oating around for years is “doing the same thing over and over and expect-\ning diff erent results.” Being willing and able to fl ex is one of the keys to persuasion.\nYou can think of this fl exibility in terms of physical things. If you were tasked to\npersuade or bend something, would you rather it be a branch from a willow tree or\na steel rod? Most people would say the willow branch because it is fl exible, easier\nto bend, and makes the task accomplishable. Trying to persuade others while being",

Other aspects might not fi t too easily, but hold a very powerful position\nin the world of infl uence. Th e following sections cover eight diff erent techniques of\n188 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ninfl uence that are used often by media, politicians, government, con men, scammers,\nand of course, social engineers.\nEach section provides an analysis of each technique to see how it is used in other\nareas of infl uence besides social engineering, as well as takes a closer look at how\nit can apply to a social engineer.\nReciprocation\nReciprocity is the inherent expectation that when others treat you well you respond\nin kind. A simple example is when you are walking into a building—if someone holds\na door open for you, he expects you to say thank you and then make sure that next\ndoor stays open for him as he comes in.\nTh e rule of reciprocity is important because often the returned favor is done\nunconsciously. Knowing this means that you now have a step up on how you can\nuse it as a social engineer. Before getting into that, though, here are a few examples\nwhere reciprocity is often used:\n» Pharmaceutical companies will spend $10,000–$15,000 per doctor (yes,\nper doctor) on “gifts” that might include dinners, books, computers, hats,\nclothing, or other items that have the drug company’s logo on it. When the\ntime comes to choose a drug to support and buy, to whom do you think\nthe doctors are more likely to go?\n» Politicians are infl uenced in much the same way. It is no secret that many\ntimes politicians or lobbyists are more favorable to people who helped\ntheir political campaign than those who did not.\n» Reciprocity is often used in business, especially when it comes to matters\nof contracts. Maybe the sales guy will pay for a meal, then later on ask for a\nconcession in the contract. Th e client is compelled to give this concession.\n» A fellow employee fi lled in for you one week when you needed a day off .\nNow she asks you to return the favor, but you have plans. In this situa-\ntion, people will reschedule and honor the request.\nAll of these are examples of reciprocity. Sociologist Alvin Gouldner wrote a\npaper called, “Th e Norm of Reciprocity” (http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/\ncourses/normrecp.html) in which he states:\nSpecifically, I suggest that a norm of reciprocity, in its universal\nform, makes two interrelated, minimal demands: (1) people should\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 189\nhelp those who have helped them, and (2) people should not injure\nthose who have helped them. Generically, the norm of reciproc-\nity may be conceived of as a dimension to be found in all value\nsystems and, in particular as one among a number of “Principal\nComponents” universally present in moral codes.\nBasically, his research led him to see that reciprocity works despite cultural\nbackgrounds. Reciprocity, used under the right circumstances, is all but impos-\nsible to resist.\nTh ink of reciprocity as the process shown in Figure 6-1.\nReciprocity\nRequest Give Something\nGranted Away\nMake Your Indebted\nRequest Feelings\nFigure 6-1 The cycle of reciprocity.\nTh e following sections expand on some key points of the preceding idea.\nGive Something Away\nTh e thing you give away can’t be some simple piece of junk. Th e thing given must\nhave value—to the recipient. Giving away a beautiful hardcover novel written in a\nlanguage the recipient does not read or collect is useless.\nTh e item can be a service, a physical item, some valuable information, assistance,\nor anything else that the receiver will deem as a value (even something as simple\nas holding the door or picking up something dropped). Some sales organizations\npromote this method but then fall short by off ering something that has no value.\nImagine you are at a trade show and at each table is a giveaway. If you walk up to a\ntable and notice a pile of cheap-looking pens you might just walk by. Th e next table\nhas an interesting puzzle-like game. You are intrigued so you pick it up; after you\n190 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nspend a few minutes playing with it a salesperson approaches and says, “You want\na hint?” After showing you a small hint he asks whether you have a minute so he\ncan show you a service you might really love.\nHow can you say no? You get an intriguing game and a free hint, and now all he\nwants is a minute of your time? It’s a perfect setup.\nCreate Indebted Feelings\nTh e more value the gift has to the recipient and the more unexpected it is, the\ngreater the sense of indebtedness.\nNot allowing the gift to be used in an obvious manipulation tactic is important.\nDon’t say or act like, “I gave you this great gift now you owe me.” Even thinking it\ncan take away any feelings of indebtedness. Th e “gift” should be totally free and of\ngreat value to the recipient.\nTh e Humane Society of the United States, for instance, gives away personalized\nmailing labels as a free gift. No strings are attached and many people use them for\nholiday cards or personal letters. Th ey are attractive and good quality. You sign up\nfor them, and many months later you will get a call asking for a donation to support\nyour local Humane Society. Th e recipient’s sense of obligation is usually too great\nto not contribute even a little.\nBy way of another example, Fortune Magazine off ers college professors free issues\nof its magazine to try out in their classes with no strings attached at all.\nMany examples of reciprocity like these exist. On the fl ip side, many companies\nfail at reciprocity by thinking things like the following are good gifts:\n» Sharp-looking and colorful corporate brochures\n» Useless and junky toys\n» Sales literature about your products or company\nTh ese things do not build indebtedness. Th e recipient must deem the “gift” valu-\nable. Another source of “gifts” that can build true indebtedness is information.\nGiving away a valuable, benefi cial, or useful piece of information can literally be of\nmore interest than a physical gift to some.\nAsk for What You Want\nOn one occasion as I was entering a building, I saw a man who looked very much\nto be the “boss” get out of his car parked in the spot marked “For CFO Only,” and\nhe was on his cell phone. He was not a happy guy, and I overheard him telling\nsomeone that he was upset because he had to go inside and let some people go. I\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 191\nassumed from his tone that he was on with his wife or girlfriend and he didn’t like\nthe job he was about to do.\nI walked past him and went to the front desk and as I walked up I saw that the\ngirl behind the desk was playing Minesweeper. As I approached the counter she gave\nme the standard, “How can I help you?” She had a look on her face that said she was\nbored and not in the mood. I said, “Look, I am here for a meeting, but your boss is\nabout to walk in and he is in a bad mood…” I then trailed off and just stood there\nwith a folder in my hand. A few seconds later the boss stormed in the front door and\nI said loudly, “Th ank you so much for your assistance.”\nShe looked over and said to me, “Excuse me, sir,” then said to her boss, “Good\nmorning, Mr. Smith, I have your messages,” and then handed him a small pile of\npaper as he walked by.\nWhen he disappeared to his offi ce she thanked me profusely. I just saved her and\nshe knew it. Th e information I gave her was invaluable, and my next words would\nbe imperative: “I need your help. I wanted to see the HR manager just for a brief\nmeeting. Can you get me into her offi ce real quick?”\nShe walked me back to the manager’s offi ce and introduced me as “her friend” that\nstopped in. Within minutes my plan was launched, and all thanks to reciprocity.\nAs a social engineer, look for little opportunities to give out information that\nwill make you valuable to the recipient and more importantly, make the recipient\nindebted to you.\nBe aware of your surroundings and what little things you can do to make your\ntargets indebted to you. Remember it doesn’t have to be something amazing, just\nsomething that they value. A good point to keep in mind is to not “stalk” the target.\nStanding and staring at him or her waiting for an opportunity to do or say something\ncan be off -putting. Th ese principles should be natural.\nNaturalness means you start doing these principles in everyday life. Hold doors\nfor people, be very polite, and look for opportunities to do good things for others.\nTh ese actions will become second nature and you will have fewer struggles doing\nthem in an audit.\nReciprocity is a powerful infl uence tactic, and the next two principles discussed\nare closely tied into it.\nObligation\nObligation has to do with actions one feels he needs to take due to some sort of\nsocial, legal, or moral requirement, duty, contract, or promise. In the context of\n192 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nsocial engineering, obligation is closely related to reciprocation but is not limited\nto it. Obligation can be as simple as holding an outer door for someone, which will\nusually make him hold the inner door for you. It can be escalated to someone giving\nyou private info because you create in them a sense of obligation to you. Obligation\nis a common attack vector used when targeting customer service people.\nYou can also use obligation in small doses by utilizing smart complimenting. For\nexample, compliment the person, then follow it up with a request. Th is technique is\nvery easy to do wrong if you are new or inexperienced and can come across so fake\nthat it alerts the target’s inner sense and has the wrong eff ect. But if done properly,\nit can lead to obtaining even little pieces of valuable information.\nAn example of complimenting in the wrong way would be something like, “Wow,\nyou have beautiful eyes, can I get into your server room?” Sounds stupid, huh? Be\nsure to say your method out loud to see how it sounds. If it sounds like a cheap\npickup line then it has to go.\nA small conversation like this, on the other hand, can be a proper way to\ncompliment:\nAs you approach the receptionist’s desk you see some pictures of a couple of\nlittle children at Disney World and after you introduce yourself you say, “Are those\nyour kids? Th ey sure are cute.” Regardless if they are the receptionist’s kids or her\nnephews, she will most likely enjoy your compliment. Th en you follow up with, “I\nhave a couple of my own. Th ey keep us young, huh?”\n“Yes, my two kids. And I am not sure about young,” she chuckles, “but they do\ntire me out.”\n“I haven’t taken mine to Disney yet,” I say. “Did you fi nd they enjoyed it at that\nage?”\n“Oh yeah, they loved every second of it,” says the receptionist. “As long as my\ndaughter is with her Daddy, she is having fun.”\n“Ah, yeah, I have my little princess too,” I reply. “Well, I could stand here and talk\nabout my kids all day, but I am wondering if you can help me out. I called in and\nspoke to someone last week about a new HR software package and I said I would\ndrop off this information packet, but I lost the paper I wrote her name on. I am\nterribly embarrassed.”\n“Oh, that’s probably Mrs. Smith,” off ers the receptionist. “She handles all of\nthat.”\n“You are a life saver. I owe you one. Th ank you.”\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 193\nTh ese types of compliments go a long way to opening the target up to be more\nagreeable to infl uence.\nTh e golden rule—treat others as you would wish to be treated—is a key principle\nin creating obligation. Treating people kindly and giving them something they may\nneed, even if it is as small as a compliment, can create a sense of obligation to you.\nPsychologist Steve Bressert makes this point in his article “Persuasion and How\nTo Infl uence Others,” in which he states, “according to the American Disabled\nVeterans organization, mailing out a simple appeal for donations produces an 18%\nsuccess rate. Enclosing a small gift, such as personalized address labels, nearly\ndoubles the success rate to 35%. ‘Since you sent me some useful address labels, I’ll\nsend you a small donation in return.’”\nIf you want to prove to yourself the power of this principle try this simple exer-\ncise. Even something as small as a question can create obligation. Th e next time\nsomeone asks you a question, say nothing. Just stay silent or ignore it and move on\nin the conversation. Notice how awkward that is; something as simple as a question\ncreates a sense of obligation to answer. Simply asking the target a question can lead\nto amazing results.\nIf your fi rst action creates a feeling that there is an expected follow-up, then ful-\nfi lling that expectation can lead to strong feelings of obligation. When the person\nwith whom you are interacting expects a result, fulfi lling it can create a strong sense\nof commitment in him or her to do the same for you.\nTh is method can be used, for example, by sending the CFO of a company a piece\nof technology, maybe an iPod loaded with malicious software. When he gets the gift\nhe is obligated to plug it in. One successful attack vector I saw in play was where the\nsocial engineer sent a small relevant gift to the CFO or CEO with a card that said,\n“Please accept a small gift from our company. All we ask is that you browse our prod-\nucts at www.products.com and download our PDF catalog here at www.products\n.com/catalog.pdf. I will call you next week.”\nTh is method was successful every time.\nConcession\nA concession, or the act of conceding, is defi ned as “an acknowledgment or admis-\nsion,” or “the act of yielding.” Concessions are used often within the social engineer-\ning context as a play on the reciprocation instinct of humans. Humans seem to have\na built-in function that makes them want to “do unto others as they do unto” you.\n194 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nA social engineer can use the “something for something” idea or the “I’ll scratch\nyour back if you scratch mine” principle.\nTh ere are basic principles to concessions and how to use them properly:\n» Label your concessions: Make it known when and what you are con-\nceding, which makes it diffi cult for your mark to ignore the urge to recip-\nrocate. Th is will take balance because you don’t want to blow a trumpet,\nso to speak, while you announce a concession, but a simple statement\nlike, “OK, I’ll give you this one,” or “I will meet you halfway,” show you\nare willing to concede.\n» Demand and defi ne reciprocity: You can start by planting the seeds\nof reciprocation and this increases your chances of getting something in\nreturn. An easy way to start planting these seeds is through nonverbal\ncommunication showing that you are fl exible, and also by being a good\nlistener. Th ese little things can make a big diff erence when building feel-\nings of reciprocation in your target.\n» Make contingent concessions: You can use “risk-free” concessions\nwhen trust is low or when you need to signal that you are ready to make\nother concessions. What I mean by this is a concession that does not\ncome with a “now you can do something for me” attitude. By giving in to\nsomething the target wants or needs with no counter demand, you can\nbuild a very strong bond with the target.\n» Make concessions in installments: Th e idea of reciprocity is deeply\ningrained in our minds. Most people feel that if someone does them a\nfavor then they are socially contracted to eventually return that favor.\nSimilarly, if someone makes a concession, say in a negotiation or bargain-\ning agreement, then one instinctively feels obligated to “budge” a little bit,\ntoo. Since this is a fact, you do not have to feel that all your concessions\nmust be at one time. You can make “installments” with your concessions,\nwhere you give in a little here and a little there over time to keep your tar-\nget reciprocating.\nConcessions are used daily by salespeople, negotiators, and social engineers. A\nsuccessful social engineer can use and abuse this instinctual tendency by not only\nresisting the manipulations being placed on them by others but also by trying to take\nover the situation completely. Concession and reciprocation skills play well with many\nof the other social engineering techniques discussed within the pages of this book.",
    "question": "How can a social engineer effectively use the principle of reciprocity to influence others during an audit?",
    "summary": "Reciprocity is a key influence tactic where giving something valuable creates a sense of obligation in the recipient. Social engineers use this by offering small, meaningful gifts or information that makes the target feel indebted. They also leverage obligation through actions like holding doors or using polite compliments to encourage the target to help them. These principles help social engineers build trust and influence others effectively."

    "text": "INFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 195\nAn example of how many people fall for concessions can be illustrated with\ntelemarketers who call for donations. Th ey use a strategy for gaining concessions\nafter someone is fi rst given the opportunity to turn down a large request. Th e same\nrequester counteroff ers with a smaller request that you are more likely to accept\nthan the large request.\nLarge request: “Can you donate $200 to our charity?”\nResponse: “No, I cannot.”\nSmaller request: “Oh, I’m sorry sir, and I understand. Can you donate only $20?”\nPeople who are not aware of this technique might feel like the burden is taken\noff of them and realize they can part with a mere $20 rather than the initial asking\nprice of $200.\nAnother great example appeared in an article (http://ezinearticles\n.com/?How-to-Negotiate-the-Salary-Using-the-Power-of-the-Norm-of-\nReciprocity&id=2449465) written by David Hill:\nThe power of this norm can be felt in most bargaining situations.\nAssume a buyer and a seller are haggling over the price of a car.\nThe seller starts out with a bid at $24,000. The buyer finds this\noffer unacceptable and makes a counter bid at $15,000. Now, the\nseller lowers his bid to $20,000, i.e., he makes a concession. In this\ncase, the buyer will most often feel inclined to increase his bid,\nmaybe to $17,000. The reason why the buyer will feel this inclina-\ntion is because of the presence of the norm of reciprocity. This norm\nnow demands that the buyer responds to the seller’s concession with\nanother concession.\nAs with most of the principles discussed so far, the concession must be valuable\nto the receiver. You can’t concede something that is valuable only to you or you lose\nthe power you gain with a good concession.\nAs a social engineer, not giving a concession that will cause you to lose face, rap-\nport, or your position is also imperative. A delicate balance must exist between the\nconcession and your standing with the target, and fi nding it is half the work. Find\nit, though, and concessions can be a very serious tool in your hands.\nScarcity\nPeople often fi nd objects and opportunities more attractive if they are rare, scarce,\nor hard to obtain. Th is is why you will see newspapers and radio ads fi lled with\n196 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n“Last Day,” “Limited Time Only,” “Only 3-Day Sale,” and “Going Out of Business\nForever” messages that entice people to come from all over to get a share of the\nsoon-to-be-never-seen-again product.\nTh e use of scarcity in the sales context is best known with the catch phrase “Act\nnow! Supplies are limited!” Other techniques are the common “Th e fi rst X callers\nget a free widget,” or having an intentional short supply of a popular product. In\nrecent times, this practice was most popularly alleged with the Nintendo Wii. Jason\nDobson, a writer for Gamasutra, said, “But I think [Nintendo] intentionally dried\nup supply because they made their numbers for the year. Th e new year starts April\n1, and I think we’re going to see supply fl owing” (www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/\nnews_index.php?story=13297).\nWhere I live, a car dealership ran an ad on a Th ursday stating it had to get rid\nof X number of cars due to new stock arriving. Th e prices were so low and some of\nthe cars—wait for it—were no longer being produced, and that weekend was the last\nweekend ever that you could come in for a piece of auto-selling history.\nTh e sales went through the roof that weekend, so the sale was over right? Nope,\nthat ad ran every Th ursday for more than three months. I often wondered how people\njust didn’t catch on to it, but the dealership sold a lot of cars using this method.\nSocial events can often appear to be more exclusive if scarcity is introduced. Th e\nperceived social benefi t of attending these events often goes up in these circum-\nstances. In advertising, this point is driven home with ads for music events that\npoint out how the last concert was quickly sold out.\nMany popular restaurants have been known to close off sections of the restau-\nrant to appear busier than they really are. Th e perception that they are extremely\npopular can often trigger a heightened desire to eat at that establishment. To see\nan ad that actually mentions the use of scarcity in promoting an event, go to www\n.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/Scarcity/Scarcity-Advertisment.html.\nTh is ad played on four major components of scarcity:\n» Th e launch is limited access.\n» Th e application is not public and only limited.\n» Promoters are handpicked and limited.\n» Th e e-book is free to those lucky enough to be chosen to come.\nAll of these points use scarcity by making the would-be partygoers feel that get-\nting into this event is so diffi cult that only the elite, the few, and the proud can even\nhave a remote chance of stepping foot onto that hallowed ground.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 197\nTh e basics of economics are made up of the allocation of resources that have\nalternative uses. Th is allocation is driven by the scarcity of the objects that are being\nallocated. Th e rarer the resource, the higher the perceived value the object retains.\nTh is rarity is why gold is worth more than salt, which is worth more than clay.\nAlso, within daily interactions scarcity is often used. Scarcity can be introduced\ninto social situations in an attempt to make something one has go up in value. For\ninstance, one might act like he is very busy on a regular basis, and free time is hard\nto come by. Th is action may excuse him from not spending time with someone he\nmay have an obligation to spend time with, and at the same time make time that is\nspent seem that much more valuable.\nYou can manipulate attention through the use of scarcity as well. Th ink of how\nmany people complain about salesmen bothering them in a store when there is no\nscarcity of salespeople’s attention, yet they are just as upset when they are ignored\nby salespeople when their attention is scarce. On the whole, people are driven to\ndesire that which is hard to obtain, because it is viewed as having more value. Th is\nholds true for attention as well.\nScarcity is often used in social engineering contexts to create a feeling of urgency\nin a decision-making context. Th is urgency can often lead to manipulation of the\ndecision-making process, allowing the social engineer to control the information\nprovided to the victim. Th is is done commonly by using a mixture of authority and\nscarcity principles. For example, saying something like, “Th e CFO, Mr. Smith, called\nme before he left for the long weekend and told me to come down and fi x his email\nproblem. He said he was sick and tired of the crashes and wanted it fi xed before\nMonday.” Th is creates urgency alongside scarcity in that the CFO is not available\nto speak to and time is the scarce item.\nUsing scarcity mixed with other principles can also make the attack even deadlier.\nEither way, scarcity creates a desire and that desire can lead someone to making a\ndecision he might regret later.\nTh is was proven to me recently when a truck pulled into my driveway with a\nfreezer in the back. Th is decently dressed young man approached my wife and\nexplained that he is a meat salesman. He delivers meat to customers and was just\nabout to head back to the offi ce and saw her working in the yard. He began talk-\ning about meat prices and how expensive things are in the store. My wife is a very\nprice-conscious shopper, so this built rapport. Plus he had a very pleasant southern\naccent and called her “ma’am” and was very respectful.\nAfter a few minutes of talking, she blurts out the question that usually stops\nsalesmen dead, “How much do you want?”\n198 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nWithout missing too much of a beat he says, “Listen, I have been selling these all\nday for $400 per box, but this is my last box. I would love to just go back to the offi ce\nwith an empty freezer and give you some high-quality meat in the meantime.”\nOh no, the last box! He told her before he only comes through once every two\nmonths. Th e desire has been raised, but my wife is no dummy. She knew she was\nbeing manipulated. She excused herself and came to get me.\nHe went through his spiel and laid on the scarcity thick. Of course, this type of\nan account can be a lesson on how to not fall for this tactic. Th e problem is that\nemotion gets involved. He sees that I have a grill outside that looks used, so he knows\nI love to cook outside and he plays on that. He then talks about the quality of meat\nand quickly makes comparisons to restaurant quality and what is in his boxes.\nMany people could easily fall for the emotional aspect of his sales pitch. “What\nif it is his last one?” “He is right, this is much cheaper than eating out.” “He comes\nto me…I don’t even have to drive to the store.”\nInstead, I whipped out a calculator and asked him for the amount for the two\nlast boxes, divided by the weight and then asked my wife how much she normally\npays per pound for a Delmonico or ribeye in the store. When her price came in\nlower by $3.00 per pound I simply just shut up. Now his emotions get involved. He\nscrambles to save face. He lowers his price by $150 off the bat. I again do the math\nand he is still $.50 more per pound.\nHe tries to talk about quality, convenience, and all those aspects that make it\nworth the $.50 more. I shift my posture and position to be away from him and to\nshow disinterest. Without saying anything, he trails off at the end of a weak spiel\nand off ers me another $50 off . I tell him, “Sorry, I just don’t think it’s worth it.”\nHe then does the classic mistake that shows how his claims of scarcity were\nfalse—he caves in more. “How much do you want to pay for these boxes?”\n“I probably could do $100.”\n“If you can give me $125 we can call it a deal.”\nNow mind you a little bit ago he was at $400 per box and they were the last two\nin this area for two to three months. Th is should have been a bidding war for that\nvalue, but instead, I sent him packing with his two boxes of meat and no cash.\nTh e lesson in this story for social engineers is that for scarcity to work it either\nhas to be real, or you have to stick to your guns to give the appearance of reality.\nPeople will perceive the value higher when something is really in need. A mali-\ncious example of this is how the petrol companies raised the prices of fuel after\nHurricane Katrina. Th e claim was that fuel was in shortage due to the destruction,\nwhich caused terrible price increases. Of course, if this were true then the fuel would\nbe worth a lot more than it is; instead it was an example of the claim of scarcity used\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 199\nto make money. Yet at the same time, when BP’s error caused millions of gallons\nof oil to be lost in the Gulf of Mexico, ruining the ecosystem, instead of fuel prices\nskyrocketing due to lack of supply, they dropped. How? Well I won’t get into that\nhere, but it proves the point that for scarcity to work, it has to be believable, and this\nwhere the oil companies fail and where social engineers can fail, too.\nFrom a social engineer’s standpoint, the more limited or diffi cult it is obtain an\nopportunity the more value it will have to people. If information is deemed as pri-\nvate, restricted, and hard to come by, and you are willing to share it with someone,\nyou have just gained a lot of value in their eyes.\nA social engineer can leverage scarcity with information by using a statement\nlike, “I am not supposed to be saying this but…” or “I am not sure if you heard this\nnews, but I overheard…” Statements like these spoken in hushed tones imply that\nthis information is scarce.\nAuthority\nPeople are more willing to follow the directions or recommendations of someone\nthey view as an authority. Finding a person who has enough assertiveness to ques-\ntion authority directly, especially when that authority holds direct power over him\nor is face-to-face with him is uncommon.\nChildren, for example, are taught to obey adults such as teachers, counselors,\npriests, and nannies because they have authority over them. Often, questioning\nauthority is deemed as disrespectful and abject obedience is what is rewarded. Th ese\nprinciples carry over into adult life because we are taught to respect authority fi gures\nand not question rules or orders given to us by those whom we deem authorities.\nUnfortunately, it is this principle leads many children into the hands of abusers\nand molesters. Of course, not this principle solely, but those who prey on children\nrealize how children are taught about authority and often seek out those who appear\nto be more compliant. Similarly, malicious social engineers use this principle to\nmanipulate their targets to take some action or inaction that can lead to a breach.\nUnderstanding how authority is used from a social engineering aspect is important.\nGerman sociologist and political economist, Max Weber, defi ned authority into cat-\negories that I have adapted to fi t more closely into the realm of social engineering.\nLegal Authority\nLegal authority is based upon government and law. Th is generally applies to law\nenforcement offi cers or others who enforce the laws of the land, area, or facility\nyou are presently in.\n200 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nAs a social engineer, pretexts that involve law enforcement or other government\noffi cials are usually illegal. However, security guards, bank security, or other types\nof enforcement authority fi gures can be well represented and are often used by\nsocial engineers.\nIn one episode of the BBC television program Th e Real Hustle, Paul Wilson and\nhis cohorts dressed up like the guards who collect the money. When someone shows\nup in the uniforms that look similar to the real ones and acts as a normal person in\nthat authoritative position would act, targets have little reason to doubt the imposter\nis who he “says” he is. Acting as an authority fi gure is a major ploy used by social\nengineers to gain access to a company.\nAnother ploy that can be eff ective is posing as a lawyer who is seeking certain\ninformation. Playing a role that is generally feared or respected by the masses can\nbe one way a legal authority ploy is used.\nOrganizational Authority\nOrganizational authority is quite simply any authority defi ned by means of an orga-\nnization. Typically, this refers to a supervisory hierarchy. Someone within a position\nof power in an organization has more power and access to more information than\nsomeone at the bottom of the hierarchy.\nIn a social engineering audit, a consultant may impersonate the CIO or someone\nelse with clearly defi ned organizational authority. Th e consultant may then be able\nto obtain passwords or other information from the help desk or any other employee\nwho may perceive that the impersonated person has authority over him or her.\nIn a paper entitled “Th e ‘Social Engineering’ of the Internet Fraud” Jonathan J.\nRusch of the U.S. Department of Justice writes, “People are highly likely, in the right\nsituation, to be highly responsive to assertions of authority, even when the person\nwho purports to be in a position of authority is not physically present” (www.isoc\n.org/inet99/proceedings/3g/3g_2.htm).\nTh is ploy is used in other ways, by not acting as if you are the CFO, but instead\nsent or authorized by the CFO. Th e authority the name and title wields may be\nenough to grant that power to the attacker in the eyes of the target.\nRusch cites an experiment performed by Robert B. Cialdini and recorded in his\nbook Infl uence (1993), which showed 95 percent of nurses within 22 stations from\nthree diff erent hospitals were willing to administer patients a dangerous dose of\nmedication based upon a phone call from a researcher purporting to be a physician\nthe nurses had never met.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 201\nTh is experiment clearly shows that based upon orders and the perceived notion\nof authority, people might take certain actions despite their better judgment. Th is\ntype of authority can and is often used to exploit companies into giving away valu-\nable data.\nSocial Authority\nSocial authority refers to the “natural-born leaders” of any social group. A social group\ncould consist of co-workers, college friends, or any other gathering of people.\nIn Infl uence, Cialdini writes, “When reacting to authority in an automatic fash-\nion there is a tendency to often do so in response to the mere symbols of authority\nrather than to its substance.”\nFor social authority to occur, an extraordinary amount of time or structure may\nnot be needed to defi ne an authoritative fi gure. In any setting, a quick fl ash of social\nproof, where people are infl uenced by a group of people taking the same action, may\nhelp provide a person social authority.\nSocial authority can be used to an advantage in social engineering by asking or\npressuring the target for information. If the target refuses and is therefore not liked\nby the leader of the group, the target may fall out of favor with the entire group.\nComplying with the leader’s social authority is perceived to be advantageous.\nSocial authority is successfully used when either directly stated or implied that\na previous person or group reacted the way that the attacker is asking. “Yesterday\nthe CFO sent me down to take care of this problem and Joe let me through and he\nchecked all my credentials, did he put them on fi le?” A simple statement like that\nutilizes a few forms of authority.\nIf you comply with authorities mindlessly, you may respond to symbols of authority\nrather than to reality. Th ree authority symbols are particularly eff ective in Western\ncountries—you may reward people with any one of these (and no other evidence of\nauthority) for their compliance:\n» Titles\n» Clothes\n» Automobiles\nIn an interview I conducted with Dr. Ellen Langer, Harvard psychologist and\nresearcher of persuasion and infl uence (www.social-engineer.org/episode-007-\nusing-persuasion-on-the-mindless-masses), she talked extensively about mind-\nlessness. She stated that people often do much of their work in a state where there is\nnot much thought; in other words, they are in autopilot. In those positions, the abuse\n202 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nof the authority role is very dangerous. Perceived authority can make someone on\nautopilot react without limits.\nUsing the right clothes, body language, and even having a fake business card\nprinted has worked for many social engineers in presenting an authority stance and\nkeeping their targets in autopilot.\nOther forms of authority may come into play for a social engineer than the ones\noutlined here, but these are the most commonly used. Authority is a powerful\nforce when it comes to infl uencing others, and with a little bit of reasoning and\ninformation gathering a social engineer can eff ectively use an authority pretext to\nhis or her advantage.\nCommitment and Consistency\nPeople value consistency in others, and they also want to appear consistent in their\nown behavior. Generally people probably want their words, attitudes, and deeds to\nbe consistent and congruent. Consistency reduces the need to reprocess informa-\ntion and off ers shortcuts through complex decisions.\nGut feelings—those moments where you sense that an action is good or bad, or\nright or wrong, based on past experience—are often indicators that a decision being\nmade might be against previously committed feelings and beliefs. Th ese signals often\nindicate that you feel pushed to agree to something that you don’t want.\nGut feelings can also occur when it comes to making commitments. Gut feelings\nmay indicate that you are uncertain of whether your commitment was a mistake.\nYou can ask yourself, “Knowing what I now know, if I could do that again, would I\nmake the same commitment?”\nBefore looking at how a social engineer can use consistency to gain someone’s\ncommitment, take a look at three examples that might help hit this point home.\n» Marketing: Companies often spend extraordinary amounts of money\nto gain market share. Th ere is no real return, but they fi ght to remain\nin that share that they believe to be profi table. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are\ngreat examples of using marketing throughout the decades in the fi ght to\nremain visible, yet often a commercial will not sway a person to switch\nfrom Pepsi to Coke. Because the two companies have been “committed”\nto the war against each other it seems that when one of them comes out\nwith a new product or marketing idea, the other is not too far behind.\n» Auctions: Th e increased popularity of online auction houses such as\neBay has this principle more visible. People feel a level of commitment\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 203\nto something they place a bid on and if someone outbids them it is as if\nthey are compelled to bid again. At times they will even increase the bid\nway past their comfort zone because they feel committed. One classic\nexample of this is when Robert Campeau bought Bloomingdales. He paid\n$600 million dollars more than it was worth. Max Bazerman, author of\nNegotiating Rationally quoted a journalist from the Wall Street Journal\nas saying, “We are not dealing with price anymore, but with egos….”\n» Carnivals, game houses, and so on: Anytime gambling or game houses\nare involved a greater risk exists of commitment and consistency being\nused to persuade people. One columnist, Ryan Healy, an online market-\ning consultant, wrote a story about when he took his daughter to a circus\n(www.ryanhealy.com/commitment-and-consistency/). He spent $44\non the tickets, $5 to park his car, then 40 minutes of drive time to get\nthere. He was committed to being at the circus. His daughter wanted cot-\nton candy so he committed to a yes by giving her $5. How could cotton\ncandy cost more than that? When the vendor came by and said the bag\nwas $12, how could he back out on his commitment now? He couldn’t,\nand therefore ended up spending the $12 on a single cotton candy.\nConsistency in this pretense is defi ned as what is expected based on previous\nexperience or expectations. Th at experience or expectation can motivate a target\nto take an action that can cause a breach. For example, when the tech support guy\ncomes it is expected he will go to the server room. Th at request is consistent with the\nprevious experience and expectation. When access to the server room is requested,\nit is more likely to be fulfi lled because it is consistent with what is expected.\nCommitment and consistency can be strong infl uence factors upon most people\nto take actions, give information, or divulge secrets.\nA social engineer can make commitment and consistency some of the most\npowerful tools in his or her arsenal. If a social engineer can get a target to commit\nto something small, usually escalating the commitment is not too hard.\nIn his book Infl uence, Robert Cialdini writes:\nThe key to using the principles of Commitment and Consistency to\nmanipulate people is held within the initial commitment. That is—\nafter making a commitment, taking a stand or position, people are\nmore willing to agree to requests that are consistent with their prior\ncommitment. Many compliance professionals will try to induce oth-\ners to take an initial position that is consistent with a behavior they\nwill later request.\n204 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh e social engineer hoping to employ the technique of commitment and consis-\ntency usually tries to get the target to divulge a small piece of information toward\nthe overall intended goal. By getting the subject to remain consistent with things\nhe or she has already said, the attacker may get the subject to reveal even more\ninformation.\nOn the other hand, the attacker must remain consistent with what he is asking.\nTh e attacker should start off small and escalate the information gathering.\nTo use an unrealistic example, an attacker should never start off asking for the\nnuclear launch codes. Th is request will be denied, and the attacker will be left few\noptions but to backpedal the request. However, starting off small and escalating\nthe value of the information requested with each new piece of gathered informa-\ntion will seem like a more natural progression and will not appear so obvious to\nthe victim.\nGoing slowly and progressively can be hard as social engineers are often impatient\nand want to get the “password” right now. Playing it cool and remaining patient can\nmake this avenue rewarding. Clearly defi ning, maybe even writing out, a path that\nyou can use on each audit can help you go into the audit with clearly defi ned goals\nand a path to accomplish them.\nI created a chart you can see in Figure 6-2 that shows how a social engineer\nmay be able to visualize this path to obtain information using commitment and\nconsistency.\nGetting a target to verbally commit to a certain action can force the target into a\ncertain path of action. Cialdini states, “Th e commitment and consistency rule states\nthat once we make a decision, we will experience pressure from others and ourselves\nto behave consistently with that decision. You can be pressured into making either\ngood or bad decisions depending on your past actions.”\nMaybe you have felt this if you ever verbally told your wife or spouse that you\nwanted to lose weight. Th at verbal “commitment” leads to a lot of pressure to hold\nup to your end of the “bargain.”\nSometimes, ending up disagreeing with yourself can be hard and almost impossi-\nble. Everyone has, at one point or another muttered the phrase, “I’m sorry, I changed\nmy mind,” at least once in our lives. When we do, we hang our head in shame, our\nvoice tones drop, and we sound sad. Why? We have just broken a commitment we\nmade and we feel guilty for doing it.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 205\nUsing Commitment\nand Consistency to\nHarvest Information\nAsk questions the target must\nanswer “YES”\nThe desire to see “self” as consistent\nis a powerful motivator\nPeople desire to be called consistent\nby others too\nA verbal, public, non-coerced\ncommitment will be almost\nimpossible for the person to go\nback on . . .\nUse escalation to increase the\nseriousness of what they are\ncommitting to\nObtaining\nInformation\nCommitment\nFigure 6-2 Clearly defining your goals can help\nyou to obtain an information commitment.\nEven small, seemingly insignifi cant commitments can lead to exploitation. For\nexample, a phone conversation often used by solicitors goes something like this:\n“Hello, how are you today?”\nYou answer, “I am doing great.”\nNow, prepare for the exploit: “Th at is good to hear, because some people who\nare not doing so great can use your help.”\nYou can’t go back on what you said now, because you are still doing great and\ncommitted to it.\nTh is is not to say that you need to be so paranoid that you cannot even answer\nsimple questions without the fear of exploitation, but being aware that one\n206 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ncommitment does not mean you must commit to everything that follows is vital. I\nonce worked with a guy who could literally get anyone to do the worst jobs and make\nthem think it was their idea. Ensuring their commitment was one method he used.\nIf you committed to a path of agreeing with him on certain things, which was\nalmost impossible not to do, because he got you to say “yes” upfront, then you had\nto continue to say “yes.” Th ose yeses lead down one path, and that path was right to\nwhere he wanted, agreeing to the job he needed to get done.\nBeing aware that it is okay to say “no” can save you from committing to something\nthat could be disastrous. Yet sometimes we convince ourselves that saying “no” is\nsome form of cardinal sin that needs many prayers to be forgiven.\nIn the earlier example of the frozen meat salesman, my wife is a very self-aware\nperson. Knowing she might be manipulated by a “seemingly good deal” she came\ninside to get me because I am a “jerk.”\nOne of the best examples I have heard that really shows the power of commitment\nis a social experiment done by Dr. Th omas Moriarty in 1972. He sent an assistant\nto the beach as a “victim” with a portable radio. Th e victim sat in his chair listening\nto his radio for about 10 minutes, then he got up to go purchase a drink.\nWhile he was gone, another assistant, the “criminal” who no one knew was\nworking with him, came by to “steal” the radio. Only 4 out of 20 people—that’s only\n20%—stopped the thief from taking the radio.\nTh e researchers then upped the ante in the next round. Before the “victim” would\nleave to buy the drink he would ask one of the neighboring sunbathers to watch his\nradio for him. What do you think the change was?\nNow a staggering 19 out of 20 stopped the thief, some even resorting to vio-\nlence. Why the staggering diff erence? Commitment and consistency. Th e researcher\nobtained commitment from the neighboring sunbathers and that caused them to\nhave to act consistently with that commitment. In my opinion, these are amazing\nstatistics that show the power of this infl uence method.\nA social engineer can eff ectively use this method of infl uence to get a target to\ncommit to even a small act or small “yes” and use that commitment to escalate it\ninto a larger set of actions.\nLiking\nPeople like people who like them. As tongue twisting as that phrase is, it is a very\ntrue statement. Understanding the full depth of that statement gets you much closer\nto mastering persuasion.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 207\nWhen I say understand the depth, I really mean that because that sentence has\nmuch more to it than meets the eye.\nTh is statement isn’t saying that people who like you will respond well. Salespeople\nare often taught that people buy from people they like. Th at is true, but not the point.\nIt also isn’t saying that people must like you—it is saying you must like people and\nthen they will like you in return.\nTh is task is not as easy as it sounds because liking someone cannot be faked. As\ndiscussed in Chapter 5, smiles and happiness are very hard to fake. You must go into\nthe circumstance genuinely caring for the person who you are trying to infl uence.\nCaring for people and their feelings is not a standard practice of the malicious social\nengineer; therefore, they often rely on charm. Charm can work on a short-term basis,\nbut in the long term, liking people is a practiced and learned skill.\nLiking is used in marketing extensively. In 1990 Jonathan Frenzen and Harry\nDavis published a study entitled, “Purchasing Behavior in Embedded Markets” (www\n.jstor.org/pss/2626820) that examined why Tupperware parties are so success-\nful. All of their research led to this principle of liking.\nTh e researchers concluded that most people bought because they wanted the\nhostess to be happy, to help a friend, and to be liked. How embarrassing to go to a\nparty like this and not buy anything! Th at fear of not being liked is what will drive\nmost people to purchase at these parties and it has little to do with wanting more\nTupperware.\nOther surveys and studies have compared the trust that people have in receiving\n“tips or advice” from those they consider friends to the trust they have in complete\nstrangers or worse, people they don’t like. A friend can give bad advice and one may\nbe more prone to follow it than good advice from a person one doesn’t like.\nFrom a social engineering aspect the concept of liking is a powerful tool. Not\nonly do you have to be likeable and win their trust, but you also have to genuinely\nbe interested in people. Th is concept goes back to the discussion of pretexting in\nChapter 4. When you pretext, you are not merely acting out an idea or belief—you\nmust become the person you are pretexting; that role is what your life is about. If\nyou can do that then the step of liking can become easier. Your pretext will be truly\ninterested in helping, liking, or assisting that person.\nOne last aspect of liking that is important for you as a social engineer is physical\nattractiveness. Humans tend to automatically “like” those who we fi nd attractive.\nAs vain as that sounds, it is the truth. Some serious psychological principles back\nup this idea.\n208 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nWhat is beautiful is good. In 1972 Berscheid, Walster, and Dion performed a\nstudy entitled just that, “What Is Beautiful Is Good,” which unleashed some very\nprofound fi ndings. Participants were asked to rate photos of three individuals rang-\ning from low, medium, and high attractiveness. Based on the photos alone they\nwere to rate the people for personality traits, overall happiness, and career success.\nTh ey then compiled the ratings and averaged them and found that people who\nwere deemed attractive were more socially desirable, had better occupations, were\nhappier, and more successful. Th e study proved that people tend to link beauty with\nother successful qualities and it alters their opinions and ability to trust someone.\nTh is study is an example of a phenomenon called the halo eff ect, where one\nparticular trait infl uences or extends to the other qualities of the person. It has\nbeen proven to bias a person’s decisions with a tendency to focus on the good traits\nof the other person. I have archived a copy of this amazing study at www.social-\nengineer.org/wiki/archives/BlogPosts/BeautifulGood.pdf.\nIn other words, if someone views you as beautiful, then that good trait extends\nto other judgments that person makes about you. Th is halo eff ect is often used in\nmarketing. Beautiful people are given products to drink, eat, and wear, and other\npeople will automatically assume these things are good, possibly thinking, “Well it\nmust be good if this beautiful person is using it.”\nRecently I saw an ad on television that really hit this point home—the ad makes\nfun of marketing eff orts but does it very intelligently. An attractive young female\ncomes on the screen wearing beautiful clothing and says, “Hi, I am a believably\nattractive 18–24 year old female.”\nUsing an attractive female who is not overly attractive, but believably real, some-\none we normal people can look up to is marketing genius. We can’t really tell her\nage but her beauty can place her somewhere between the ages of 18–24.\n“You can relate to me because I am racially ambiguous.”\nAgain, this is another marketing genius tip. She is not black, white, or Native\nAmerican—we can’t tell, but she may be a mix, which may be attractive to many\nraces and is non-off ensive to most.\n“I am in this commercial because market research shows girls like you love girls\nlike me.”\nHer beauty and self-assuredness makes us like her; she is well dressed, well spo-\nken, and we want to know her.\nTh e camera then pans to diff erent shots of her doing things like kickboxing,\ncheerleading, and playing with fl owers. By showing viewers she can do all these\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 209\nthings while being as beautiful as she is, we perceive her as strong and powerful,\nand all the things she’s doing as good.\n“Now I am going to tell you to buy something…”\nShe then goes on to sell tampons. Th is commercial is genius, because the adver-\ntiser actually outlines, uses, and educates the consumer on the methods used to\nmake you want to buy. But despite all that, within this commercial lies this principle\nof liking and the halo eff ect.\nKnowing all this about the importance of liking, what can you do? I have a hard\nenough time becoming an attractive male, let alone an attractive female. Because\nendless runs to my local plastic surgeon are out, is there anything a social engineer\ncan do to capitalize on this principle?\nKnow your target. Know what is and isn’t acceptable to him or her. How does\nhe dress, and what does he consider bad and good? Too much jewelry, makeup, or\nother aspect of dress can turn off a target. Suppose you are auditing a doctor’s offi ce\nand your pretext is a drug sales representative. You know that most sales reps wear\nsuits; have perfect hair; and look, smell, and act confi dent, a trait of many attrac-\ntive people, so walking in with spiked hair and facial piercings would draw more\nattention to yourself than your goal.\nYou must know your target so you can successfully look the way the target would\nexpect. Wear clothing, hairstyles, jewelry, and makeup that will not shock, surprise,\nor disgust the target. Putting her mind at ease can go a long way toward creating an\natmosphere where she will like you, which will build trust and lead to success.\nA social engineer can look for things to compliment a target on. When engaging\na target, and when appropriate, starting the conversation with a simple complimen-\ntary question (such as “Th ose are nice shoes; where did you buy them?”) is useful.\nPeople like positive reinforcement. When one receives compliments from another,\nhe tends to stay engaged in order to receive more positive reinforcement. Th ese\ncompliments tend to reinforce a target’s self image, making him feel as if you have\na greater-than-normal understanding of him.\nTh e University of Minnesota issued a paper (www.cehd.umn.edu/ceed/publica-\ntions/tipsheets/preschoolbehaviortipsheets/posrein.pdf) about reinforce-\nment which states that too much positive reinforcement can have a negative eff ect.\nTh ey call it satiation, which means that when reinforcement is given too much it\nbegins to lose its eff ectiveness. To combat this eff ect, you can use positive reinforce-\nment backed up by a question. Th is method reinforces positive behavior or attitudes\nbut also makes people happy as they are asked about themselves.\n210 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFour steps can help you get people to like you:\n1. Project a confi dent and positive attitude.\n2. Establish rapport.\n3. Synchronize, or get in tune with the target and surroundings using the\nmethods mentioned earlier.\n4. Eff ectively communicate.\nIn his book How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds, Nicholas Boothman\nsays that people decide whether they like someone in the fi rst two seconds of meet-\ning him or her. After an impression is made changing it can be hard. He promotes\ncoming into an interaction with a good attitude. Having the ability to speak up and\ncommunicate eff ectively in many diff erent situations can make you more likeable.\nWhat you project onto others is what they will feel. Your facial expressions, body\nlanguage, dress, and so on must all project a good, positive attitude.\nBoothman says some key things in his book about being likeable, including to\nask lots of questions, actively listen, and be interested in what people are saying.\nDoing these things will help people like you.\nA social engineer may need to practice it, but being likeable will go a long way\ntoward succeeding in your audits.\nConsensus or Social Proof\nSocial proof is a psychological phenomenon that occurs in social situations when\npeople are unable to determine the appropriate mode of behavior. You can easily\nassume a behavior is appropriate if you see others acting or talking a certain way.\nSocial infl uence in general can lead to conformity of large groups of individuals in\neither correct or mistaken choices. Th is behavior is common when people enter\ninto unfamiliar situations and don’t have a frame of reference on how to deal with\nthe situation; they mirror their behavior off of others whom they assume are more\nfamiliar and therefore better informed.\nIn his book, Infl uence: Th e Psychology of Persuasion, Dr. Robert Cialdini states,\n“Social proof—people will do things that they see other people are doing. For\nexample, in one experiment, one or more confederates would look up into the\nsky; bystanders would then look up into the sky to see what they were seeing. At\none point this experiment is aborted, as so many people were looking up that they\nstopped traffi c.”\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 211\nI will outline some excellent examples of social proof that will help you to see\nhow powerful it is and if you have ever fallen for it.\nSocial proof is used heavily in marketing. Social proof is utilized in sales\nwhen high sales numbers are released, demonstrating to potential customers\nthat the product is popular. Another example is when companies release shirts\nwith logos or slogans printed on them, where the wearer then gives an implicit\nendorsement.\nSocial proof is not just infl uenced by large groups, but also by high-profi le indi-\nviduals. For instance, a single celebrity becoming associated with product will make\nothers want to be associated with the celebrity’s positive traits, and they will then\nuse the same product.\nMany examples exist of celebrity endorsements, here are a just a few:\n» A major supplier of berets was able to get Samuel L. Jackson to endorse\ntheir product, Th e Kangol hat.\n» Right through 2010 Maria Sharapova was paid millions in USD per year\nto endorse Canon products.\n» Catherine Zeta Jones endorses T-Mobile Products in their TV commer-\ncials and print ads to the tune of $20 million in USD.\n» In 2009, Tiger Woods was paid over $100 million in USD for his off -\ncourse product endorsements like AT&T, Gatorade, Gillette, Nike Golf\nand TAG HEUER to name a few.\n» Michael Jordan still earns $45 million in USD per year for his Nike\nendorsements.\nTh ere are even some more unusual celebrity endorsements like:\n» Ozzy Osbourne endorsing I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter\n» Mikhail Gorbachev endorsing Louis Vuitton\n» Ben Stiller endorsing the alcoholic drink Chu High to Japanese Viewers\nWhy do companies spend so much just to have a celebrity endorse their\nproducts?\nIt is exactly how social proof works. When consumers see famous people they\nadmire and adore wearing, using or even speaking about those products, it is as if\nthey are being told directly by that person how amazing that product is. Many will\nview it as solid proof that these products are worth every penny.\n212 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nIn its marketing eff orts the company said its hats were some of the hottest on the\nmarket and the proof was that Mr. Jackson can be seen wearing them.\nAdvertisers often say things like, “largest selling” or “hottest product” to convince\ntheir audience that they have the backing of many of our peers in these claims.\nIn addition, the Media-Studies.ca website posted an article on infl uencing its\ntargets using social proof (www.media-studies.ca/articles/influence_ch4.htm):\nExperiments have found that the use of canned laughter causes an\naudience to laugh longer and more often when humorous material\nis presented and to rate the material as funnier. In addition, some\nevidence indicates that canned laughter is most effective for poor\njokes.” The question is: why does it work, especially when the laugh\ntrack is often so obviously fake? To answer this question, Cialdini\nposits the principle of social proof: “One means we use to determine\nwhat is correct is to find out what other people think is correct…We\nview a behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degree\nthat we see others performing it.”\nAs with the other “weapons of infl uence,” social proof is a shortcut that usually\nworks well for us: if we conform to the behavior we see around us, we are less likely\nto make a social faux pas. Th e fact that canned laughter provokes an automatic\nresponse in audiences suggests that auditory cues are powerful stimuli because they\ninfl uence us at a level of consciousness that is diffi cult to critique.\nOther examples are how bartenders or other establishments will “salt the tip jar,”\nby placing a few bills in the jar. As a patron approaches to purchase food the implica-\ntion is, “Many before you have tipped me, why don’t you?” And it works, too!\nOne of the most profound bits of research in this fi eld that really stands out was done\nby Dr. K. D. Craig in 1978. Dr. Craig devoted his life to the study of pain and its eff ect on\npeople. In 1978 he published a paper entitled “Social Modeling Infl uences on Sensory\nDecision Th eory and Psychophysiological Indexes of Pain” (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\npubmed/690805?dopt=Abstract), in which he did an experiment that he described as:\nSubjects exposed to social models dissimulating tolerance or intol-\nerance generally exhibit matching behavior in their verbal ratings\nof painful stimulation. It has been unclear, however, whether these\nchanges reflect voluntary alteration of evidence or genuine changes\nin distress.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 213\nThis study used alternative measures and controlled for method-\nological limitations of earlier studies by examining non-palmar\nskin potential in addition to palmar skin conductance and heart\nrate indexes of psycho-physiological response to electric shock,\nand by evaluating verbal expressions of pain with sensory decision\ntheory methodology.\nSeveral indexes of non-palmar skin potential and heart rate reac-\ntivity exhibited lower reactivity in the tolerant group. Tolerant\nmodeling was also associated with decreases in subjective stress.\nThe results were consistent with the position that changes in pain\nindexes associated with exposure to a tolerant model represented\nvariations in fundamental characteristics of painful experiences as\nopposed to suppression of information.\nTo boil this down, what he basically did was shock people and ask them to rate\ntheir pain level. Th en using similar but varying shocks did the same test in the\npresence of a person who was “tolerant” to the pain; it was as if a magical cloak was\nover the subject, because they were now more tolerant to pain.\nTh is experiment points to the fact that part of the motivation to show, exhibit,\nor feel pain is related to how others around you act. Th e people in the study weren’t\njust acting like it hurt less: Th eir skin reactions and heart rate actually exhibited\nless pain reaction when a tolerant model was in place.\nFor a humorous example of the power of social proof, check out a video from\nthe old television show Candid Camera at www.social-engineer.org/framework/\nInfluence_Tactics:_Consensus_or_Social_Proof.\nTh is video shows subjects being infl uenced to face diff erent directions in an\nelevator, even at one point facing toward the back because everyone else is doing it.\nTh ere were four to fi ve participants in the elevator acting as patrons. At set intervals,\nthe participants would all turn to the left, to the right, or face backwards. After a\nfew seconds, a hidden camera would catch the unsuspecting subject complying and\nfacing the same direction, removing a hat, or taking some other action.\nUsing social proof as a social engineer can be a deadly tool. Th is principle can\nbe used to stimulate a person’s compliance with a request by informing him or her\nthat many other individuals, perhaps some who are role models, took the action or\nbehavior you are trying to get this person to do. Social proof can provide a shortcut\n214 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nfor determining how to behave. But at the same time it can make targets vulnerable\nto the manipulations of others who seek to exploit such infl uence.\nSocial proof is most infl uential under two conditions:\n» Uncertainty: When people are unsure and the situation is ambiguous\nthey are more likely to observe the behavior of others and to accept that\nbehavior as correct.\n» Similarity: People are more inclined to follow the lead of others who are\nsimilar to themselves.\nTh ese conditions are where a social engineer can use social proof. Stating or\neven implying that many people before this target have taken a particular action\ncan increase your chances of success.\nIn one social engineering situation where I was stopped by a leery security guard,\nI simply acted confused as to why I was stopped and said, “Yesterday, Jim let me in\nafter checking all my credentials. I just fi gured I was still on record.”\nTh e present security guard, hearing that Jim approved me, allowed me to pass\nwithout question. Social proof won’t always work so easily, but it is a very powerful\nforce.\nTh e principles outlined in this section are some of the deadliest infl uence tactics\nused today. Th ese tactics can literally give a social engineer powers to motivate\npeople, move them, and cause them to react in ways that will put them in the social\nengineer’s control.\nRemember that infl uence and the art of persuasion is the process of getting\nsomeone else to want to do, react, think, or believe in the way you want them to.\nCreating this motivation within a target is a powerful force; it is a social engineer’s\nsuperpower. Th e principles outlined in this chapter can make that superpower a\nreality, but not without consequence and lots of work.\nWhat do I mean by that? I have often found that after I practice a certain skill and\nbecome profi cient at it, “turning it off ” is very hard. Th is trait may sound attractive,\nbut being cautious when it comes to who you are infl uencing, especially as a social\nengineer, is a good idea. To ingrain these skills into your personality, use them for\nhelping others. For example, when you start to practice reading microexpressions\nand even using them to manipulate a target, the initial response might be to think\nyou have some mystical power that allows you to almost read minds. Th is is where\ncaution is wise. Practice the skill and work toward perfecting it, but don’t assume\nyou know it all.",
    "question": "How can social engineers effectively use the principles of reciprocity, scarcity, authority, commitment and consistency, and liking to influence and manipulate individuals during their audits?",
    "summary": "The text discusses key principles of influence in social engineering, including concessions, scarcity, authority, commitment and consistency, and liking. It explains how these techniques can be used to manipulate people's behavior by creating urgency, leveraging perceived authority, encouraging consistency in actions, and building rapport through likability. It also highlights the importance of using social proof to influence others, as people tend to follow the actions of others, especially when they are uncertain or similar to themselves. The text emphasizes that for these tactics to work, they must be believable and that social engineers must balance their approach to avoid losing credibility."

    "text": "INFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 215\nIf you can infl uence someone to stop smoking, to start working out, or to be\nhealthier, then you will learn to tap into these skills at will to benefi t others, and\nusing them in your social engineering practice is not a farfetched idea.\nMany of these skills require you to actually be interested in people, care about\nthem, and empathize with them. If these are not natural abilities for you, then you\nmust work hard to obtain those skills. I urge you to take that time, because the skills\nin the preceding section can lead you to being a grand master social engineer.\nImagine you could alter what you think to the extent that gaining these skills\ncould be easier. Imagine now, too, if you could alter the thinking of your targets so\nwhat they experience is exactly what you want them to experience. Literally alter-\ning the reality of those you interact with, including yourself, is the next topic, and\nit will just blow you away.\nAltering Reality: Framing\nFraming has been defi ned as information and experiences in life that alter the way\none reacts to the decisions one must make. From a non–social engineer point of\nview, framing is your own personal experiences and the experiences of others that\nyou allow into your conscious mind to alter the way you make decisions.\nGrocery stores use framing by putting “75% lean” on a package of ground meat as\nopposed to “25% fat.” Th ese terms mean the same thing (both have 25% fat content)\nbut one sounds healthier and is more appealing to the buyer, and that is why stores\nuse 75% lean as opposed to labeling the actual fat content.\nTh e preceding example is simple, but it is also one that helps to show the power\nof framing. Simply presenting the facts in a diff erent way can make something seem\ngood that would normally be considered bad.\nTh e following sections look at a few areas where framing is often used so you\ncan see how powerful it is.\nPolitics\nFraming has long been used in politics. Simply the way campaigns or messages are\nworded can make a huge diff erence in the way the public perceives a message.\nConsider, for example, George Lakoff , a professional cognitive linguist. In an\ninteresting observation on framing in politics, he states the diff erence in how peo-\nple perceive the use of the phrases “Counterterrorism as law enforcement” versus\n216 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n“Counterterrorism as war.” When the 9/11 attacks occurred, Colin Powell argued\nthat they should be treated as crimes. When the public demanded more action and\nstricter policies, then President Bush announced the “War on Terror” campaign.\nAnother example is the Social Security program in the United States. Th e name\nimplies that this program can be relied upon to provide security for the future.\nYet another example is the diff erence in the terms bailout versus economic stimu-\nlus. Bailout met with lots of opposition because it can paint a word picture of bail-\ning water out of a sinking boat. But economic stimulus paints the mental picture of\nhelping the economy by stimulating the economy. Both programs did almost the\nsame thing, but simple wording made the latter term more acceptable.\nJudith Butler, Berkeley professor and author of the critically acclaimed book\nFrames of War, wrote about how framing is used especially in western cultures\nwhen it comes to political agendas and war. In her book she explores the media’s\nportrayal of state violence:\nThis portrayal has saturated our understanding of human life, and\nhas led to the exploitation and abandonment of whole peoples, who\nare cast as existential threats rather than as living populations in\nneed of protection. These people are framed as already lost, to impris-\nonment, unemployment, and starvation, and can easily be dismissed.\nIn the twisted logic that rationalizes their deaths, the loss of such\npopulations is deemed necessary to protect the lives of “the living.”\nTh ese are just a few examples where framing is used in politics.\nUsing Framing in Everyday Life\nTh e term frame of reference is defi ned as a set of ideas, conditions, or assumptions\nthat determine how something will be approached, perceived, or understood. Th is\ndefi nition can be helpful in understanding how framing is used.\nAnything that can alter people’s perceptions or the way they make decisions\ncan be called framing. A friend tells you that last week she went to town and took a\ncertain route that was backed up for 10 miles due to some construction. You might\nthen take a longer route to avoid the potential delay, even though the news your\nfriend shared is more than one week old.\nOur minds are designed to not like “clutter” or chaos. When presented with\nthings that are cluttered our brains will try to make order out of them. One inter-\nesting example of this is found in Figure 6-3.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 217\nFigure 6-3 Can you alter your reality frame\nto change what you see?\nIn your present frame, what is the background and what is the foreground? Your\nminds will insist on fi nding familiar patterns in things. We do it in clouds, space,\nand inanimate objects. Humans also tend to see faces in these things.\nIn Figure 6-3 can you alter your frame and change what is the image and what is\nthe background? Try by focusing on the opposite of what you noticed fi rst.\nAnother very interesting example of how human brains fi nd order in chaos can be\nillustrated in an e-mail that circulated over the last few years that looked like this:\nO lny srmat poelpe can raed tihs.\nI cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was\nrdanieg.

Amzanig huh? yaeh and I awlyas tghuhot slpeling was\nipmorantt! if you can raed tihs psas it on !!\n218 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nI am not sure whether this is actually Cambridge research, but the interest-\ning part in that forwarded e-mail is how many of us who use English as our main\nlanguage or are very profi cient in reading English are probably able to read that\nparagraph without much eff ort, because our brains are very effi cient at making\norder out of chaos.\nMany times the framing is more subliminal. Companies use this in marketing in\nhopes that the subliminal messages will alter the target’s perception of their product.\nMany times companies will use subtle measures of framing to plant an idea.\nFor example, Figure 6-4 shows something you probably have seen many\ntimes.\nFigure 6-4 Can you spot the frame?\nAfter I show you this, you will never see the FedEx logo the same way again—\nthere is an arrow in the FedEx logo. In an interview with the creator of the logo,\nhe said he embedded the arrow in the logo to plant an idea about FedEx’s ser-\nvices. It is there to communicate movement, speed, and the dynamic nature of the\ncompany.\nDid you fi nd it yet? Look at Figure 6-4 where I outlined and circled the arrow.\nFigure 6-5 The arrow indicates quality\nservice that is always moving.\nFedEx is not the only company that utilizes framing. For decades companies\nhave been embedding messages into logos in an eff ort to frame the thinking of the\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 219\nviewer to remember, think, and view their company in the way they want. Th e next\nfew fi gures show more examples.\nDid you ever notice Amazon’s logo for its embedded framing message (see\nFigure 6-6)?\nFigure 6-6 Do you see the smiling\nhappy customer?\nAmazon has two framed messages in its logo. One is the happiness you will feel\nas a customer, represented by the smile in the image, but the smile is also an arrow.\nTh at arrow points from A to Z, indicating the Amazon has everything from both\npoints and in between.\nAnother great example is the Tostitos logo. Th is is a very social logo, as you can\nsee in Figure 6-7.\nFigure 6-7 Does this logo make you want\nto share a chip with someone?\nTh e two T’s in the middle are people sharing a chip over a bowl of salsa. In 2004,\nTostitos issued a press release that said, “Tostitos plays a role as a ‘social snack,’\nhelping to create connections between friends and families, whether it’s at a party,\nduring the ‘big game,’ or at simple everyday get-togethers. Th e new logo brings to\nlife this idea of making connections.”\n220 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh ese examples are just a small subset of how framing is used in marketing.\nFraming is not all about images; mostly it is about the value that the target perceives.\nTh e perception that the target has of an item can increase or decrease its value. Take\nan expensive clothing store—when you walk in everything is hung neatly, pressed,\nand perfect. Th e perception can be that the clothing is worth the exorbitant amount\nof the price tag. Yet, if you were to take one of the ties, shirts, or other pieces of\nclothing off the rack; bring it to a discount store; and throw it into a large bin full of\nother clothes marked, “Discount 75% off ” your perception of the value of that item\nof clothing would go way down.\nMarketing gurus play off this phenomenon in an eff ort to frame the public’s\nperception of value. Many companies have been successful at framing to such an\nextent that people actually have coined phrases to create a whole genre of words\nto describe products.\nFor example, everyone has probably said, “Will you make a Xerox of that?” even\nif the machine is not a Xerox but another brand. Xerox is the brand name, not the\ntype of machine.\nA more recent example is no matter what search engine you use, people often\nsay, “Did you Google it?” because Google has become synonymous with searching\non the Web. And people say, “Hand me a Kleenex please,” when really they want\na tissue.\nOthers that you might not even be aware were brand names (unless you are of\nthe generation in which they were introduced) include:\n» Aspirin is a trademarked product of Bayer.\n» Th ermos is a product name of Th ermos GmbH Company.\n» Band-Aid is a trademark of Johnson & Johnson.\n» Frisbee was a trademark of Wham-O.\nAll of those names became so popular that people’s frame of reference even-\ntually encompassed any product similar to it. I never take aspirin—I usually use\nanother brand—but I will always ask for “two aspirin,” be given the brand I use,\nand be happy.\nVolumes of information exist about framing, but boiling down this information\nto some main principles you can use as a social engineer is necessary. Th e preced-\ning information set a very detailed stage for what framing is and how it is used in\ndiff erent areas of life. Before moving to the social engineering arena, take a look at\nthe diff erent types of framing alignments.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 221\nFour Types of Frame Alignment\nTwo researchers, David Snow from the University of Arizona and Robert Benford from\nthe University of Nebraska, wrote a paper entitled, “Clarifying the Relationship Between\nFraming and Ideology in the Study of Social Movements” (www.social-engineer\n.org/resources/book/SNOW_BED.pdf).\nSnow and Benford argue that when individual frames become linked in congru-\nency and complementariness, that frame alignment occurs, producing frame reso-\nnance, which is key to the process of a group transitioning from one frame to another.\nSnow and Benford then outline four conditions that aff ect framing eff orts:\n» “Th e robustness, completeness, and thoroughness of the framing\neff ort”: Snow and Benford identifi ed three core framing tasks, and the\ndegree to which these tasks are attended to will determine how much\neach participant gets involved.\nThe three steps are:\n1. Diagnose the frame for problems.\n2. Analyze it for solutions.\n3. If successful, a call to action.\nThe more effort put into the frame the better chance the person has\nto call those he is framing into action.\n» “Th e relationship between the proposed frame and the larger belief\nsystem”: People tend to discount frames or proposed frames if a link\ndoes not exist to a core belief or a value of their belief system.\nTrying to convince a person who holds a belief that eating meat is\ncruelty to animals to go to the steak place down the road that has a great\nspecial will certainly fail. The frame must fall with the core of a person’s\nbeliefs to be successful (unless your goal is to use a frame to change his or\nher core beliefs); it is imperative to success.\nA large-scale framing change attempt was made through the contro-\nversial anti-smoking commercials where volunteers pile up body bags in\nfront of a tobacco industry building’s front door. The body bags repre-\nsent how many people die every minute, hour, or day from smoking. The\nhope is to alter the frame of those who support smoking to think about\nthe death toll for those who smoke.\n222 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» “Relevance of the frame to the realities of the participants”: Th e\nframe must be relevant to the person (target). It must be creditable and\ntestable as it relates to the target’s experience.\nYou can’t expect to use a marketing frame that will encourage people\nto take a luxury cruise in a land where people cannot afford food for the\nday. No matter how good you are at using framing in marketing, it just\nwould fail. For the frame to align, it must not just be relevant but must\nalso be provable in order to hold value, even if that proof is just in the\nmind of the target.\nFor example, in 2007 a very popular and trusted news source, Insight\nMagazine (which is owned by the same company as The Washington\nTimes) reported that then-presidential candidate Obama had attended an\nall-Muslim school that was known for teaching a very radical and funda-\nmental form of Islam. When this news report was released many believed\nit right away—why? It fit into the frame of their reality, it seemed cred-\nible, and it came from a “trusted” source.\nCNN, another reputable source for news, sent out investigators, dis-\ncovered that story was false, and reported its findings.\nThis is a good example of altering people’s frames on a matter using\na very trusted source for “truth”—news media. People who wanted to\nbelieve that Obama was a radical Muslim ran with that story, and the\nnews went wild. When research revealed the story to be false, many\npeople’s thinking was altered again.\n» “Cycles of protest; the point at which the frame emerges on the\ntimeline of the current era and existing preoccupations with social\nchange”: What is happening in the world can aff ect a social frame. Th ink\nback a few years ago; if the idea of full body X-ray scans were proposed\nto companies in the U.S. or other Western cultures, the idea would have\nbeen thrown to the wind.\nActivists for privacy would have fought against the idea and won,\nsimply by using the idea of someone being able to see your private areas\nand potentially saving that picture to mock or sexually harass you. This\nargument would have outweighed the sales efforts of the creators of the\nmachines. Yet, after the attacks in America on September 11 and the\nsubsequent rise of terrorist activity, those machines are being installed at\nairports around the globe despite the cries by activists, even arguing with\nthe power of child pornography laws on their side.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 223\nWhy? The social frame of how to remain safe has been altered,\nallowing a new breed of decision to enter.\nSnow and Benford propose that when proper frames are constructed\nas described in these four points, large-scale changes in society such as\nthose necessary for social movement can be achieved through frame align-\nment. Their studies focus on society as a whole, but these same principles\nare effective when dealing on a smaller scale or even one-to-one.\nTh e preceding discussion is just the process to frame alignment; actually four\ndiff erent types of alignment can occur after these four conditions are met. Although\nmany of these aspects are geared towards framing groups as a whole, the following\nsections discuss these four framing alignments on a personal level that will show\nhow you can use them on a smaller scale both as a social engineer and/or just as\na person wanting to align frames with others. Imagine trying to align your goal\nof entry to a building with the frame of the security guard designed to stop you.\nBringing his frame into alignment with your pretext can ensure success.\nOne thing to remember about frames is that they are never constructed from\nscratch. Frames are always drawn on already-existing cultural codes that involve\nthe core of a person’s beliefs and experiences. Knowing this will aff ect how you use\nframing.\nFrame Bridging\nTh e Cathie Marsh Centre for Census and Survey Information defi nes frame bridging\nas the linkage of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected\nframes regarding a particular topic.\nBridging is not about tricking people into believing your frame as much as your\nunderstanding their frame so deeply that you fi nd the connecting link. You then\nuse that connecting link to bring a target into your frame.\nTh e situation could be that you want to gain access to an area, building, or piece\nof information. Your frame is that you want that to happen. Th e frame of the person\nyou are approaching is not necessarily to stop you; he may not even know what you\nare going to attempt. If you were to approach the situation in that frame you may\nalert him to a problem and thereby shut down your chances.\nBy understanding the target’s job, role, and mental outlook you can understand\nhis frame of mind and maybe fi nd a link that will make his transition into your\nframe much easier.\nWhat is your pretext? How would the person you are about to approach treat\na person in your pretext? A good social engineer must understand this to be\n224 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nsuccessful. Th e “gatekeeper” will treat a sales guy diff erently from the soda deliv-\nery guy. Understanding the frame of the target means knowing how he will treat\nyou—not you as a social engineer, but you as the pretext.\nA more personal example may be to think of how you want others to view you—\nmaybe as cool, “together,” intelligent, or confi dent. A professor wants to appear\nsmart. A manager wants to appear in control. An athlete wants to appear calm and\nstrong. A comedian wants the audience to view her as funny. All of these are frames\nthat a person wants others to be in alignment with.\nIn the comedian’s case, what if there is a heckler—a person who doesn’t see her as\ncool, funny, intelligent, or confi dent? Because of the heckler’s frame they are angry,\nnot happy, put off , or just not interested? If the comedian persists in his frame he\nmay convert some people around him, but until he delves deep and try to understand\nwhere someone is coming from he will not be able to align their two frames and\nbring that person into his frame. Th e comedian who can handle a heckler is able to\nput aside her fears about her frame and use the heckler to her advantage.\nTh e frame bridging alignment technique can be one of the most powerful used\nby a social engineer, but involves some preparation to make sure you get it right.\nA social engineer can utilize this particular form of frame alignment by helping a\ntarget bridge the gap of what they see and what they need to believe through a proper\npretext. Again, recall the example of trying to gain access to the building as a tech\nsupport rep. Your dress, tools, and language must match the frame that the target\nexpects of a support rep. If they do, the bridge is created and alignment occurs.\nFrame Amplification\nFrame amplifi cation, according to Snow, refers to “the clarifi cation and invigoration\nof an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem, or set of events.”\nIn other words, you will amplify, or focus on, the values or beliefs of the target. By\nfocusing on those values you can fi nd an area that will align your two frames, or at\nleast drive the target to think there is alignment.\nTh is form of alignment has been labeled as the most basic of the four because it is\nmore of a maintenance method. It involves the accenting, augmenting, or punctuat-\ning of an event as being more important than others, which allows for this event to\nbe linked with other events with greater ease.\nAn example of frame amplifi cation can be revealed if we do further research into\nthe earlier example about the full-body X-ray scanners. Th e scanners are being sold\nnow as deterrents for terrorists. Th e frame that they are being sold under is how\nthe recent terrorist activity caused a need for products like these, and here they\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 225\nare to fulfi ll that need. Yet research into these devices shows they were being built,\nmarketed, and rejected long before the attacks of 9/11 and other recent attacks.\nUsing the events of 9/11 combined with the fear of fl ying many people have due\nto those attacks enables the scanner companies to link their frame with the frame\nof fear many people have, and thereby gain support for implementing these devices\nin airports around the globe.\nOne of the other strengths of frame amplifi cation is that it can be successfully\nused to blur the frame and cause people with a certain belief to distance themselves\nfrom that belief. For example, many who believed in privacy and the freedom to\nchoose how to be screened have been brought into a diff erent frame by the x-ray\nscanner manufacturers focusing on certain aspects of other screening methods\nbeing unsafe or incomplete, and to prove their point they bring out stories like “the\nunderwear bomber.” Such tactics amplify their frame that the new x-ray scanners\nare better and safer, using widely held beliefs regarding the lack of security of other\nmethods.\nA social engineer can utilize this alignment technique in a few diff erent ways. For\ninstance, a social engineer may want to convince a security guard to give him access\nto an onsite dumpster area. Th e pretext of working for a waste disposal contractor is\ngood and it very well may work alone, but it would work even better if you presented\nthe idea that there is damage to one of the dumpsters, which represents a security\nliability for the company. Amplifying that frame can bring you to an alignment with\nthe security guard that the best solution is allowing you onsite to check it out.\nFrame Extension\n“Frame extensions are a movement’s eff ort to incorporate participants by extending\nthe boundaries of the proposed frame to encompass the views, interests, and, more\nimportantly, the sentiments of a group.” In other words, by extending your frame’s\nboundaries to encompass other subjects or interests of your target, you can bring\nthem into alignment.\nFor example, the possibility exists that groups who support environmental or\n“green” initiatives will extend their frame to antinuclear movements, stating they\nare under the umbrella of a being concerned about the environmental risks.\nHowever, a risk with using frame extensions is they can weaken the stance on\nthe original frame and a certain level of appeal can be lost. Th is can be done by\nincluding too many frame extensions into a certain frame, eventually diluting the\nmain frame and causing interest to be lost.\n226 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nEven on a personal level, simple is best. When using this frame alignment tactic,\nkeep it simple and easy to follow. Don’t make the connecting web so convoluted you\nlose the interest of the target.\nA social engineer may utilize this frame alignment technique through the elicita-\ntion skills discussed in Chapter 3. When a social engineer approaches a target, she\ncan gather information about the target or their company by not acting interested\nin that but utilizing chit-chat at a party, or with a pretext as a reporter. Th is will\ngive the social engineer the “right” to ask for information that they would normally\nhave to work very hard to get.\nFrame Transformation\n“Frame transformation is a process required when the proposed frames may not\nresonate with, and on occasion may even appear antithetical to, conventional life-\nstyles or rituals and extant interpretive frames.” In other words, a social engineer\noff ers new arguments that point to why their frame is better in an eff ort to transform\nthe thoughts or beliefs of a target from where they are to where the social engineer\nwants them to be.\nWhen a frame transformation occurs, new values and new understandings are\nrequired to keep people involved and keep their support. Th is type of transformation\nwas done on a large social level in the 1970s where the conservative movement was\nreframed or transformed into a more progressive environmentalist movement.\nOn a smaller, more personal scale, frame transformations occur every day\nthrough religious conversion, in which a person’s frame or whole belief system is\naltered, changed, and transformed to be aligned with a new frame of thought, that\nof the new religion.\nTransforming someone’s frame is not easy; it is one of the most complicated\nalignment tactics to put into practice because it can take:\n» Time: Changing someone’s whole belief structure is not a quick process\nand can take the usage of other alignment techniques and lots of time to\nmake it work.\n» Eff ort: Knowing where the target is coming from and where you want\nhim to be are just the initial steps. What will be his objections and mental\nblocks? Finding out these things will take some work.\n» Education: Knowledge is power. You must help the target understand\nthe new frame you want him to “convert” to.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 227\n» Logic: Th e education must be logical and not all emotion. Th e target\nmust be able to reason and rationalize the action he is about to take. Th e\nonly way he can do that is with logic.\n» Deep emotional ties: Knowledge is what prepares a person for action,\nlogic convinces him the action is good to take, but emotion is what\nmakes the action happen. If you are emotional about your “cause” the\ntarget will feel that emotion. Just make sure the emotion you are express-\ning and feeling matches the pretext. If your pretext is a guidance coun-\nselor and you come in like a cheerleader you will off set the target’s ability\nto align.\nBeing able to align others to your frame and align yourself with theirs can give\npeople incentive to do the things you ask. Although using any of the four framing\nmethods is powerful, a social engineer who is successful in frame transformation\nhas endless power.\nRead on to fi nd out how to apply these framing techniques as a social engineer.\nUsing Framing as a Social Engineer\nTh roughout this section I mentioned many ways a social engineer might use framing\nas a technique. Some of these methods are so powerful that perfecting them can\nturn you into a master infl uencer.\nTo truly use framing as a social engineer you must understand four things about\nframing. Th ese four things will help you to understand clearly how framing works\nand how to use it as a social engineer.\nRemember what a frame is. A frame is a conceptual structure that our minds use\nin thinking. Th is is a vital piece of information because your goal is either to create\na new frame, align with a person’s frame, or bring the target into your frame.\nOne of those three goals needs to be outlined with the following four rules in\norder to master framing as a social engineer.\nRule 1: Everything You Say Will Evoke a Frame\nPeople’s minds work by picturing things. Th is natural fact cannot be altered, but\nyou can use it to your advantage.\nIf I start to talk to you about your boss, your mind will picture him. If I paint a\npicture with words about how he was outside on the cell phone and he was angry,\nyour mind will start to picture his angry face, body language, and words. You will not\nbe able to control this and that mental frame will cause emotions and reactions.\n228 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nPainting a picture with words is a powerful way to use framing. By choosing\nyour words carefully you can cause a target’s mind to picture things you want him\nto picture and start moving him to a frame you want.\nHave you ever heard someone who you thought was a great storyteller? Why?\nWhat made her great? She was able to paint a mental picture, make you see things\nin your mind, which intrigues you and gets you involved. Th is skill is very important\nfor a social engineer. It doesn’t mean you talk as if you are telling a great story all\nthe time, but you want to keep in mind the words you choose because those words\nhold the power to paint pictures in the minds of the targets.\nHere is a simple example: I can tell you that I had spaghetti for dinner last\nnight. If you are not a foodie or not Italian, maybe the last time you had spaghetti\nit wasn’t that pleasurable. Your mental frame is not that strong and you might be\nturned off .\nWhat if I told you that last night my wife made a sauce of vine-ripened tomatoes\nand basil she grew in the garden? It also had chunks of fresh garlic and oregano in\nit, as well as a hint of red wine fl avors. She served it over a plate of perfectly cooked\nspaghetti noodles and with homemade garlic bread.\nWhether or not you are a pasta fan, you are picturing a restaurant-quality dish.\nTh is is how you should plan your words with your targets. Th ey should be descrip-\ntive, robust, and full of pictures. Yet the caution is not to be overly theatrical as a\nsocial engineer. Your goal should be to build a picture with your words, not to draw\nattention to yourself or your delivery.\nRule 2: Words That Are Defined Within a Frame Evoke the Mental Frame\nYou don’t have to use the exact words to make a person picture the frame you want.\nFor example, what do you think of when you read the following sentence?\n“I saw the insect struggle to get free from the web, but he could not. Moments\nlater he was wrapped up in a cocoon and saved for dinner.”\nNotice, I didn’t have to mention a spider to make you think of a spider. If I want\nto frame you into thinking about a spider, I can do it without having to mention the\nword spider. Th is powerful rule of infl uence and framing gives a social engineer the\nability to control the target’s thoughts using indirect speech.\nToastmasters, the international organization focused on people’s speaking abili-\nties, teaches its members to move people with their speech by getting their audience’s\nemotions involved. Delivering a story that causes the target to picture the frame\nyou want while involving them emotionally will solidify your standing in leading\nthat conversation.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 229\nAgain, using this method of framing will take planning. A powerful aspect to this\nframe rule is that while a target’s brain is processing the information you are feeding\nit and generating the mental pictures you are painting, there is a time when you can\nplant thoughts or ideas. Unlike where I painted a direct picture of a beautiful pasta\ndish, this rule allows the target the freedom to picture something else.\nI could have ended my earlier spaghetti dinner story with, “My wife then served\nit on a plate of perfectly cooked pasta. What kind of pasta? I am not telling you,\nyou have to picture it,” and when your brain starts to picture it then I can say, “As I\ntwirled it on my fork, the sauce was so thick and perfect it clung to each noodle.”\nTh is description paints the mental picture of spaghetti. What other pasta do you\ntwirl? (I know there are others, but you get the point.)\nRule 3: Negating the Frame\nIf I tell you to not picture a spider in a web, your brain has to picture the spider fi rst\nto tell yourself to not picture it.\nTh is technique of negating the frame is powerful. Telling a target to be careful,\nwatch out, or be cautious about something automatically puts them in the frame\nyou may want. Th is technique is often used by professional social engineers. In one\ninterview I did with a panel of social engineers, everyone agreed that this technique\nworks great.\nDuring one audit, I dropped a few USB keys that were laden with malicious code\nthat I wanted someone in the company to run without thinking. I approached one\nof the employees who I had gained the trust of and said, “John, I heard a memo was\nissued to be on the lookout for a few USB keys that have been dropped. Th ey are\nlooking for them now.”\nIt just so happens that you are in there as a janitor and you dropped the USB\nkeys laden with malicious fi les, and now by telling people to look out for them, you\nare in essence planting the seed for them to do your bidding. Th is kind of a phrase\nnegates the worry they may feel when fi nding a rogue USB key and cause them to\nplug it in to see whose it is.\nRule 4: Causing the Target to Think About the Frame\nReinforces That Frame\nEvery time the brain focuses or thinks about something it is reinforced. Th e more\nyou can make the target think about or picture the frame you want him in, the\neasier it will be to reinforce and move him to that frame.\n230 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nLook back at Chapter 2 on communication modeling and analyze how the mes-\nsages a social engineer will develop can have amazing eff ects on your targets.\nI was once traveling in India. I don’t remember the exact incident in the news,\nbut all I know is that President George W. Bush had lost favor with people in Europe.\nI was fl ipping through the news stations and saw how people in certain European\ncountries where hanging dolls that looked like George W. Bush in the streets. After\nwrapping American fl ags around the dolls they were lighting them on fi re.\nIt was a shocking scene and while I was on the phone with my wife that evening\nI said, “Wow that news story on what’s happening in Europe is crazy, huh?”\nShe hadn’t heard anything about it. Why? News media and news stations are\nmasters when it comes to framing and manipulation.\nA social engineer can learn a lot from looking at how media utilizes this skill.\nBy using omissions, or leaving out details of a story or the whole story itself, the\nmedia can lead people to a conclusion that seems like their own, but really is the\nmedia’s.\nSocial engineers can do that, too. By omitting certain details and only “leaking”\ndetails that they want leaked, they can create the frame that they want the target\nto think or feel.\nLabeling is another tactic used by the media. When they want to frame some-\nthing positive they may say things like, “the strong defense of…” or “our healthy\neconomy.” Th ese phrases paint mental pictures of stability and health that can help\ndraw positive conclusions. Th e same rules can apply for negative frames, too. Labels\nsuch as, “Islamic terrorists” or “conspiracy theories” paint a very negative picture.\nYou can utilize these skills to label things with descriptive words that will bring\na target into the frame you want. Once, approaching a guard booth that I wanted\nto gain access to, I walked right through as if I belonged. I was instantly stopped\nabruptly. I looked at the guard in shock and apologetically I used a phrase like, “Oh,\nyesterday that extremely helpful security guard, Tom, checked out all my creds and\nlet me pass. Th at is why I assumed I was still on the list.”\nLabeling the previous guard as “extremely helpful” automatically puts the present\nguard in a frame I want. If he wants to receive such a prestigious label, he better be\nas “extremely helpful” as Tom was.\nFraming is eff ective because it bends the truth but not so much that it becomes\nfalse, so it remains believable. A social engineer can create a desired impression\nwithout departing too far from the appearance of objectivity.\nI read a white paper called “Status Quo Framing Increases Support for Torture,”\nwritten by Christian Crandall, Scott Eidelman, Linda Skitka, and Scott Morgan,\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 231\nall researchers from diff erent universities. In the white paper they supplied a very\ninteresting data set that intrigued me on this topic. In the U.S. it seems many people\nare against the use of torture in wartime as a tactic for gaining intelligence infor-\nmation. Th e purpose of this study was to see whether the researchers could get a\nsubset of people to agree that torture is less disagreeable by framing the message\ndiff erently.\nTh ey took a sample group of roughly 486 people and asked them to read two\nparagraphs.\nTh e fi rst one read:\nThe use of stress by U.S. forces when questioning suspects in the\nMiddle East is in the news. This kind of stress interview is new;\naccording to some reports, it is the first time it has been widely used\nby the U.S. military. American forces have used many different\nmethods, including strapping detainees to a board and dunking\nthem underwater, stuffing detainees face-first into a sleeping bag,\nand long periods of hanging detainees by ropes in painful positions.\nDetainees are also kept awake and alone for days at a time.\nTh is paragraph paints the thought that these are new techniques being employed\nby the U.S. Government to obtain data.\nTh e second paragraph read:\nThe use of stress by U.S. forces when questioning suspects in the\nMiddle East is in the news. This kind of stress interview is not new;\naccording to some reports, it has been used for more than 40 years\nby the U.S. military. American forces have used many different\nmethods, including strapping detainees to a board and dunking\nthem underwater, stuffing detainees face-first into a sleeping bag,\nand long periods of hanging detainees by ropes in painful positions.\nDetainees are also kept awake and alone for days at a time.\nTh e status quo version of the paragraph was identical, except that the second\nsentence in the paragraph was replaced with “Th is kind of stress interview is not\nnew; according to some reports, it has been used for more than 40 years by the\nU.S. military.”\nWhat were the results in just changing one frame—a frame that these are brand-\nnew methods or that these are tried-and-tested methods that have been used for\ndecades?\n232 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh e paper describes the researchers’ measures. Seven items formed the basic set\nof dependent variables. Th ese items corresponded to a seven-point “button” scale,\nwith the point labels of very much disagree, moderately disagree, slightly disagree,\nuncertain, slightly agree, moderately agree, and very much agree. All items were\nreverse scored so that higher scores refl ected greater agreement with each item.\nTh e conclusion? “Th e status quo manipulation had an eff ect on overall evaluation\nof torture—when described as a long-standing rather than new practice, torture was\nevaluated more positively; [m]aking torture appear to be the status quo for interroga-\ntions increased individual support and justifi cations for using it as a tactic.”\nBy changing just one little part of the frame the researchers were able to bring\na sizeable group of people into alignment and make them agree (for the most part)\nthat torture can be an acceptable policy.\nTh at paper’s remarks continued, “Th ey can apply across many, many domains,\nand can aff ect judgment, decision making, aesthetics, and policy preferences,” con-\ncluding with, “relatively modest changes in the way ethical choices and value dilem-\nmas are presented, framed, or put in context can have profound eff ect on political\nchoice and policy.”\nTh is experiment proves how powerful framing is because it can change even core\nbeliefs, judgments, and decisions that people may have had for years. As a social\nengineer that is not even the goal most of the time. You are not trying to convert\npeople; you’re just trying to get them to take an action that with a little thought they\nwould reason is not that good to take.\nApplying the four framing rules and doing a lot of planning can make framing\na devastating force to be reckoned with, which is why, unfortunately, malicious\nsocial engineers use this technique every day. In the U.S. and “westernized cultures,”\nespecially, people are trained to accept being framed, to accept being told what to\nthink and how to think it.\nIf I told you 15 years ago that almost every program on television would be about\nwatching real people do real things, you might have laughed at me. Why? Because\nwatching shows like that sounded boring and silly. Yet in 2006, the Los Angeles Times\nstated that the number of reality TV programs jumped up 128% (http://articles\n.latimes.com/2010/mar/31/business/la-fi-ct-onlocation31-2010mar31), and\nit hasn’t slowed down much since then, and it’s because watching them is what’s new\nand hip, and we are told that watching them is good and fun, and everyone does it.\nTh ese shows are an example of how one thing can be made to look good that most\npeople would have considered silly just a few years earlier.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 233\nFraming is defi nitely an art form that when mixed with the science of communi-\ncation and infl uence can become a formidable force on a personal level in the hands\nof a skilled social engineer, through presenting information in a way that can make\naligning with the social engineer “easy” for the target, can make him take action\nthat will not leave him feeling guilty, and alter his perception of reality.\nFraming and infl uence are key parts of social engineering, although another\nskill is often associated with the “dark corners” of social engineering. Th e book’s\nintroduction mentioned peering into these corners; the following section presents\nthe information that will alter the way you look at infl uence.\nManipulation: Controlling Your Target\nManipulation is considered by many to be a very dark topic, a topic that creates a\nsense of fear because of the way it is often portrayed.\nTaking a look at a few defi nitions found on the Internet may help to explain:\n» “exerting shrewd or devious infl uence especially for one’s own advantage”\n» “infl uence or control shrewdly or deviously”\n» “control (others or oneself) or infl uence skillfully, usually to one’s\nadvantage”\nYou can clearly see why many social engineers drool over this topic. Can you\nimagine being able to use your skills to control or influence someone to your\nadvantage?\nFrom something as dark as brainwashing to the subtle hints of a salesperson,\nmanipulation tactics are something every social engineer should study and perfect.\nTh e aim of manipulation is to overcome the critical thinking and free will of their\ntarget. When the target loses his ability to make a decision based on informed\nprocesses, they can be fed the ideas, values, attitudes, or reasonings of the one\nmanipulating them.\nManipulation is used in six ways that hold true whether the topic is brainwash-\ning or something less insidious. I will quickly go through each one before we get\ninto this very deep section.\n» Increasing the suggestibility of your target. At its most extreme, sleep\nor food deprivation increases a target’s suggestibility. On the lighter side,\nsubtle hints that build in intensity over time to make your target more\nsuggestible.\n234 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Gaining control over the target’s environment. Th is technique can\ninvolve everything from controlling the type and quantity of information\nto which a target has access to much subtler things like gaining access\nto a target’s social media websites. In a social engineering context, having\naccess to social media allows you to view your target’s communications\nas well as exert control over the information he receives.\n» Creating doubt. Destabilizing and undermining your target’s belief sys-\ntem can go a long way toward manipulating your target to take an action\nyou want. From a social engineering viewpoint, this must be done subtly.\nYou can’t just barge in and start degrading your target; instead, question-\ning the rules they follow, their job, or their beliefs can aff ect the target’s\nability to make rational decisions.\n» Creating a sense of powerlessness. Th is truly malicious technique is\nused in wartime interrogations to make a target feel a lack of confi dence\nin their convictions. A social engineer can utilize this tactic by taking\naway the target’s agency by presenting the “facts” you received from\nsomeone with authority, thus creating a powerless feeling.\n» Creating strong emotional responses in the target. Strong emotional\nresponses include everything from doubt to guilt to humiliation and\nmore. If the feelings are intense enough, they can cause the target to alter\ntheir whole belief system. A social engineer must be careful not to create\ndamaging negative emotions, but using tactics that create an emotional\nresponse based on fear of loss or punishment can prove benefi cial to your\nSE goal.\n» Heavy intimidation. Fear of physical pain or other dire circumstances\ncan be used to make a target crack under pressure. Again, most social\nengineers will not go this route unless they are using corporate espionage\nas a tactic, but in normal social engineering, this tactic utilizes perceived\nauthority to build strong fear and feelings of potential loss.\nMost times, however, manipulation is not so extreme. On its very basic level,\nimagine you’re in a crowded room and someone calls out your name. What is\nyour reaction? Usually it is to turn around or respond with a “Yes?” You have been\nmanipulated, but not necessarily in a bad way.\nOn a psychological level, being manipulated is even more profound. Notice what\nhappens to make that preceding interaction happen: Your brain hears your name,\nand you automatically formulate an answer (“Yes?”). Th e connection between that\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 235\nanswer and your vocal response is very short. Even if you made no vocal response\nor if the name-calling is not targeted to you personally, if a question is asked your\nmind will formulate an answer.\nJust being in close proximity of two people conversing and overhearing a ques-\ntion will cause your mind to formulate an answer. Th e answer can be an image or\nsound in your mind. If a target overhears two people talking about what someone\nlooks like his mind will form a mental picture. If you hear two people telling a joke\nabout a chicken crossing the road, you may picture the chicken, the road, or the\nwhole scene.\nTh is type of manipulation is just the beginning of what you can do. Another\nmanipulation tactic is that of conditioning.\nPeople can be conditioned to connect certain sounds or actions with feelings\nand emotions. If every time something positive is mentioned a person hears a pen\nclick, after a short time the target can be conditioned to associate a positive feeling\nwith this sound.\nOne of the most classic examples of conditioning was Ivan Pavlov and what we\ncall Pavlov’s dog, which was discussed in Chapter 5. Th e question then becomes\nwhether you can use this type of conditioning on people. Although making targets\nsalivate is not on most social engineers’ priority list (although it would be humor-\nous), are there ways to condition a target to react to certain sets of input the way\nyou want them to react?\nTo fi nd the answer, read the following sections, which provide a few examples\nof manipulation in business and marketing to set a foundation for discussion and\nan analysis of how to use manipulation on a personal level.\nTo Recall or Not To Recall\nIn May 2010 Th e Washington Post reported an interesting story (www.washingtonpost\n.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/27/AR2010052705484.html). Th e maker\nof children’s Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl, and Zyrtec, among other liquid over-the-\ncounter medicines, discovered a defective batch of Motrin and didn’t want to per-\nform a recall due to the costs of such an action. What was the company’s answer?\nIt used manipulation. The company hired a slew of contractors to go from\nstore to store and buy back all the Motrin in the store, which would then be\ndestroyed. Unfortunately, its plans were foiled when a contractor dropped a paper\nin one store that outlined the plot, which was then reported to the Federal Drug\nAdministration (FDA).\n236 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nOn a side note, the FDA did make that company recall 136 million bottles in\njust one out of four recalls. Unfortunately, it was too late because 775 cases were\nreported of children and infants who had adverse reactions to this tainted batch,\nwith 37 ending in death. Th e reports are not conclusive whether the deaths were a\nresult of the bad Motrin or a reaction to the Motrin. Th at is not the focus here.\nTh is is a very dark example of manipulation, or at least attempted manipulation.\nTo protect this company’s image it was willing to forgo the proper procedures and\nthe safety of children all over the world. It attempted to manipulate the system and\nin the process people lost their lives. Th e documentation that was dropped in the\nstore discussed how the contractors were under orders to buy the product back and\nnot mention “recall” at any point in time.\nWhen the company was caught it deployed many interesting manipulation tac-\ntics. It defl ected the situation by saying the reason for the action was its experts\ndidn’t think a signifi cant risk existed to children.\nIt followed this statement by a formal apology and the fi ring of six top execu-\ntives. Th en the real manipulation came in. While being questioned, the company\nstated that they were not trying to do a “phantom recall,” as it was being called. Th e\ncompany was testing the alleged damaged batch by having the contractors buy it\nback to be tested. If it was found faulty the company would have taken the proper\nprocedures. Th is company attempted to use a manipulation technique called diver-\nsion, to divert attention from what they were really doing to make it seem better\nthan it was. In addition, it used a cover-up technique to manipulate the thinking\nof those who disagreed with their actions by issuing statements that the company\nwas trying to do testing to determine if there was need for a recall.\nTh is type of manipulation is worth discussing because a diversion tactic can work\non a much smaller scale in a personal setting, too. If you are caught in an area or\nplace you should not be, then having a good cover story that is believable can go a\nlong way toward manipulating the target to allow you safe passage. Diverting the\ntarget’s attention to something other than the problem at hand can give you enough\ntime to redirect his or her concern. For example, if you are caught by a security\nguard, instead of getting nervous, you could simply look at him and say, “Do you\nknow what I am doing here? Did you hear that some USB keys have been lost with\nvery important data on them? It is imperative we fi nd them before everyone comes\nin tomorrow. Do you want to check the bathrooms?”\nMany of you probably never heard about the Motrin recall story, showing that\nthe company did a good job of manipulating (so far) the media and justice system\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 237\nto keep the limelight off of it. Regardless, this situation outlines how diversion and\ncover-up can be used in manipulation.\nAnxiety Cured at Last\nIn 1998 SmithKline Beecham, one the largest pharmaceutical companies in the\nworld, launched an ad campaign designed to “educate” the masses about something\nit called “social anxiety disorder.” It planted 50 press stories and surveys with ques-\ntions like, “Do you have social anxiety disorder?” Th ese quizzes and surveys were\ngeared to “educate” people on this disorder and how to tell whether they suff er\nfrom it.\nLater that year it changed its marketing campaign copy in medical journals from\n“Paxil means peace…in depression, panic disorder, and OCD” to “Show them they\ncan…the fi rst and only approved treatment for social anxiety disorder.” Th is change\ncost the company about $1 million to make.\nIn 1999, a $30 million campaign was launched on print and television announcing\nthat SmithKline Beecham found the cure for social anxiety disorder, and its name\nis Paxil. Using the data from the surveys and quizzes the company bought spots in\nsome of the “hottest” television shows at that time and spouted statistics that 10\nmillion Americans suff er from SAD (social anxiety disorder), and now there is hope.\nBy 2000, Paxil sales accounted for half of the increase in the entire market: Th e\ncompany “became number one in the U.S. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor\nmarket for new retail prescriptions in 2000.’’ In 2001 it won FDA approval to market\nPaxil for both generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.\nTh e 9/11 attacks resulted in a dramatic increase in prescriptions for all antide-\npressants and anxiety drugs. During this time Paxil’s advertising positioned it as\nan answer to the uncontrollable feelings of fear and helplessness that many people\nfelt in the aftermath of the attacks.\nI am not saying that these drugs do not work, or that the company’s motive is\nmalicious, but I fi nd this case particularly interesting in that the manipulation of\nthe market started with education and ended with a massive increase in sales, while\ncreating new disorders along the way.\nTh is type of case-building manipulation is often used in marketing, but is also\nused in politics and even on a personal level, presenting a problem that is terrible,\nbut then presenting “facts” that you have derived as proof of why what you say is\ntrue. On one episode of Th e Real Hustle, Paul Wilson set up a scenario where he\n238 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nhad to extract a famous star they were using in a scam to steal some CDs from a\nstore. Th e store clerk detained the star and waited for the cops to arrive. Paul walked\nin, identifi ed himself as a cop, fl ashed his wallet with nothing more than a picture\nof his kids in it, and was able to “arrest” the star, take the CDs and the money in\nthe cash register as evidence, and leave unquestioned. Th is story is an excellent\nexample of this type of case-building manipulation. Paul had a problem (the thiev-\ning star) and presented himself as the solution (the cop) to the problem. Whatever\nthe scenario, build the case for what a good person you are before presenting your\nrequest, and that case makes the request more palatable to the person you’re trying\nto manipulate.\nYou Can’t Make Me Buy That!\nKmart. I felt like just leaving this section at that, but I think I should explain more.\nKmart developed an idea it called the planogram, which is a diagram that shows\nretailers how to display their products based on colors, sizes, and other criteria to\nmanipulate their customers to want to buy and spend the most.\nPlanograms are designed to create optimal visual and commercial product\nplacement.\nTh e use of these planograms is a form of manipulation because researchers\nhave studied how people shop, think, and buy. Understanding these things helped\nthem develop mechanisms to control the visual input to increase shoppers’ desire\nto buy.\nSoftware, as well as whole companies, are devoted to planning and executing\nthese planograms for the maximum eff ect on keeping shoppers shopping.\nTh ree diff erent layouts are used to manipulate shoppers:\n» Horizontal product placement: To increase a customer’s concentra-\ntion on a certain article, a multiple horizontal placement side by side of\none product is applied. Some retailers found that a minimum placement\nrange between 15 and 30 cm of a single product is necessary to achieve\nan increase in customer attentiveness (see Figure 6-8).\n» Vertical product placement: A diff erent method used is the vertical\nproduct placement. Here one product is placed on more than one shelf\nlevel to achieve 15–30 cm placement space (see Figure 6-9).\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 239\nFigure 6-8 Placing the same or similar items in a\nhorizontal row, as shown in this computer generated\nplanogram, increases customer focus.\nFigure 6-9 Products are grouped together to drawn the eye to items they\nwant to sell.\n» Block placement: Products that have something in common are placed\nin a block (brands). Th is can be done side by side, on top of each other,\ncentered, or using magnetized hangers (see Figure 6-10).\n240 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFigure 6-10 Another example of a few different\ntypes of planograms being used at once.\nPlanograms are not the only method of manipulating shoppers. One test done\ninvolved a shopping mall running specifi cally designed music loops. Th e result\nwas that those shoppers stayed in the mall an average of 18% longer than when the\nmusic was not running.\nIn the Journal of Business Research, Jean-Charles Chebat and Richard Michon\npublished a study they performed in a Canadian shopping mall (www.ryerson\n.ca/~rmichon/Publications/Ambient%20odors.pdf). Th e researchers pumped\nspecially designed aromas into the air that were supposed to trigger happiness and\nthe desire to buy. Th e result there was that an average of $50 more per shopper was\nspent in that week-long study.\nYour trips to the shopping malls and grocery stores will never be the same now.\nHowever, you can learn a lot from these methods and experiments. Knowing how\npeople group things in their brains can aff ect how you organize your shelves to\nmanipulate the feelings, emotions, and thoughts of your targets.\nOn the topic of colors, they are a major way to manipulate the emotions of a\ntarget. Many of the same principles apply to colors as they do to product placement.\nTh e colors you choose to wear or use can aff ect the target. A lot of research has\nbeen done on colors and their eff ects. Th e following is a short list of some ways a\nparticular color could aff ect the thinking or emotions of another person:\n» White: White is often associated with purity, light, and cleanliness. It\ngives feelings of safety and neutrality as well as goodness and faith. Th is is\nwhy white is often used in weddings or as the color of surrender.\n» Black: Black often denotes power, elegance, mystery, and strength. It is\nused to denote authority, depth, and stability. Black gives the feeling of\ncalmness and tranquility. Because it contrasts with other colors, it can\nalso be used to enhance other colors.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 241\n» Red: Red is associated with excitement and joy. It is a color fi lled with\ncelebration, action, and energy. It can denote good health, speed, passion,\ndesire, and love. Red can stimulate emotions as well as increase heart\nrate, respiration, and blood pressure.\nRed can trigger strong emotions—use caution when using red. Even\nthough it can denote power and impulsiveness, it can denote force,\nintimidation, and conquest, even violence and revenge. Be careful how\nyou use red.\n» Orange: Orange gives warmth, enthusiasm, attraction, determination,\nstrength, and endurance. It can stimulate a person to feel invigorated and\neven stimulate his or her appetite.\nOrange is another color to be cautious with. Although using orange\nhas many good benefits, like making the viewer feel warm and attracted\nto you or your product, too much or the wrong combination can create\nfeelings of insecurity, ignorance, and sluggishness.\n» Gold: Gold is usually associated with illumination, wisdom, wealth, and\nprestige.\n» Yellow: Yellow is associated with energy and optimism, joy and cheer-\nfulness, loyalty and freshness. It can cause a person to feel focused and\nattentive.\nYellow also has an impact on a person’s memory (why are so many\nsticky notes yellow?). Used in small amounts, it can trigger positive emo-\ntions, but too much can cause a target to lose focus or feel criticized.\n» Green: Green is often associated with nature, harmony, life, fertility,\nambition, protection, and peace. It can produce a very calming eff ect,\nmaking someone feel safe.\nGreen is another power color but can also make one feel greedy,\nguilty, jealousy, and disordered if used in the wrong setting or used too\nmuch.\n» Blue: Blue is associated with the color of the sky and ocean. It can be\nlinked to intelligence, intuition, truth, tranquility, health, power, and\nknowledge. It is very calming and cooling and has been known to slow\ndown the metabolism.\nBlue is the easiest color for the eyes to focus on. It can have many\npositive effects, but be careful not to make the target feel cold or\ndepressed.\n242 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n» Purple: Purple is associated with royalty, nobility, luxury, creativity, and\nmystery.\n» Brown: Brown is associated with earth, reliability, approachability, con-\nvention, and order. It can create emotions of being rooted or connected,\nor having a sense of order.\nHow can you use all this information? I am not suggesting that with a simple\nblue outfi t you can make someone feel calm enough to hand you her password. Yet\nyou can use this information to plan your attack vectors, ensuring you have the best\nopportunity to succeed, which includes how you look and how you are dressed.\nA social engineer would want to analyze the target they will be calling on and\nmake sure the colors they choose to wear augment their ability to manipulate the\ntarget and not turn them off . For example, knowing that green may elicit feelings of\ngreed or ambition can help a social engineer decide not to wear green to a meeting\nwith a charity where it might conjure feelings and emotions contrary to the charity’s\nmission. Wearing something blue to a lawyer’s offi ce, on the other hand, can have a\ncalming eff ect, allowing the lawyer to open up more. Careful planning and sensible\nuse of these tactics can help ensure the success of your social engineering audits.\nConditioning Targets to Respond Positively\nConditioning is used in everything from normal conversation to marketing to mali-\ncious manipulation. Just like Pavlov’s dog, people have been conditioned to respond\nto certain items. Human nature is often used to manipulate the majority of people\nto take actions the manipulators want.\nWhen the majority of people think of babies they will smile, we will fi nd talking\nanimals “cute,” and we might even be manipulated to sing a jingle for a popular\nproduct in our head.\nTh ese tactics are so covert that many times we don’t even know they are working.\nMany times I fi nd myself wondering what a scantily clad, bikini-wearing woman\nhas to do with beer.\nOne example of how conditioning is used is Michelin Tires (see Figure 6-11). For\nyears this company has used babies in its ads. Why? “Because so much is riding on\nyour tires.” But these ads have more to them. You see a baby, you smile, and you\nare happy. Th at emotion triggers a positive response, and that response conditions\nyou to be agreeable to what is told to you next. When you see the baby you smile;\nwhen you see it enough you are conditioned to think of warm, happy feelings when\nyou see Michelin tires.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 243\nFigure 6-11 Aren’t babies cute?\nSeeing the baby next to the tire makes you equate positive happy feelings with\nthat brand. Th is is an example of classic manipulation.\nAnother advertisement (see Figure 6-12) that might have had many people won-\ndering from Budweiser—remember those popular frogs belching out “Bud” “weis”\nand “er”? What do frogs have to do with beer? Along those same lines, think of\nthe more recent Clydesdale horse and his gang of animal friends. Th ese ads are\ncatchy, even funny the fi rst time, but not really explaining why you want to buy\ntheir beer.\nFigure 6-12 Frogs selling lager.\n244 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh is form of manipulation, conditioning, is subtle. You laugh at that commercial,\nand then later on you pull into your local beer distributor, see a cardboard cutout\nof the frogs or horse, and smile to yourself, which creates that positive feeling that\nmakes you feel agreeable to buying the product.\nTh ese conditioning tactics are used often in the world of sales and marketing fi rms\nwith the goal of manipulating the consumer to buy their products over the competi-\ntion. Social engineers aren’t really selling a product, but they do want their targets to\n“buy” the lines they are selling, the pretext they are putting out there, and the actions\nthey want the target to take. But why use manipulation? What are the incentives to\nutilizing this powerful form of control? Th e next section covers that very topic.\nManipulation Incentives\nWhat are the incentives to manipulate someone? Th is question gets to the root of\nthe methods, thinking, and tactics used in any manipulation. Not all manipula-\ntion is negative, but is related to the incentives behind it. But each incentive can be\npositive or negative.\nWhat is an incentive? An incentive can be labeled as anything that motivates\nyou to take an action. It can be money, love, success, or anything—even negative\nemotions like hatred, jealousy, and envy.\nTh e main reasons why people chose to manipulate others can be broken down\ninto three categories: fi nancial, social, and ideological incentives. Th e following\nsections look at each of these incentives and how they apply to manipulation.\nFinancial Incentives\nFinancial incentives tend to be the most common, as in the cases mentioned earlier\nrelated to increasing sales. Many scams have a fi nancial incentive behind their tactics.\nHow many people play the lottery every day with the hopes of getting that win-\nning ticket? Th ey may spend hundreds of dollars over time, and winning a $20 payoff\nmakes them happy and keeps them coming back for more.\nA non-malicious example of fi nancial incentive is coupons. If you buy this par-\nticular product at this particular store you will get X dollars or cents off . If you are\na thrifty shopper or want to try that product you will go to that store.\nMany commercials that promote furthering your education, career, or skill set\nuse fi nancial incentives by painting a picture that your income will increase after\ntheir course or education.\nTh e malicious attacker’s incentive for using manipulation is his own fi nancial\ngain and therefore his motivation and his technique will refl ect that. For example,\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 245\nif the malicious social engineer’s goal is to get his target to part with some of his\nhard-earned money, the social engineer will utilize pretexts that will be “allowed”\nto ask for money—pretexts like charity organizations are suitable in this scenario\nbecause asking for donations or fi nancial information is not out of the ordinary.\nIdeological Incentives\nIdeological incentives are the most diffi cult to describe. Each person’s ideals are\ndiff erent and those ideals can aff ect the incentive. If your dream in life is to run a\nrestaurant then that is your passion. You will work longer hours and put in more\neff ort than any of your employees. You will also work for less money, because it is\nyour dream or your motivation; for everyone else it is just a job.\nDreams and beliefs can be so ingrained in a person that separating them from\nthe person can be almost impossible. When you hear the phrase, “I have a dream,”\ndid you think of Martin Luther King? Some people’s dreams and goals are who they\nare, not what they think about.\nPeople tend to be drawn to those with similar dreams and goals, which is why\nthe phrase, “Birds of a feather fl ock together” applies so well in this discussion. But\nit is also why so many people can be manipulated.\nLook at Christian televangelists, for example. People who have a faith and desire\nto believe in God fl ock together. Like-minded people can strengthen each other’s\nfaith and desire to do the right thing, but a televangelist can use that ideology to\nconvince people that God’s desire is for that particular church to prosper, therefore\nalso lining the televangelist’ pockets with cash.\nTh e televangelist gives a few motivating sermons and sheds some tears and sud-\ndenly people are sending in the checks. Th ese televangelists use the tools of both\nfi nancial and social ideals (see the following section, “Social Incentives”) to convert\ntheir listeners to their ideals so those people part with their hard-earned cash. What\nis interesting is that if you ask a follower how he feels about the preacher being\nway richer than he is, he believes it is God’s will. His ideal set has been changed or\nmanipulated.\nIdeological incentives can also be used for the good by educating people about\nmorals, and even resorting to using fear as the incentive can have great eff ects on\npeople. Ideological incentives are often taught to children through stories and fables\nthat have meanings behind them. Th e Brothers Grimm are an excellent example of\nthis type of incentive. Stories that often end in the bad characters suff ering physi-\ncal harm or even death and the good characters, persevering through all forms of\nhardship, getting a massive reward at the end builds on fear that being bad leads to\ndeath or some terrible punishment.\n246 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nIdeological incentives are used in marketing, too, through placing ads where\n“like-minded” ideals often “meet.” For example, diaper companies market in family\nmagazines, animal shelters market at zoos, athletic gear companies market at sport-\ning events, and so on. Th is type of incentive gives a greater chance that the goods or\nservices being advertised will be bought by those who share the same ideals.\nIdeological incentives are used to bring one’s ideals in alignment with those of a like\nmind. Often, once people are sympathetic to a cause is when the manipulation tactics\nstart. Again, not all manipulation is bad, but it has to be used in the proper way.\nSocial Incentives\nSocial incentives are probably the most widely used and the most complex set of\nincentives out there, especially when it comes to social engineering.\nHumans are social by nature; it is what we do in normal daily life. Social incentives\nalso encompass all the other types of incentives. Th e right relationship can enhance\nyour fi nancial needs and can also adjust, align, or augment your ideals. It could be\nargued that social incentives are stronger than the other two types of incentives.\nTh e power that peer pressure holds over many people is easy to see. For young and\nold alike, the draw of conformity is powerful. Many times, that which is acceptable\nis directly linked to a social incentive. One’s outlook on life and self can be greatly\naff ected by his or her social surroundings. In essence peer pressure can exist even\nin the absence of direct peers.\nAm I good looking? Well, that depends. If I am in the United States where a\nsupermodel is a size zero and the guys have muscles in places I didn’t know muscles\nexisted, probably not. If I am in ancient Rome where maybe being larger meant I\nwas rich and powerful, then I am. Your whole inner self is framed by your social\nview of the world.\nIn 1975, the U.S. Air Force ran a study entitled “Identifi cation and Analysis of\nSocial Incentives in Air Force Technical Training” to try to see the power of social\nincentives on creating leaders during its training drills. It ran four diff erent scenarios\nwith a group and analyzed what eff ects they had on the students.\nTh e end results were that a certain social incentive, usually involving praise\nor positive reinforcement from peers or authority fi gures, created a strong bond\nbetween the students and instructors:\nThe major conclusion of this entire research effort is that the man-\nagement of social incentives is a particularly difficult art. While\nsocial incentives can be identified and scaled with considerable ease,\nmanipulation and management of the same incentives requires con-\nsiderably greater effort. The scaling data show high attractiveness\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 247\nvalue for various social incentives. The results of the field experiment\nshow the positive influence of the acquaintanceship and psychologi-\ncal contract exercise on attitudes toward fellow trainees. Both of\nthese findings underline the importance of social factors.\nIn other words, increasing or decreasing the attractiveness of the social incen-\ntive is not too diffi cult once you know what motivates a person. Th is phenomenon\nis particularly evident in groups of teenagers. When they fi nd out what bothers\nsomeone, it is often used as a weapon to force compliance. Th e larger the group that\nprovides the pressure, the greater the chance the target will comply.\nTh is is a powerful statement. I wonder how that research would have gone if the\nresearchers had been able to use the plethora of social media sites that exist today. Peer\npressure is a strong infl uence and everyone wants to fi t in and be part of the crowd.\nSocial incentives work. In 2007 a group of researchers (Oriana Bandiera, Iwan\nBarankay, and Imran Rasul) wrote a research paper entitled, “Social Incentives:\nThe Causes and Consequences of Social Networks in the Workplace” (www\n.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/Manipulation/Manipulation-Social-\nIncentivespdf.pdf).\nTh e report is an interesting study along the lines of the Air Force study, but set\nin 2007. Basically the researchers analyzed how those who have “friends” at work\nhandle their jobs when they work in groups with their friends. Th eir conclusion:\nOur findings indicate there are social incentives—the presence of\nfriends affects worker productivity, despite there being no externalities\nof worker effort onto their co-workers due to the production technology\nor compensation scheme in place. Due to social incentives, workers\nconform to a common norm when working together. The level of the\nnorm is such that the presence of friends increases the productivity of\nworkers who are less able than their friends and decreases the produc-\ntivity of workers who are more able than their friends.\nSocial incentives are a quantitatively important determinant of\na worker’s performance. As workers are paid piece rates based on\nindividual productivity, the strength of social incentives is such that\n(i) workers who are more able than their friends are willing to forgo\n10% of their earnings to conform to the norm; (ii) workers who have\nat least one friend who is more able than themselves are willing to\nincrease productivity by 10% to meet the norm. Overall, the distri-\nbution of worker ability is such that the latter effect dominates so\nthe net effect of social incentives on firm performance is positive.\n248 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh e presence of friends meant that a person would actually work harder or less\nhard depending on their normal work level. Peer pressure with the absence of the\nactual pressure can aff ect people’s work. Th e pressure is perceived by what is stan-\ndard. Why? Maybe if a person could work faster or better, she probably didn’t want\nto appear to be a know-it-all or brown-noser, as these people can be called. Maybe\nif he is normally more of a slacker, he didn’t want to appear lazy so he pushed up the\npace a little. In either case their work ethic was aff ected by having friends.\nA good point for management is to always put the hardest workers and natural\nleaders over the group. But there is so much to learn in this research.\nTh is method is how social engineers use “tail-gating.” Being in a large crowd\nof people coming back from break or lunch and looking like one of the employees\nminimizes the chance that the security guard will stop you while you walk through\nthe front doors.\nIt is also how whole groups of people can be manipulated into thinking a certain\naction or attitude is acceptable. You can see this in the entertainment industry as\neach year the standard of what is acceptable or moral seems to get lowered, yet this\ndrop in standards is sold as “freedom.”\nTh ese three incentives are not the only types that are used. Th ey can branch off\ninto other aspects beyond the scope of this book, but the question still arises of how\nyou can use them as a social engineer.\nManipulation in Social Engineering\nManipulation is less about making others think like you do and making them feel\ncomfortable, and more about coercing them to do what you want.\nCoercion is not a friendly word. It means “to force to act or think in a certain\nmanner” or “to dominate, restrain, or control by force.”\nManipulation and coercion use psychological force to alter the ideology, beliefs,\nattitudes, and behaviors of the target. Th e key to using them is to make the steps so\nsmall they are almost invisible. Th e social engineer doesn’t want to alert the target\nhe is being manipulated. Some of the following methods may be very controversial\nand downright horrible, but they are used each day by scammers, identity thieves,\nand the like. One of the goals of manipulation can be to create anxiety, stress, and\nundue social pressure. When a target feels that way he is more likely to take an\naction the social engineer is manipulating them to take.\nWith that in mind, you can see why manipulation is often thought of in a negative\nlight, but it is used in social engineering and therefore must be discussed.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 249\nIncreasing a Target’s Suggestibility\nIncreasing a target’s suggestibility can involve using the neurolinguistic program-\nming (NLP) skills discussed in Chapter 5 or other visual cues. Earlier you read about\nconditioning people with the use of pen clicks or other noises or gestures that can\nelicit an emotion even when words are not spoken.\nI once saw this in action when I was with a person who was manipulating a\ntarget. He used a pen click to indicate a positive thought. He would say something\npositive and then smile and click his pen. Literally, I saw the person begin to smile\nafter about four or fi ve times of hearing the pen click. He then brought up a very\ndepressing subject and clicked his pen, and then the target smiled and felt instantly\nembarrassed. Th at embarrassment was the open door he needed to manipulate the\ntarget to do what he wanted.\nCreating a situation where the other person feels susceptible to suggestion can\nbe through repetition of ideas or other means that will soften the target to the ideas\nyou are trying to present.\nA social engineer can make sure the whole setup is geared towards this manip-\nulation—the phrases used, the word pictures painted, the clothing colors chosen\nto wear. All of it can make the target more susceptible.\nWilliam Sargant, a controversial psychiatrist and author of the book Battle for\nthe Mind, talks about the methods by which people are manipulated. According\nto Sargant, various types of beliefs can be implanted in people after the target has\nbeen disturbed by fear, anger, or excitement. Th ese feelings cause heightened sug-\ngestibility and impaired judgment.\nA social engineer can use this device to their advantage by off ering the target\na suggestion that causes fear or excitement and then off ering a solution that turns\ninto a suggestion.\nFor example, in the hit BBC TV show Th e Real Hustle, the cast ran a scam to\nshow how this works when they set up a booth in a mall that allowed people to buy\nraffl e tickets. People would buy a ticket for a chance to win three prizes worth much\nmore than the ticket they just bought.\nOne woman bought the ticket, and, of course, she won the biggest prize. Her\nexcitement was extreme because she had never won anything like this before. At\nthis point, Paul Wilson gave the suggestion to manipulate her: At the height of\nexcitement he told her she had to call a phone number and provide her bank info\nto claim her prize.\nShe did it without a second thought. Th e suggestion made sense, especially in\nthe light of her excitement.\n250 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nKnowing the target and his likes, dislikes, kids’ names, favorite teams, and favorite\nfoods, and then using this to create an emotional environment will make creating\na susceptible atmosphere so much easier.\nControlling the Target’s Environment\nControlling the target’s environment is often used in online social engineering,\nscams, and identity theft.\nBecoming part of the same social networks and groups gives the attacker the\nchance to have “face time” to be able to manipulate targets into acting or thinking\nthe way the attacker wants. Being able to use a target’s social networks to fi nd out\nwhat triggers they have is also a powerful tool.\nI used this method once when searching for an illegal scammer for a client who\nwanted to get the scammer’s contact details. I was able to gain an account on a forum\nhe used to post his “achievements.” Using this tactic of getting into his environment,\nthen befriending him, I was able to gain his trust, use his social networks to know\nwhat he was doing, and eventually get his contact info.\nAny method used to control the environment of the target can be used in this\nmanipulation technique. Controlling the environment can be as simple as approach-\ning when you know you have the least chance of interruption, or allowing a target\nto see or not see something that will cause a reaction.\nOf course, unless you plan on bringing your target to a dark closet, you can’t\nreally control his whole environment, so controlling as much as you can will take\nplanning and research. After you locate your target’s social circles, whether online\nor in the real world, you will need to spend time planning how you will get an in to\ncontrol that environment. Once inside, what elements do you want to control? A\ngood social engineer will not come in running for the “kill shot” but will take time to\nbuild a relationship and gather information before the fi nal blow is administered.\nEnvironment control is often used in police or war-time interrogations. Th e\nenvironment where the questioning will take place will have a certain atmosphere\nto make the target feel at ease, nervous, scared, anxious, or any other emotion the\nattacker (or lead offi cer) wants the target to feel.\nForcing the Target to Reevaluate\nUndermining a target’s beliefs, awareness, or emotional control of a circumstance\ncan have a very unsettling eff ect on him or her. Th is tactic is very negative because\nit is used to make a target doubt what he or she has been told to be true.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 251\nCults use this tactic to prey upon those looking for guidance through life. Many\ntimes, people who feel lost or confused are convinced that their whole belief system\nneeds to be reevaluated. When the cults have control they can be so convincing\nthat the victims can be thoroughly convinced that their family and friends do not\nknow what is best.\nOn a personal social engineering level you can make a person reevaluate the\nbeliefs he has been taught about what is safe and what is not, or what is corporate\npolicy and what is not.\nEach day social engineers use similar tactics by presenting one well-thought-out\nquestion that can cause the target to reevaluate his stand on a topic and cause him\nto falter.\nFor example, in this economy, salespeople are hungry to make sales, and you\ncould call the sales department of a company that happens to have a strict policy\nabout downloading PDFs from the web without proper scans and precautions. Yet\nyou can still place this call:\n“Hi, I am with ABC Company and I want to place an order for your product that\ncould be more than 10,000 pieces. My employer wants me to get three quotes to see\nwhether we can do better. I have uploaded the quote package to our website; can I\ngive you the URL? I am going to a meeting in two hours. Could you look over the\npackage and get me a preliminary quote before then?”\nDo think this tactic would work? Most likely the salesperson would download\nand execute that fi le with little to no thought. You have caused him to reevaluate\nthe policy he has been taught.\nMaking the Target Feel Powerless\nMaking the target feel vulnerable or powerless is another very dark, but eff ective,\ntactic. It is often used in social engineering when the pretext is an angry executive\nor someone who should have power over the target. Angry by the lack of response\nor the inability of the target to give quick answers, the attacker berates or threatens\nthe target, causing him to doubt his position and feel a loss of power.\nAnother more subtle way this is used is to undermine the belief system using\nsocial incentives. In one audit, I was stopped by a custodian while doing scans of\nthe internal network. When she did the right thing for stopping me, I reacted with\nsomething like, “Did you know that each year this company deals with a constant\nbattle against network breaches? I am trying to secure you, and you are trying to\nstop me from doing my job!”\n252 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nMy overpowering demeanor caused her to feel powerless and she backed down.\nGiving a target the impression he has no time to think or there is serious urgency\ncan also make him feel powerless. He cannot take the time to think about how to\nhandle a problem and therefore must make a decision in a way he knows he shouldn’t.\nTh is tactic was used after the recent earthquakes in Haiti. A website was launched\nthat claimed to have information on loved ones who might have been lost. Because\ntheir claim was that no one was able to provide information on their loved ones but\nthis group who set up the site, they could demand certain criteria be met to obtain\nthis information. Many people, feeling hopeless and powerless, entered too much\ninformation and clicked things they knew they shouldn’t and in the end were dam-\naged by it. Th e BBC issued a story about this and lists some tips to stay protected:\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8469885.stm.\nDishing Out Nonphysical Punishment\nClosely linked to making the target feel powerless is making them feel guilt, humili-\nation, anxiety, or loss of privilege. Th ese feelings can be so strong that a target might\npossibly do anything to “regain favor.”\nGuilt over not giving what was expected can cause humiliation and doubt, which\ncan cause the target to react the way the attacker wants.\nI don’t suggest using humiliation in most social engineering settings, but I have\nseen it used on a target in a team eff ort to open the door, and on another social\nengineering team member to soften the face of the target, making them more pli-\nable to suggestion.\nTh e fi rst attacker approached the target in a public setting trying to get informa-\ntion; he was playing the role of someone important.\nIn the middle of the conversation an underling, who happened to be female\n(and on the team), came up and asked a question that angered the fi rst attacker. He\nreacted by saying, “You have to be the dumbest person I have ever met.” In a fi t of\nanger he walked away. Th e female attacker looked dejected and hurt and was quickly\ncomforted by the target, who fed into her act. Th e target’s empathy allowed him to\nbe manipulated to give out way more information than he wanted.\nIntimidating a Target\nIntimidation is not a tactic that you might think of using in a traditional sense in\nsocial engineering. You are not going to tie up your target and go all “Jack Bauer”\non him, but you can use intimidation in subtle ways.\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 253\nSuggesting that failure to comply can lead to being laid off or other adverse con-\nsequences can intimidate the target to react a certain way. Governments often use\nthis tactic to manipulate society to believe that the economic system is collapsing.\nTh is way they can control the emotions of those they govern.\nYou can use it in a social engineering audit even by having an intimidating\nappearance. Looking busy, upset, and on a mission can intimidate many. Talking\nwith very authoritative expressions can also intimidate people.\nIn business, sending things by certifi ed mail or courier connotes a level of intimi-\ndation. Making the person sign for a package whose contents are unknown can\nmake some people intimidated. Th e goal with this manipulation tactic is to make\nthe target feel uneasy and anxious, which can cause him to react in a way he will\nlater regret, but by then it is too late.\nTh ese darker manipulation techniques are used successfully by social engineers\nand professional auditors. Manipulating a person to feel completely helpless causes\nhim or her to feel that giving in to the attacker makes sense.\nTh at really is where manipulation diff ers in a social engineering practice from\nother forms of infl uence. With negative manipulation the social engineer leaves\nand doesn’t care how the target feels later on. Even if a target realizes he has been\nhacked, it doesn’t matter because the damage is done and the company or person\nis already infi ltrated.\nOther aspects of social engineering manipulation are just as powerful but not\nso dark.\nUsing Positive Manipulation\nPositive manipulation has the same goals in mind as negative manipulation—in the\nend the target is in alignment with your thoughts and desires. Th e diff erences are\nin how you get there. But in positive manipulation, the target doesn’t need therapy\nwhen you are done.\nOver my years of research, I have compiled some tips about how parents inter-\nact with their children to get them to comply with the parents’ wishes. A few of\nits points on positive manipulation are useful for social engineers. Th e following\nsections cover some of these positive techniques.\nDisconnect Your Emotion from Their Behavior\nKeeping your emotions separate from your target’s behavior is important. As soon\nas you let your emotions get involved the target is manipulating you. You can feel\n254 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nemotion, of course, but be in control of what you feel and how you display what\nyou are feeling.\nYou do not want to be the one out of control. You also want to control the nega-\ntive emotions as much as possible so you can remain in control at all times.\nDisconnecting your emotions can also put people at ease. Th is doesn’t mean\nbeing devoid of emotion; that is not comforting to people. But if someone is really\nupset, showing the proper level of concern is good, but if your display of emotion\nis too much you can off set the target and ruin the gig.\nKeep your emotions in alignment with the pretext you are trying to achieve. If you\ndo not allow your emotions to get involved you can remain in control at all times.\nA good social engineer is able to do this despite the actions or attitudes displayed\nby the target. If the target is upset, mad, belligerent, rude, or if any other negative\nemotion is displayed, a good social engineer remains calm, cool, and collected.\nLook for the Positive to Mention\nWhenever you can, fi nd something to make a joke about or compliment, but with-\nout being creepy. You don’t want to walk up to the security guard and say, “So two\nnuns walk into a bar….” Th is method probably won’t go over too well. At the same\ntime you can’t walk into the front offi ce and say to the girl behind the counter,\n“Wow, you’re pretty.”\nFinding something positive to mention puts everyone at ease, but it must be bal-\nanced, controlled, and in good taste. Using the example of approaching a security\nguard, after introducing yourself, complimenting the picture of her children by\nsaying something like, “Wow, she is really cute; how old, four or fi ve? I have a little\ngirl at home, too,” can go a long way toward opening the door.\nAssume, Assume, Assume\nYou have probably heard what they say about people who assume, but in this case,\nassume it all. Assume that the target will act the way you want, assume he will\nanswer the way you want, and assume he will grant you all your requests.\nAssume with the questions you ask and the statements you make.\n“When I come back from the server room…”\nTh is statement assumes you belong there and you are already granted access. In\nthe security guard situation mentioned earlier, after the compliment maybe off er\na follow-up: “When I get back from checking the servers, I will show you a picture\nof my daughter.”\nAssuming that what you want will occur is a strong point, too, because it aff ects\nyour mental outlook. You must have the mental outlook that you are getting what\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 255\nyou came for; that belief system will create a new body language and facial expres-\nsions that will feed your pretext.\nIf you go in expecting failure you will fail or at best it will aff ect your body lan-\nguage and facial expressions. If you have the mental outlook that this deal is done,\nthe same will occur. A word of caution, though—don’t take this step so far you\nbecome arrogant.\nFor example, going in thinking, “Of course I have this in the bag because I am\namazing and the best,” can aff ect the way you come off and turn off the target\nquickly.\nTry Different Opening Lines\nStarting a conversation with the standard why/what/when is common but try a\ndiff erent approach and see what happens. Th e research group that runs a popular\ndating site (www.okcupid.com) compiled data that shows the value of starting out\nwith non-traditional openers.\nRemember the discussion about compliments? Well, the OkCupid guys found\nthat starting off with too “big” of a compliment had the reverse eff ect than what\none would think. Words like sexy, beautiful, and hot had terrible eff ects on people,\nwhereas words like cool, awesome, and fascinating had a better eff ect.\nIn usual greetings these guys found that saying things like “hi,” “hey,” and “hello”\nleft the target feeling blah and unmotivated, whereas “How’s it going?,” “What’s up?,”\n“howdy,” and “hola” were strong openers to use.\nOf course, these stats are about dating, but the point to be learned is that people\nreact better to nontraditional greetings.\nSimilarly, in a social engineering situation, vary your approach and you may\nnotice an increase in the way the target reacts to the message.\nUse Past Tense\nWhen you want to address anything negative that you do not want the target to\nrepeat, put it in past tense. Th is technique puts the negative attitudes and actions\nin the past in his mind, presenting him with the new and improved “clean slate” on\nwhich to do good things for you. For example:\n“When you said I couldn’t get in to meet with Mr. Smith…”\nas opposed to: “When you say I can’t get in to meet Mr. Smith….\nOnly verb tense changed, but the eff ect is very important. It gives the impression\nthat the negative statement is so far in the past, let’s move on to something new and\nimproved. It also makes the target feel that you feel it is in the past.\n256 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nSeek and Destroy\nIdentify, map, and plan how you will handle any disruptive or negative attitudes and\nactions. Imagine if your pretext is to be a tech support guy who will gain access to\nthe server room. In your previous calls you knew that every day at 10 am a large\ngroup goes out for a smoke break. You decide this is a good time as people are shuf-\nfl ing in and out. You go all prepared, but as you enter the building the receptionist\nhas just received some bad news and is an emotional mess. You should have a plan\nfor handling this disruption.\nIf you wait to think about how you will handle potential conversation stoppers,\nor disruptive infl uences, until the fi rst time you hear them you will most likely fail\nto handle them. Th at presents an interesting thought then. You have to sit back and\nthink like the target: what objections would he raise? When a person he does not\nknow calls or approaches him, what might he say? What objections might he raise?\nWhat attitudes would he portray? Th inking through these things can help you to\nmake a game plan for these potential problems.\nWrite down your thoughts and the target’s potential objections and then role\nplay. Have your spouse or friend play the mean gatekeeper or security guard. Of\ncourse, he or she cannot imitate elements such as facial expressions and so on. But\nyou can give him or her a small list of conversation stoppers to choose from to test\nyour comeback.\nPractice until you feel comfortable, but not scripted. Remember the comeback\nis not to be structured so stiffl y that you cannot alter it at all.\nPositive manipulation can have a very strong eff ect on the target. Not only does\nit not leave him feeling violated but if done properly he can feel accomplished and\nas if he did something good for the day.\nSummary\nManipulation is a key component to social engineering as well as infl uence. Th is\nchapter covered areas of human behavior that spanned decades of research from\nsome of the smartest minds on earth.\nCommon reactions to the thought of manipulating others might be:\n» “I don’t want to manipulate people.”\n» “It feels wrong to be learning this.”\nINFLUENCE: THE POWER OF PERSUASION 257\nTh ese comments represent the way most people think when they hear the word\nmanipulation. Hopefully, you’re now convinced that manipulation isn’t always a\ndark art and can be used for good.\nTh e world of infl uence has been dissected, researched, and analyzed by some of\ntoday’s brightest psychologists and researchers. Th is research served as the basis of\nmy own research to develop the information in this chapter. Th e section on framing,\nfor instance, can truly change the way you interact with people, and the concept\nof reciprocation can shape your thinking as a social engineer and how you utilize\ninfl uence. Infl uence is such an amazing topic, though, that volumes of books are\ndevoted to that topic alone.\nUnderstanding what triggers a person to motivate him to want to do a certain\naction and then having that action seem good to the target—that is the power of\ninfl uence.\nTh is chapter illuminated the science and psychology of what makes people tick,\nand clarifi ed how infl uence is used by social engineers.\nRemember, infl uence and the art of persuasion are the processes of getting some-\none else to want to do, react, think, or believe in the way you want them to.\nTh e power in this statement transcends social engineering and manipulation.\nIt is the key to altering any frame, the key to unlocking any door of manipulation,\nand the pathway to becoming a master at infl uence.\nSocial engineers also use many physical tools, some of which might look like\nthey were taken out of a page of a James Bond movie, and they are discussed in the\nnext chapter.",

In addition, it is\nnot so much having the tools but also possessing the knowledge on how to use them\nthat can bridge the gap between success and failure.\nTh is chapter discusses the diff erences between physical tools, phone tools, and\nsoftware-based tools. Note that simply possessing the most expensive or best tools\nwill not make you a social engineer. Instead, tools can enhance your security practice\nthe way that the right blend of spices can augment a meal—too much or too little\ncan make the meal bland or overpowering. You do not want to look like Batman\nwearing a utility belt going into a social engineering gig, nor do you want to be at\nthe target’s front door without the proper toolset to gain access.\nTh e social engineer’s tools category has the potential to be huge, but this book\nisn’t trying to become a manual on how to pick locks or spoof a phone number.\nInstead it is an attempt to give you enough information to decide what tools would\naugment your practice.\nTh e fi rst section of this chapter, “Physical Tools,” focuses on things like lock\npicks, shims, and cameras. Some new and exciting tools are on the market that will\nmake the average social engineer feel like James Bond. Th is chapter covers some\nof these tools and how to use them, and even shows some pictures of the tools. In\naddition, this chapter provides some information on using phone spoofi ng in a\nsocial engineering attack, continues with a discussion of some of the best software-\nbased information-gathering tools on the market, then ends with a discussion about\npassword profi ling tools.\n260 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nPhysical Tools\nPhysical security is comprised of the measures that companies or people take to\nremain secure that do not involve a computer. It often involves locks, motion cam-\neras, window sensors, and the like. Understanding physical security and how it\nworks is part of being a good social engineer. You don’t have to be an engineer of\nthese devices but having a clear understanding of the security mechanisms a target\nhas in place can help you overcome obstacles that might stand in the way of a suc-\ncessful social engineering audit.\nLock Picks\nBefore getting into the topic of picking locks you have to know a bit about how a\nlock works.\nFigure 7-1 shows a very rough image of a simple lock.\nUpper Pins\nPin Tumblers Shear Line\nPlug\nFigure 7-1 A simple view of a lock.\nBasically the way a lock works is that it has tumblers that are manipulated by the\nkey. Th e key pushes up the tumblers and upper pins, and when they line up it allows\nthe key to turn and unlock the door, server room, cabinet, and so on.\nA lock pick simulates the key in moving all the pins into the correct position\none by one, allowing the lock to turn freely and open the door. You need two main\ntools to pick a lock: picks and a tension wrench.\nPicks are long pieces of metal that curve at the end, similar to a dentist’s tool.\nTh ey reach inside the lock and move the pins up and down until they are in the\nright position.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 261\nTension wrenches are small fl at metal devices that allow you to put pressure on\nthe lock while using the pick.\nRakes look like picks but are used in a “raking” motion over the lock in an attempt\nto catch all the pins. It is the quick motion of moving the rake in and out of the\nlock that many lock pickers fi nd attractive because it usually makes quick work of\nmost locks.\nTo pick a lock, follow these steps:\n1. Insert the tension wrench into the keyhole and turn it in the same direc-\ntion you would turn the key. Th e real skill here is knowing how much\ntension to add—use too much or too little, and the pins won’t fall into\nplace, thus allowing the lock to turn. Providing just the right amount of\ntension creates a small ledge that off sets the plug enough to catch the pin\nshafts.\n2. Insert the pick and use it to lift the pins one by one until you feel them\nlock in place. You can hear a slight click when an upper pin falls into\nposition. When you get all the pins into position the plug will rotate\nfreely, and you will have picked the lock.\nTh e preceding is the $2 tour of lock picking and barely scratches its surface. If you\nwant some great information on lock picking visit any of the following websites:\n» http://toool.us/\n» http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-\nsafety/security/lock-picking.htm\n» http://www.lockpicking101.com/\nTh ese are just a few of the many sites devoted to lock-picking education. As a\nsocial engineer, spending time practicing picking locks is wise. Carrying a small\nlock-pick set with you can be a lifesaver when you’re in front of a server cabinet,\ndesk drawer, or other locked obstacle containing juicy information.\nLock pick sets can be as small as those shown in Figure 7-2, which are the size\nof a normal business card.\n262 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFigure 7-2 This business card–sized lock-pick set fits\neasily into a wallet or purse.\nTh ey can also be bulkier, as shown in Figures 7-3 and 7-4.\nFigure 7-3 This set is about the size\nof a pocketknife.\nFigure 7-4 This lock-pick set is bulkier but\ncontains everything you would need.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 263\nA good recommendation is to not let the fi rst time you play with a lock pick be\nin a critical situation. Personally, I went out and bought a few Master padlocks of\ndiff ering sizes. After I was able to successfully pick all of them I then bought a set\nof practice locks, something like those shown in Figure 7-5. Th ese come in many\ndiff erent pin types. Locks contain varying pin types, which can add to the level of\ndiffi culty in picking. Having practice locks of varying pin types and sizes maximizes\nthe eff ectiveness of your practice sessions.\nFigure 7-5 These see-through locks allow\nyou to see how you are doing.\nI have even seen some very nice setups at diff erent conferences that would be\nexcellent for learning, like a homemade lock wall. Of course, as you gather intel on\nyour target, taking pictures or just making mental notes of the types, makes, and\nmodels of the locks that might block your path to success is a good idea. Knowing\nthis information can help you prepare before you engage in your social engineer-\ning attempt.\nPractical Usage\nLock picking in the movies and on TV is portrayed such that one just puts the lock\npick in and a few seconds later the door magically opens. Sure, some people pick\nlocks that well, but the majority of people will fi nd success slowly, after countless\ntimes applying too much tension, getting frustrated, and then at last learning how\nto truly rake and pick a lock. Raking is a talent in itself. Th is is where you use a rake\ntool and gently slide the rake in and out of the lock while applying light pressure to\n264 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nthe tension wrench. Th is technique works on many types of locks, enabling them\nto be “picked” using this simple method. Learning to rake effi ciently teaches a social\nengineer a lot about how to use the tension wrench properly and what it feels like\nwhen the lock is picked.\nMany companies are starting to use RFID, magnetic badge cards, or other types\nof electronic access, which may lead one to believe that lock picks are obsolete.\nTh ey are not, and neither is the skill of lock picking. It is a good skill to have that\ncan save you in a pentest.\nHere is an example of the benefi t of carrying lock picks with you: On one engage-\nment I came upon an obstacle that could not be social engineered—a door. Pulling\nout a trusty pocket-sized lock pick set and using the raking method, I gained access\nin about 30 seconds. Many social engineers have stories like this one, where under-\nstanding a little about locks and having the right tools meant success in the end. It is\ntoo often the case that companies will spend thousands or even millions of dollars\non their hardware, fi rewalls, IDS systems, and other protection methods, and then\nput them all in a room with cheap glass and a $20 lock protecting it.\nPractice is essential because picking a lock always carries the risk of being seen or\ncaught. You must be quick about picking a lock to reduce that risk. Some places install\ncameras to catch people in the act, but in the end, unless the camera is manned by a\nlive person, it will only record a person breaking in and stealing the servers.\nIn addition, many cameras can be easily rendered useless by using simplistic\nmethods of LED lights shined right into the lens or wearing a hat or hood to cover\nyour face.\nPicking Magnetic and Electronic Locks\nMagnetic locks have become more popular because they are very inexpensive to run\nand provide a certain level of security because they are not a traditional lock that can\nbe picked. Magnetic locks come in all shapes, sizes, and strengths. Magnetic locks,\nhowever, also off er a level of insecurity: If the power goes out most magnetic locks\nwill disengage, unlocking the door. Th is is, of course, if the lock is not hooked up to\na backup power source.\nJohnny Long, world-renowned social engineer and hacker who created the\nGoogle Hacking Database and author of No Tech Hacking, tells a story of a how he\nbypassed a magnetic lock using a coat hanger and washcloth. He noticed the locks\nwere disengaged based on the motion of an employee walking toward the door. He\nalso noticed a gap in the doors that was large enough to slide a cloth attached to a\nhanger through. Waving the cloth around released the lock and gave him access.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 265\nI recently had a chance to test out this technique. Sure enough with a little eff ort\nand testing diff erent lengths of hanger, I gained access in under two minutes. What\namazed me the most about this is that despite how much money was spent on the\nprofessional, commercial-grade lock and metal doors with bulletproof glass windows\nin them, with backup power sources to the locks and autolocking bolt locks if the\npower goes out, it was all thwarted by a hanger with a rag.\nOf course there are higher-tech ways of picking these locks. Some have created\nRFID cloners, a small device that can capture then replay the RFID code unlocking\nthe doors. Th ere are machines to copy magnetic key cards as well.\nMiscellaneous Lock-Picking Tools\nIn addition to tension wrenches and picks, a social engineer may want to employ\nsome other tools, such as shove knives, bump keys, and padlock shims, to gain\nphysical access. Some of these tools, when mastered, can make the job of physical\naccess eff ortless.\nShove Knives\nTh e shove knife, shown in Figure 7-6, is hailed as the quickest way to gain access\nto offi ce doors or any door with a knob lock, such as server rooms or offi ce doors.\nBasically this knife can slip into a position where it can release the latch without\ndamaging the door.\nFigure 7-6 A typical shove knife.\nBump Keys\nBump keys have been around for ages, but have been getting a lot of notice in the\nnews because they have been used in crimes. Bump keys are specially designed\nkeys that allow the user to “bump” the key into the lock with light force that when\ndone right, puts all the pins in proper alignment and allows the plug to be turned\n266 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nwithout damaging the lock. Th e basic technique is that you put the key inside the\nlock and pull it out one or two notches; then you put light tension on the key and\nuse a screwdriver or other small object to “bump” the key into the lock using light\nforce. Th is action forces the pins into the proper position and then allows the plug\nto turn. Figure 7-7 shows a bump key.\nFigure 7-7 A typical bump key for a door.\nPadlock Shims\nA shim is a small piece of thin metal that is slid into the base of the padlock and\nused to release the locking mechanism. Th e shim is shoved in at the base of lock\nshaft, separating the locking mechanism from the shaft and unlocking the padlock.\nTh is is shown in Figure 7-8.\nShim\nFigure 7-8. How a shim works.\nFigure 7-9 shows professional-grade shims but you can also make a pair out of\nan aluminum can.\nSome recent stories (www.youtube.com/watch?v=7INIRLe7x0Y) show how easy it\nis to bypass a hotel or other door with a chain lock. Th is particular video shows how\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 267\nan attacker can tie a rubber band around the lock and, using the natural tension of\nthe rubber band, get the chain to slide right off . As well, MIT has a freely distributed\nguide (www.lysator.liu.se/mit-guide/MITLockGuide.pdf) on lock picking that\nis much more in-depth than the brief introduction included in this chapter.\nFigure 7-9 Professionally made shims.\nYou might be wondering whether locks that are impossible, or at least hard\nto pick, exist. Th e Bump Proof BiLock (www.wholesalelocks.com/bump-proof-\nbilock-ult-360.html) is just such a lock. Its two cylinders make it near-impossible\nto bump or pick easily.\nOne of the problems I have seen in my career is not the lock choice but rather\nthe security supporting the lock. Very often, a company will buy a heavy-duty lock\nthat requires biometrics and key access to get to the server room, but right next to\nthe door is a small, single-paned glass window. Who needs a lock pick then? A thief\nwill break the glass and gain access without much eff ort.\nTh e moral of the story is that a lock alone won’t make you secure. Security is a\nmindset, not a simple piece of hardware.\nNot every social engineer must be an expert locksmith, but having some basic\nknowledge on how locks work and a bit of experience picking locks might make the\ndiff erence between a social engineering success and failure.\nTh is discussion just scratched the surface of the topic of the lock-picking tools\na social engineer can use. One of the other toolsets that is invaluable for a social\nengineer is recording devices, as discussed in the next section.\nCameras and Recording Devices\nCameras and recording devices seem so “peeping Tom-ish” that many times the ques-\ntion arises, “Why? Why use hidden cameras and covert recording devices in an SE\ngig?” Good question. It has a simple two-part answer: for proof and protection.\n268 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nLet’s discuss the concept of proof. As already mentioned, a social engineering\naudit is where you are testing people. It is trying to help a company patch the human\ninfrastructure to be more secure. Unfortunately, these same principles are used\nwhen malicious social engineers do their deeds too. Many people are reluctant to\nadmit they can be duped unless they see the proof or one of their colleagues being\nduped. Th e embarrassment from being tricked through a simple social engineering\nattack or the fear of employer repercussions can cause people to say it never hap-\npened. A recording device can provide that proof, but it can also be used to train\nboth you as an auditor and your client on what to watch for.\nYou must never use these devices with the intent of getting an employee in\ntrouble or to embarrass him or her. However, the information you get from these\ndevices provides a great learning tool afterward for showing the staff who fell for\nthe social engineer’s pretext and how. Having proof of a successful hack can go a\nlong way toward educating the company and its staff on how they should react to\nmalicious social engineering attempts—in other words, how to notice and then\neither avoid or mitigate these attacks.\nTh e second reason to use recording devices in an SE gig is for protection, mainly\nfor the professional social engineers. Why? Seeing every microexpression, facial ges-\nture, and little detail that you can use later on is impossible. Capturing this informa-\ntion on camera gives you something to analyze so you do get all the details needed\nfor the attack. It can provide protection in that you have a recording of the events\nto prove what was and was not done, but also in that it doesn’t leave everything to\nyour memory of the situation. It also is a good educational tool for analyzing failed\nor successful SE attempts.\nTh is principle is used in law enforcement. Police and federal agents record their\ntraffi c stops, interviews, and interrogations for protection, education, and proof to\nbe used in court.\nTh ese principles also apply for audio recording. Capturing a phone call or con-\nversation on a recording device serves all the same purposes as the ones mentioned\npreviously for video. An important point to mention here is that recording people\nwithout their consent is illegal in many areas of the world. Make sure your ability\nto use recording devices is part of the social engineering contract you have signed\nwith the company.\nAudio recording devices come in all shapes and sizes. I own a small voice recorder\nthat is a real working pen. Th is device sits nicely in my front pocket and records\nsound clearly up to 20 feet away. With 2 GB of internal storage I can easily record a\ncouple hours of conversation without worry and then analyze it later on.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 269\nCameras\nNowadays you can fi nd cameras shaped like buttons; pens; hidden in the tips of\npens; inside clocks, teddy bears, fake screw heads, smoke alarms; and basically any\nother device you can imagine. Locating a camera like the one shown in Figure 7-10\nisn’t too hard.\nFigure 7-10 The camera is hidden\nin the knot of the tie.\nYes, believe it or not, this tie is hiding a full-color camera that runs on a 12-volt\nbattery and connects to a mini recording device. Wearing this tie into a social\nengineering audit ensures you capture everything within a 70-degree angle.\nUsing a recording device like this gives an advantage. Th e social engineer can\nfocus on the pretext or the elicitation that he or she practiced beforehand without\nhaving to worry about trying to remember every detail.\nOne story I like to tell is how I used an audio recording device in an audit where I\nwas testing a theme park that sells tickets online. Th is company operates a small ticket\nwindow with one woman behind it manning a computer with a Windows operating\nsystem on it. Th e pretext was that I bought tickets online in the hotel but couldn’t\nprint them out. To assist I printed them to PDF and emailed the document to myself.\nI then used a line similar to this: “I know this is an odd request, but my daughter saw\nyour ad at a restaurant. We went back to the hotel and bought the tickets online with\nthe discount code and then I realized I couldn’t print them out. Th e hotel printer was\non the fritz and I didn’t want to lose the tickets. So I printed them to a PDF and sent\nit to my email account. Could I just log in or have you log in to my email to get the\ndocument? “ Of course, the “kids” were waiting in the sidelines and as a dad I didn't\nwant to disappoint. Sure enough as the employee clicked the PDF, she wasn’t presented\nwith our tickets but a malicious piece of code that was scripted to give me access to\nher computer and start autocollecting data. Recording the conversation, the method\nused, and the heart strings that were pulled helped to educate the company so this\nattack could not be repeated, costing it thousands or more dollars.\n270 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nOne device that is available uses a “pay-as-you-go” cellular card to send audio\ncontent via a cellular signal to any number programmed. Or the social engineer\ncan call in and hear what is going on at any time. Th is device can save the social\nengineer dozens of hours in obtaining passwords or personal information that she\ncan use in a social engineering attack.\nOne can spend literally dozens of hours (and I could write dozens of pages) talking\nabout all the neat and cool cameras out there. Figures 7-11 and 7-12 show a few pictures\nfrom a popular law enforcement provider of “spy equipment” (www.spyassociates\n.com). All of these pictures are hidden cameras or audio recording devices, believe it or\nnot. You can use each of these devices to covertly record a target for later inspection.\nFigure 7-11 All of these devices capture audio and color video from\na hidden camera except for the pen, which is an audio recorder.\nFigure 7-12 These devices also capture audio and video\nfrom hidden cameras.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 271\nUsing the Tools of a Social Engineer\nTh e preceding section outlines some of the diff erent types of recording devices out\nthere, but the question is still how to use them. Amazing as it seems, using cam-\neras or recording devices follows the same principles as any other tool of the social\nengineer, such as pretexting or elicitation.\nPractice is essential. If you don’t determine the proper placement for a body-worn\ncamera or audio recording device, you might end up capturing video of the ceiling\nor audio of a muffl ed voice. Setting up the appropriate outfi t and gear you might\ncarry and fi nding the right location for the camera or audio device is a good idea.\nTry sitting, standing, or walking and see how these movements aff ect the sound\nand video quality.\nFrom a professional social engineer standpoint I must stress again the seriousness\nof getting the contract to outline your ability to record. Doing it without a contract\ncan be a legal nightmare. Checking the local laws to make sure you cannot get in\ntrouble for use of these devices is also a good idea.\nNever would a social engineer use these devices to record people in embarrassing\nsituations or to capture people in personal circumstances.\nDiscussion on this topic can go on and on, but hopefully this brief overview of\nthe tools that are available and how to use them can open up the options out there\nto social engineers.\nIn the next section I will give a few examples of the usage of certain tools that\ncan be very useful to a social engineer.\nUsing a GPS Tracker\nSocial engineers often want to track targets before or after they leave the offi ce. What\nstops the target makes on the way to the offi ce can tell a lot about him. Compiling\nand analyzing this information can help to develop a proper pretext or good ques-\ntions to use to elicit the right response from the target. Knowing the start and end\ntimes for his day can also be valuable for physical red team attacks, where the goal\nof the team is to actually break in and recover valuable assets to show the company\ntheir physical weaknesses.\nYou can track people in many diff erent ways, but one way is to use a device\ndesigned to help track a target. One such device is a GPS Tracker; for example, the\nnotable SpyHawk SuperTrak GPS Worldwide Super TrackStick USB Data Logger\navailable from www.spyassociates.com. One type of many, these devices can range\n272 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nfrom $200 to $600. SpyHawk SuperTrak magnetically sticks to a vehicle and can\nstore days’ worth of data on the target. Th e following sections provide a walkthrough\nfrom setup to usage of this little device.\nThe SpyHawk SuperTrak GPS TrackStick\nInstalling the software needed to make the device run is painless. Just clicking the\nsoftware that came with the device and following the on-screen steps will install\nall the software needed. It installs without any problems and the setup afterwards\nis equally as painless. Th e TrackStick screen, shown in Figure 7-13, is very intuitive\nto use and easy to set up.\nFigure 7-13 TrackStick Manager employs an intuitive, simple-to-use interface.\nAs you can see, it provides options to chose log times, time zones, and more\ncustom options.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 273\nUsing the SpyHawk TrackStick\nTh e SpyHawk SuperTrak GPS Worldwide Super TrackStick device itself is light-\nweight and easy to use and hide. It comes with an on/off switch but has some neat\ntechnology. When it feels movement it turns on and starts logging. When the move-\nment stops for a period of time, it stops logging.\nTh e directions say to hide the device somewhere with the powerful magnets\nagainst metal but the device pointing up or toward plastic. Losing the device on\nits fi rst run is always a concern, so fi nding a nice secure place under the hood\ncan ease those worries and give easy access to the sky view. Once you have access\n(either internal or external) to the target’s car, fi nd a secure location in a wheel\nwell, under the hood, or in the back of the car by the trunk. Anywhere that there\nis metal will work. If you have internal access, popping the hood and putting it\nsomewhere in the engine compartment can ease concerns over discovery and/\nor loss.\nIn my fi rst tests, I found a place in the engine compartment to place the device.\nEven through the metal of the hood the device logged perfectly. Another place-\nment idea is to wait until the target’s car is unlocked and then place it in the trunk\nunder the carpet or by the rear lights. On a personal side note, when I ran this\ntest, the device stayed on fi ve days collecting data, some of which you can see in\nthe following fi gures. As shown in Figure 7-14, it looks like the target likes to\nspeed.\nFigure 7-14 The target likes to speed.\n274 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTime, date, and duration stamps help you outline a target’s movement, as shown\nin Figure 7-15.\nFigure 7-15 Tracking the target’s movements.\nFigure 7-16 shows the icons on a Google Earth map—they show speed, times,\ntime stopped, and more.\nFigure 7-16 Device output rendered in Google Earth.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 275\nAs you can see in Figure 7-17, the software creates nice maps of the whole route.\nFigure 7-17 Mapping the target’s route with SuperTrack.\nUsing Google Earth or Google Maps you can even get close-ups (see\nFigure 7-18).\n276 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFigure 7-18 Zeroing in on the target’s travels.\nReviewing the GPS Tracker Data\nTh e data collection is where a social engineer will see the most benefi t. Being able\nto track every time the CEO of the target company stopped for coff ee, what his\nfavorite shop is, and what gym he attends can enable the social engineer to plan an\nattack with the highest rate of success.\nKnowing the locations and stops can tell the attacker where he or she will have\nthe best opportunities for cloning an RFID badge or making an impression of a key.\nTh e bonus is that you can get this information without having to stalk the target by\nbeing the creepy guy next door. Th e following fi gures show how these details can\ngive the attacker the upper hand.\nNotice the detail in Figure 7-19. You can see the speed the target drove, and the time\nand date he stopped. If you want to see the location in more detail, click the Google\nMaps link. Click the Export button to export the whole data set to a clickable Google\nMap or Google Earth Map.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 277\nFigure 7-19 The data set.\nAfter you open the data set in Google Earth you can see the points he stopped,\nthe route he took to and from his destination, and the times he stopped, as shown\nin Figure 7-20.\nFigure 7-20 Stops along the way.\n278 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nIf you want to see his whole route, it’s no problem—just export his whole route\nto one of many formats, as shown in Figure 7-21.\nFigure 7-21 Exporting the target’s entire route.\nFigure 7-22 shows the data exported and displayed in Google Maps.\nTh is short section could not possibly cover all the tools available to a social engi-\nneer. Th e keys to success are practice and research. Knowing what tools are available\nto social engineers can make or break the audit. Th at is just half the battle, though,\nbecause then as a professional social engineer, you must practice, practice, practice.\nKnowing how to properly use the tools will make a huge diff erence.\nOn the Social Engineer Framework located at www.social-engineer.org, I will\nbe reviewing many tools that social engineers can use to enhance their practice.\nPhysical tools are just one part of being a successful social engineer though. All\nthe physical tools on Earth are backed up by quality and thorough information\ngathering as discussed in Chapter 2. Th e next section covers some of the most\namazing information-gathering tools in the world.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 279\nFigure 7-22 The target’s route rendered in Google Maps.\nOnline Information-Gathering Tools\nAs previously discussed, information gathering is a key aspect of social engineering.\nNot spending enough time on this point alone can and will lead to failure for the\nsocial engineer. Nowadays many tools are available to the social engineer that can\nhelp collect, catalog, and utilize the data that is collected.\n280 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh ese tools can literally change the way a social engineer views and uses data.\nNo longer are social engineers limited to what they can fi nd in routine searches;\nthese tools open every resource on the Internet to them.\nMaltego\nCollecting and cataloging information is probably a weak point for many people.\nWhat if a tool existed that enabled you to perform dozens of searches specifi c to a\ndomain, IP address, or even a person? What if it gave you the weightings of those\nfi ndings, showing what was more likely to be important or not? What if this tool\nthen had a GUI interface that showed everything in color-coded objects that you\ncan export and utilize? On top of it all, what if a free version of this amazing tool\nwas available?\nEnter Maltego. Maltego is a social engineer’s dream tool. Th is amazing tool is\nmade by the guys at Paterva (www.paterva.com). Maltego has a community edition\navailable for free download from their website, which is also included in every edi-\ntion of BackTrack4. If you want to remove the limitations of the free edition—like\nthe number of transforms you can run and saving data—spending around $600\nwill get you a full license.\nTh e best way to show the power of Maltego is to tell a story of an audit I was\ninvolved in. I was tasked with auditing a small company that had a very small web\npresence. Th e target was to get to the CEO but he was heavily guarded, paranoid,\nand didn’t use the web much. As the owner of a printing company he was all about\nhis business and didn’t use technology to its fullest. Surely this task was going to\nbe a diffi cult one.\nI whipped out Maltego fi rst. Using just the company’s domain and pulling up all\ne-mail addresses linked with Whois info and the domain itself gave me a nice base of\ninformation to start searching with. I then delved deeper to see whether the CEO’s\nemail that came up was used on any other sites or URLs. I found he had written a\ncouple of reviews for a local restaurant and linked his email address publicly. He\nalso used it in a review he did for a restaurant in a diff erent state. Reading his review\nfully revealed that he had visited that restaurant when he was visiting family in that\nstate, even naming his brother in the review. With a few more searches in Maltego\nI located his parents and brother in that area. A few more searches with the family\nname and I found a few links that spoke about using another email he had from a\nbusiness he started there to discuss a problem he had had with a local church and\nhis switch to a new one. Later on, I found a blog post linking his Facebook page with\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 281\npictures of his family after they left a ball game where their favorite team played.\nHere is what I was able to fi nd in less than two hours of searching using Maltego:\n» His favorite food\n» His favorite restaurant\n» His kids’ names and ages\n» Th at he is divorced\n» His parents’ names\n» His brother’s name\n» Where he grew up\n» His religion\n» His favorite sports team\n» What his whole family looked like\n» His past business\nA day later I mailed a package to the target containing information about a\nraffl e for local businesses. Th e off er was that if he wins he gets a free dinner at the\nrestaurant he listed as his favorite, and three free tickets to a Yankees game. All the\nbusiness has to do is agree to have a short meeting with a sales rep to talk about a\nlocal charity. If the business agreed to that meeting its name would be entered into\nthe raffl e for a chance to win the Yankees tickets. My pretext’s name was “Joe” and\nI prepared an outline for a call to the CEO. My goal was to get him to accept a PDF\nfrom me that outlined what we want and entered him in the drawing. By the time I\ncalled, he should have received my “mailed” package and I could easily use the line,\n“Yes, he is expecting my call.”\nWhile on the phone with “Joe,” the CEO accepted and opened an email contain-\ning all the raffl e details as well as a maliciously encoded fi le, ensuring the delivery\nof the reverse shell, giving me access to his network.\nOf course, he got nothing on his screen and was frustrated that Adobe kept\ncrashing. I told him, “I’m sorry you are having problems opening the fi le; we will\ninclude your name in the raffl e and mail out some additional info to you today.”\nBut before that package went into the mail and arrived I called a report meeting to\ndiscuss how the target was completely compromised.\nTh e majority of this success was due to the use of one tool—Maltego. It helped\ncollect, organize, and categorize data for the best use.\nHow did Maltego help me succeed in this gig?\n282 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh ink of Maltego as a relational database of information, fi nding links between\nbits of information on the Internet (referred to as entities within the application).\nMaltego also takes a lot of the hard work out of mining information such as email\naddresses, websites, IP addresses, and domain information. For example, you can\nsearch for any email address within a target domain or domains automatically with\na few clicks. By simply adding the “EMAIL” transform on the screen then clicking\nin the box and typing the email I want to search for, I was given a view like what is\nseen in Figure 7-23.\nFigure 7-23 A representation of the information you can glean from Maltego.\nWhy Use Maltego?\nMaltego automates much of the information gathering and large data correlation\nfor the user, saving hours of Googling for information and determining how all that\ninformation correlates. Finding these data relationships is where the real power of\nMaltego comes into play. Although the mining is useful, discovering the relation-\nships between the information is what will help the social engineer.\nAt www.social-engineer.org/se-resources/, I have posted a few videos out-\nlining how to use Maltego to get the most out of it. In the earlier story Maltego\ncontributed largely to the exercise’s success, but the compromise came with another\namazing tool.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 283\nSET: Social Engineer Toolkit\nSocial engineers spend much of their time perfecting the human aspect of their\nskills, yet many attack vectors call for the ability to produce emails or PDFs embed-\nded with malicious code.\nBoth of these things can be done manually using many of the tools that exist in\nBackTrack, but when I was starting the www.social-engineer.org website I was\ntalking to a good friend of mine, Dave Kennedy. Dave is the creator of a very popular\ntool called FastTrack that automated some of the most common attacks used in a\npenetration test using Python scripts and a web interface. I told Dave that I thought\nit would be a neat idea to develop something like FastTrack but just for social engi-\nneers—a tool that would allow a social engineer to create PDFs, emails, websites, and\nmore with a few clicks and then focus more on the “social” part of social engineering.\nDave thought it over and decided that he could create a few easy Python scripts\nthat would allow the social engineer to create PDFs and send emails with malicious\ncode embedded in them. Th is was the birth of the Social Engineer Toolkit (SET).\nAt the time of writing, SET had been downloaded more than 1.5 million times, and\nhad quickly become the standard toolkit for social engineering audits. Th is section\nwalks you through some of the main points of SET and how to employ them.\nInstallation\nInstallation is simple. All you need to have installed are Python and the Metasploit\nframework. Both of these are installed in the BackTrack distribution and there is\nno setup to worry about—in BackTrack 4 even the SET tool is installed. In case it is\nnot or you are starting from scratch, installation is simple. Navigate to the directory\nyou want it in and run this command in a console window:\nsvn co http://svn.secmaniac.com/social_engineering_toolkit set/\nAfter executing this command, you will have a directory called set that will\ncontain all the SET tools.\nRunning SET\nRunning SET is, again, an easy process. Simply typing ./set while in the set direc-\ntory starts the initial SET menu.\nsTh is shows you exactly what the SET menu looks like. A comprehensive, in-depth tutorial\nabout each menu option is available at www.social-engineer.org/framework/Computer_\nBased_Social_Engineering_Tools:_Social_Engineer_Toolkit_%28SET%29, but\nthe following sections explain two of the most widely used aspects of SET.\n284 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFirst up is discussion the spear phishing attack, and following that is discussion\nof the website cloning attack.\nSpear Phishing with SET\nPhishing is a term coined to describe how malicious scammers will “cast a wide\nnet” using targeted emails to try to draw people to websites, open malicious fi les,\nor disclose information that can be used for later attacks. Being able to detect and\nmitigate these attacks is essential for survival in the Internet world today.\nSET allows the auditor to test their clients by developing targeted emails and\nthen logging how many employees fall for these attacks. Th is information can then\nbe used in training to help employees see how to spot and avoid these traps.\nTo perform a spear phishing attack in SET, chose option 1. After pressing that\nnumber you are presented with a few options:\n» 1. Perform a Mass Email Attack\n» 2. Create a FileFormat Payload\n» 3. Create a Social-Engineering Template\nTh e fi rst option is where you actually launch an e-mail-based spear phishing\nattack. Th e second option is where you create a malicious PDF or other fi le to send\nin your emails. Finally, option 3 is where you can create templates for use later on.\nLaunching an attack in SET is as simple as choosing the right options in the\nmenus then clicking Launch. For example, if I wanted to launch an e-mail attack\nthat would send a victim a malicious PDF disguised as a tech report, I would chose\noption 1, Perform a Mass Email Attack.\nNext, I would choose an attack vector (option 6) that was present in many ver-\nsions of Adobe Acrobat Reader: Adobe util.printf() Buffer Overflow.\nTh e next few choices set up the technical side of the attack. Using Metasploit to\nreceive the reverse shell, or connection back from the victim’s computer, and the\nport to come back on to avoid IDS or other systems, choose option 2, Windows\nMeterpreter Reverse_TCP.\nSelect port 443 so the traffi c looks as if it is SSL traffi c. Th e SET makes the mali-\ncious PDF and sets up the listener.\nAfter doing so, SET asks you if you want to change the name of the PDF to\nsomething more devious like TechnicalSupport.pdf and then asks you to fi ll in\nthe email information for both sending and receiving. Finally, SET sends out a\nprofessional-looking email that will try to trick the user into opening the attached\nPDF. A sample of what the victim receives is shown in Figure 7-24.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 285\nFigure 7-24 An innocuous email with a simple attachment.\nAfter the e-mail is sent, SET sets up the listener and waits for the target to open\nthe fi le. Once the target clicks the PDF, the listener responds by handling the incom-\ning malicious code and giving the attacker access to the victim’s computer.\nSurprisingly (or perhaps not, depending on your outlook), all of this was done\nin maybe six or seven mouse clicks, and it leaves the auditor with the freedom to\nfocus on the actual social engineering aspect of these attacks.\nTh is is a devastating attack because it exploits a client-side piece of software, and\nmany times there is no indication onscreen that anything bad happened.\nTh is is just one of the many attacks that can be launched using SET.\nWeb Attack Vector\nSET also allows the auditor to clone any website and host it locally. Th e power of\nthis type of attack is that it allows the social engineer to trick users into visiting\nthe site under the pretense of being a developer making changes, or even using the\ntrick of adding or deleting one letter in the URL but pointing people to the new\nsite that is cloned.\nOnce at the cloned website, many diff erent parts of this attack can be launched—\ninformation gathering, credential harvesting, and exploiting are just a few.\nTo run this attack in SET you would choose option 2, Website Attack Vectors, from\nthe main menu. Upon choosing option 2, you are presented with a few options:\n» 1. Th e Java Applet Attack Method\n» 2. Th e Metasploit Browser Exploit Method\n» 3. Credential Harvester Attack Method\n» 4. Tabnabbing Attack Method\n» 5. Man Left in the Middle Attack Method\n» 6. Return to the previous menu\n286 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nA particularly evil attack vector is option 1, a Java Applet Attack. Basically,\nthe Java Applet Attack presents the user with a Java security warning saying that\nthe website has been signed by ABC Company and asks the user to approve the\nwarning.\nTo perform this attack chose option 1, and then option 2, Site Cloner.\nUpon choosing Site Cloner, you will be asked which website you want to clone.\nHere, you can chose anything you want—the client’s website, a vendor they use, or a\ngovernment website—the choice is yours. As you might imagine, though, choosing\na site that makes sense to the target is essential.\nIn this exercise, imagine you cloned Gmail. You would be presented with the\nfollowing on the screen:\nSET supports both HTTP and HTTPS\nExample: http://www.thisisafakesite.com\nEnter the url to clone: http://www.gmail.com\n[*] Cloning the website: http://www.gmail.com\n[*] This could take a little bit...\n[*] Injecting Java Applet attack into the newly cloned website.\n[*] Filename obfuscation complete. Payload name is:\nDAUPMWIAHh7v.exe\n[*] Malicious java applet website prepped for deployment\nOnce you are done with this, SET will ask you what type of connection you want\nit to create between you and the victim. To use a technology discussed in this book,\nchoose the Metasploit reverse shell called Meterpreter.\nSET gives you the option to encode your payload with diff erent encoders. Th is\nis to help you avoid getting caught by antivirus systems.\nNext, SET launches its own built-in web server, hosts the site, and sets up a\nlistener to catch your victim browsing the website.\nNow it is up to the social engineer to either craft an email or a phone call\nto draw the target to the URL. In the end, the user would see what is shown in\nFigure 7-25.\nTh e end result is the victim is presented with a Java Applet stating the site has\nbeen signed by Microsoft and that the user needs to allow the security certifi cation\nto be run in order to access the site.\nAs soon as the user allows the security certifi cation, the attacker is presented\nwith a prompt to their computer.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 287\nFigure 7-25 Who wouldn’t trust a digitally signed applet from Microsoft?\nOther Features of SET\nSET was developed by social engineers with social engineers in mind, so the toolset\nthat it gives the user is based around the common attacks needed by those in the\nauditing business.\nSET is constantly growing and expanding. In recent months, for instance, SET\nhas become capable of handling other attacks besides website cloning and spear\nphishing; it also houses an infectious media generator. An infectious media genera-\ntor is where the user can create a DVD, CD, or USB key encoded with a malicious\nfi le that can be dropped or left at the target’s offi ce building. When it is inserted into\na computer it will execute that malicious payload and cause the victim’s machine\nto be compromised.\nSET can also create a simple payload and proper listener for it. If the social\nengineer just wants to have an EXE that is a reverse shell that will connect back to\nhis servers, he can carry this in a USB key for use on an audit. If he fi nds himself\nin front of a machine to which he wants remote access, he can put in the USB key\nand drop the payload fi le on the computer then click it. Th is will give him a quick\nconnection back to his machines.\nA newer attack vector is the Teensy HID attack vector. Teensy devices are tiny\nprogrammable circuit boards that can be embedded into things like keyboards,\nmice, or other electronic devices that get plugged into computers.\n288 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nSET produces the programming needed to tell these tiny boards what to do\nwhen they are plugged in; commands like giving reverse shells or setting up listen-\ning ports are common.\nOne of the newest features of SET is a web interface to the tool. Th is means that\na web server will start automatically to host the SET on a webpage for easier use.\nFigure 7-26 shows what this web interface looks like.\nFigure 7-26 The new web interface of the Social Engineer Toolkit.\nSET is a powerful tool made to help a social engineer auditor test the weaknesses\nthat usually exist in a company. Th e SET tool developer is always open to suggestions\nand help in creating new parts of the tool to continue growing it to become a more\npopular toolset. Again, www.social-engineer.org has a full explanation of every\nmenu option for review if you want to delve deeper into this amazing tool. Continue\nto check both www.social-engineer.org www.secmaniac.com for updates to the\nSocial Engineer Toolkit.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 289\nTelephone-Based Tools\nOne of the oldest tools in the book for social engineers is the telephone. Nowadays,\nwith cell phones, VoIP, and homemade phone servers, the options of how a social\nengineer can utilize the phone have grown considerably.\nBecause people are inundated with telemarketing calls, sales pitches, and adver-\ntisements, a social engineer needs to be skilled to use the phone successfully in an\naudit. Despite these limitations, using the phone as a social engineering tool can\nlead to total compromise of a company in a very short period of time.\nIn an era where everyone has a cell phone and people carry on personal and\ndeep conversations on the bus, subway, or in any public place, the phone can be\nused in many ways. Eavesdropping or calling a target on their cell phone allows for\nadditional vectors that were not available in days past. With the increased numbers\nof smart phones and computer-like phones on the market more and more people\nare storing passwords, personal data, and private information on their phones. Th is\nopens up the ability for the social engineer to be able to access the target and their\ndata in many diff erent situations\nAlso, being connected 24/7 makes people more ready to give out information\nquickly if the caller passes a certain set of “criteria” that makes him believable.\nFor instance, if the caller ID on the cell phone indicates that the person is calling\nfrom corporate headquarters, many people would give over information with no\nverifi cation. Both the iPhone and Android smart phones have applications that\ncan be used to spoof your caller ID number to any number you want. Apps like\nSpoofApp (www.spoofapp.com) allow the social engineer to make calls that look\nas if they originate from anywhere on earth for a relatively low cost per call. All of\nthis goes to building credibility of your pretext.\nUsing the phone for social engineering can be broken down into two diff erent\narenas: the technology behind it and planning out what you say.\nCaller ID Spoofing\nCaller ID has become a commonplace technology in both business and home use.\nEspecially now with cell phones replacing many of the land-based phone lines people\nuse, caller ID is part of daily life. Being aware of this fact and how to use this to your\nadvantage is a must for a successful social engineer.\nCaller ID spoofi ng basically is changing the information that appears on the\ntarget’s caller ID display. In other words, though you are placing the call from one\nnumber, a diff erent number appears on the target’s caller ID.\n290 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nOne way to leverage this information is to spoof the number you found in a\ndumpster dive of a vendor used by your target. If the social engineer fi nds out that\nthey use ABC Tech for computer support, the social engineer can fi nd their number,\nand spoof that when a call is placed to set up an afternoon appointment. Using caller\nID spoofi ng, you can “originate” calls from the following places:\n» A remote offi ce\n» Inside the offi ce\n» A partner organization\n» A utility/service company (telephone, water, Internet, exterminator, and\nso on)\n» A superior\n» A delivery company\nSo how do you spoof? Th e following sections discuss some of the methods and\nequipment available a social engineer can use to spoof numbers.\nSpoofCard\nOne of the most popular methods of caller ID spoofi ng is by using a SpoofCard\n(www.spoofcard.com/). Using one of these cards, you call up the 800 number given\nto you on the card, enter your PIN, the number you want the caller ID to display,\nand then the number you want to call.\nSome new features of the SpoofCard off er you the ability to record the phone\nconversation and mask your voice to be male or female. Th ese features maximize\nthe ability to hide who is calling and trick the target into divulging information\nthe social engineer seeks.\nOn the plus side, SpoofCard is simple to use, it needs no extra hardware or soft-\nware other than your phone, and it has proven service with thousands of customers.\nTh e only real negative to SpoofCard is the cost involved to purchase it.\nSpoofApp\nWith so many people using smart phones like the iPhone, Android, or the Blackberry\nthere has been an infl ux of apps created to assist in caller ID spoofi ng. SpoofApp\nuses SpoofCards (see the preceding section) but bundles the features into a package\non your cell phone.\nInstead of having to call a toll free number you simply enter the number you\nwant to call into the application, then enter the number you want to display, and\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 291\nSpoofApp connects you to the target displaying the information you requested to\nthe target. All of this is as simple as a click of a button.\nAsterisk\nIf you have a spare computer and a VoIP service you can also use an Asterisk\nserver to spoof caller IDs. You can find some information about this method at\nwww.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/CallerIDspoofing/CallerID-\nSpoofingWithAsterisk.html. An Asterisk server is very similar to how SpoofCard\nworks, with the exception of the server used to spoof the ID. In this case, you own\nthe server. Th is is attractive because it allows for more freedom and there is no fear\nof being cut off or minutes running out.\nTh e positive aspects of Asterisk are that it is free, it’s easy to use and fl exible\nafter setup, and you alone control it. Minuses include that an extra computer or\nVM is needed, Linux knowledge is required, and you need a current VoIP service\nprovider.\nTh e great part about this option is that all the information about the caller and\nthe person called resides with the social engineer. Personal and account data are\nnot in the hands of a third party.\nUsing Scripts\nTh e telephone is a favorite tool of the social engineer. It off ers anonymity as well\nas the ability to practice on numerous targets by changing just slight parts of the\npretext.\nOne aspect of using the phone in social engineering that you must consider is\nthe use of scripts. Scripting can be an essential part in ensuring that all the needed\nelements are covered and touched on; however, a script should not be a word-for-\nword speech to be given. Nothing irritates the target more than to be presented\nwith a person who sounds like he is reading a script.\nAfter you write a script you should practice it over and over so you sound real,\ngenuine, and believable,\nTh is is where your information-gathering sessions will become vital. Th e better\nthe information the social engineer gathers the clearer the script will become. I\nfi nd it useful to read a few facts on the hobbies and interests of the target so I can\nuse that to build rapport.\nOnce you have all the information laid out it can be helpful to then outline a plan\nof attack. In the case discussed previously—the CEO of the printing company—I had\nto develop an outline that would allow me to utilize the key parts of my pitch, high\n292 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\npoints I wanted to hit, as well as notes to myself like, “speak clearly,” “don’t forget to\npush the charity,” “slow down,” and so on, which kept me focused during the call.\nUsing a script or outline versus a fully written out manuscript will keep you\nfl uid and natural and allow creative freedom when presented with things you didn’t\nplan for.\nTh e telephone is still a deadly tool for the social engineer and when used with\nthe principles mentioned so far in this book, it can lead a social engineer down the\npath of success.\nPassword Profilers\nAnother set of tools that bear mentioning help you profi le targets and the passwords\nthey may use. After you have all the information on a target you can gather, your\nnext is to develop a profi le. A profi le is where you plan out a few attack vectors you\nfeel will work and also where you can start to build a list of potential passwords to\ntry in brute force attacks. From a tool perspective, having a list of possible passwords\ncan assist in expediting a hack if you are presented with that option. Th is section\ncovers a couple profi lers that are available.\nPassword profi ling tools can take hours or even days off the work that you need\nto do.\nEach year the number of people falling prey to simple attacks increases, despite\nthe many warnings that are issued. Th e number of people who list all sorts of infor-\nmation about themselves, their families, and their lives on the Internet is amazing.\nCombining a profi le built from their social media usage, what is found elsewhere on\nthe web, and using the tools discussed subsequently, a social engineer can outline\na person’s whole life.\nOne of the reasons this works so well is the way that many people chose their\npasswords. It has been proven that many people will use the same password over\nand over again. What is worse is that many people choose passwords that can be\neasily guessed with little to no skill.\nRecently, BitDefender, an Internet security fi rm, performed a study that proved\nthis fact. BitDefender analyzed the password usage of more than 250,000 users. Th e\nresults were amazing: 75% of the 250,000 used the same passwords for email as well\nas all social media accounts. Th is should be especially scary considering the recent\nstory of how 171 million Facebook users had their personal information released on\na torrent. Th e full story can be found at www.securityweek.com/study-reveals-\n75-percent-individuals-use-same-password-social-networking-and-email.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 293\nIn 2009 a hacker by the nickname of Tonu performed a very interesting bit of\nresearch. With no malicious intent he obtained a recently dropped URL of a popular\nsocial media site. He spoofed the page, then for a brief period of time logged the\nattempts of people trying to log in.\nYou can view the results at www.social-engineer.org/wiki/archives/\nBlogPosts/MenAndWomenPasswords.html.\nSome of this data will shock even the most seasoned security professionals. Out\nof 734,000 people, 30,000 used their fi rst name as a password and almost 14,500\nused their last name. Although those numbers are shocking what was found next\nwas mind blowing—the top eight most commonly used passwords are outlined in\nthe following table.\nPassword Gender Number of Users\n123456 M 17601\npassword M 4545\n12345 M 3480\n1234 M 2911\n123 M 2492\n123456789 M 2225\n123456 F 1885\nqwerty M 1883\n17,601 males used the password 123456? Staggering statistics.\nIf this isn’t shocking enough, Tonu posted statistics that more than 66% of the\nusers on that list used passwords that were six to eight characters long. With the\ninformation that most people have simple passwords, using a popular password-\ncracking tool, like Cain and Abel shown in Figure 7-27, to crack a simple password\nis not unreasonable for a social engineer to do.\nYou will notice that the Time Left box says 3.03909 days. To most hackers, three\ndays is a short time to wait to be given clear access to the servers. Is three days really\nthat long to wait for the administrator password?\nTo make this information really hit home, look at Figure 7-28, which shows the\ndiff erence made if the same user were to use a 14–16 character password containing\nupper and lower case as well as non-alphanumeric characters.\n294 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nFigure 7-27 Only three days to crack a simple password.\nFigure 7-28 The Time Left box has increased to trillions of years.\nTHE TOOLS OF THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 295\nDoes more than 5 trillion years seem a little long to wait? By just increasing\nthe characters to 14 and using some non-basic characters (that is, *, &, $, %, and ^)\nthe odds of a hacker obtaining the password through brute force become next to\nimpossible.\nBecause many users don’t use this level of complexity, identifying the weakness in\nmany users’ passwords is not diffi cult. Certain tools (a couple of which are described\nin the next section) help profi le potential passwords a user may have chosen.\nCommon User Password Profiler (CUPP)\nProfi ling a person is one of the main aspects of a successful social engineering audit.\nAs previously discussed, Tonu’s research shows that out of 734,000 people, more\nthan 228,000 of them used only six characters in their passwords. More than 17,000\nof those chose to use the password of “123456” and close to 4,600 chose the word\n“password” as their password.\nCommon User Password Profi ler (CUPP) is a tool that was created to make\npassword profi ling an easy task.\nMuris Kurgan, also known as j0rgan, created this amazing little tool. It runs\nas a script in the leading penetration testing distribution, BackTrack, or you can\ndownload it from www.social-engineer.org/cupps.tar.gz.\nTh e most common form of authentication is the combination of a username and\na password or passphrase. If both match values stored within a locally stored table,\nthe user is authenticated for a connection. Password strength is a measure of the\ndiffi culty involved in guessing or breaking the password through cryptographic\ntechniques or library-based automated testing of alternate values.\nA weak password might be very short or only use alphanumeric characters,\nmaking decryption simple. A weak password can also be one that is easily guessed\nby someone profi ling the user, such as a birthday, nickname, address, name of a pet\nor relative, or a common word such as God, love, money, or password.\nBecause most users have weak passwords that can be easy to guess, CUPP is a\nperfect tool for profi ling. It can be used for legal penetration tests or forensic crime\ninvestigations.\nTh e following is a copy/paste from a session using CUPP in BackTrack 4:\nroot@bt4:/pentest/passwords/cupp# ./cupp.py -i\n[+] Insert the information about the victim to make a dictionary\n[low cases!]\n[+] If you don’t know all the info, just hit enter when asked!\n;)\n> Name: John\n296 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n> Surname: Smith\n> Nickname: Johnny\n> Birthdate (DDMMYYYY; i.e. 04111985): 03031965\n> Wife’s(husband’s) name: Sally\n> Wife’s(husband’s) nickname: Sals\n> Wife’s(husband’s) birthdate (DDMMYYYY; i.e. 04111985):\n05011966\n> Child’s name: Roger\n> Child’s nickname: Roggie\n> Child’s birthdate (DDMMYYYY; i.e. 04111985): 05042004\n> Pet’s name: Max\n> Company name: ABC Paper\n> Do you want to add some key words about the victim?

Good luck!\nNotice at the end that a dictionary fi le of 13,672 passwords using the information\nprovided was created. Th e power of this type of tool is that it can take a lot of the\nguesswork out of the password-guessing aspect of social engineering.\nCeWL\nAs described by its authors, CeWL is a Ruby application that spiders a given URL\nto a specifi ed depth, optionally following external links, and returns a list of words\nthat can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper.

A tool alone is useless, but the knowledge of how to leverage and utilize\nthat tool is invaluable.\nIf one overwhelming theme in this chapter resounds, it is that practice makes\nperfect. Whether you are using the phone, software-based tools, the web, or other\nspy gadgets, practicing how to utilize them is essential to success. For example,\nwhen using the phone for social engineering, you can use spoofi ng technologies\nor even voice-changing technologies, and while having all this great technology is\namazing, if you make a call and sound too scripted, nervous and jittery, or unpre-\npared and unknowledgeable, then all hope for social engineering success is lost and\nmost likely any credibility, too. Th is principle goes back to being very well versed in\npretexting. How would the person you are trying to impersonate talk? What would\nhe say? How would he say it? What knowledge would he possess? What information\nwould he ask for?\nWhether the social engineer uses a software tool, hardware tool, or both, taking\nthe time to learn the ins and outs of each tool and each feature can make or break\nthe success of the audit.\n298 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTools can take substantial time off audits and they can also fi ll in any defi ciency\ngaps an auditor may have. Th is dynamic becomes apparent as you analyze the case\nstudies in Chapter 8.",
    "question": "What are the key tools and techniques used by social engineers to gather information and perform physical and digital access?",
    "summary": "This chapter discusses the importance of having the right tools and knowledge for successful social engineering. It covers physical tools like lock picks, shims, and bump keys, as well as software-based tools such as Maltego and the Social Engineer Toolkit (SET) for information gathering and attacks. It also explains how to use recording devices and caller ID spoofing to enhance social engineering efforts. The key takeaway is that while tools are essential, they are only as effective as the social engineer's understanding and practice of their use."

    "text": "Case Studies:\n8\nDissecting the\nSocial Engineer\nTh e best security is through education.\n—Mati Aharoni\nT\nhroughout this book I go through each aspect of what makes a great social\nengineer. Putting the information in these pages into play can make a social\nengineer a force to be reckoned with.\nIn school, students review history to learn what should or should not be done.\nHistory is a great tool for educating us about what things have worked in the past\nand why. It can tell us where we are going and how we can get there.\nSocial engineering history is not so diff erent. Th roughout the history of business,\npeople have been there to scam and steal. People have devoted their lives to helping\nsecure against those bad forces.\nDiscussing the aspects of professional social engineer attacks is often diffi cult\nbecause they were either done illegally or cannot be openly discussed due to client\ncontracts. Fortunately, Kevin Mitnick—world famous social engineer and computer\nsecurity expert—has published many of his stories for our reading pleasure. I have\ntaken some of these stories from his book Th e Art of Deception.\nIn this chapter I pick two of Mitnick’s most famous stories from his books and\ngive a brief recap of what Kevin did, analyzing what aspects of social engineering\nhe used and discussing what everyone can learn from it.\nAfter dissecting those two accounts I do the same with two of my own accounts\nthat demonstrate the ease with which you can obtain information and how easily\nyou can use the information to compromise an entire company. Finally, I will dis-\nclose two “top-secret” stories whose sources I can’t even mention, but as you will\nsee, you will learn a lot from these accounts. What I am aiming to accomplish is to\nshow you how dangerous even little bits of information can be, and how devastat-\ning they can be in the hands of a skilled social engineer. At the same time, you will\n300 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nsee where a social engineer can learn from past successes and failures to enhance\ntheir own skill set.\nLet’s get started with the fi rst case study.\nMitnick Case Study 1: Hacking the DMV\nKevin Mitnick is widely known as one of the world’s most notorious social engineers.\nHe has performed some of the boldest and most famous exploits in the world—and\nthe exploit examined here is especially so.\nA driver’s license can often come in handy for obtaining information on people.\nHaving the target’s driver’s license number can allow a social engineer to gain all sorts\nof personal information. However, no free services exist that allow a person to gain\naccess to this personal information. A social engineer or private investigator must go\nthrough some lengths to be able to obtain and then use this information on a target.\nKevin Mitnick, in his book Th e Art of Deception, has a story he called “Th e\nReverse Sting.” Th e following sections provide some background information and\nanalysis of this account.\nThe Target\nIn one of Mitnick’s greatest stories, he discusses how “Eric” wanted to use the non-\npublic Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and police systems to obtain people’s\ndriver’s license numbers. He regularly needed to obtain license information on tar-\ngets. Eric had a method of obtaining this information but feared repeated social engi-\nneering calls would render calling the DMV useless or alert the police to his ways.\nHe needed a diff erent method to access the DMV’s network and with some\nknowledge of the how the DMV works he knew just how to do it. His target was\ntwofold—not only the DMV but also the police would assist him (of course, without\nknowing it) in accomplishing his goal of obtaining this information.\nThe Story\nEric knew that the DMV could give privileged information to insurance agencies,\nprivate investigators (PIs), and certain other groups. Each industry has access to\nonly certain types of data.\nAn insurance company is privy to diff erent information than a PI, whereas a law\nenforcement agent can get it all. Eric’s goal was to get all the information.\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 301\nObtaining an Unpublished DMV Phone Number\nEric took a few steps that really proved his excellent social engineering skills. First\nhe called telephone information and asked for the phone number for DMV head-\nquarters. Of course, the number he was given was for the public and what he wanted\nwas something that would get him deeper.\nHe then called the local sheriff ’s offi ce and asked for Teletype, which is the offi ce\nwhere communications are sent to and received by other law enforcement agencies.\nWhen he reached the Teletype department, he asked the person for the number that\nlaw enforcement would use when calling the DMV headquarters.\nNow I don’t know about you, but that seems like it would fail. It just about did:\n“Who are you?” he was asked\nHe had to think quickly and responded, “Th is is Al. I was calling 503-555-5753.”\nAll he did was give a random number with the same area code and base num-\nber and made up the last four digits. Th en he just shut up. Th e offi cer made some\nassumptions:\n» He was internal and already had the number for a non-public area\n(Teletype).\n» He had almost all the number for the DMV.\nWith those two facts fi rmly in the offi cer’s mind he assumed that Eric was allowed\nin and gave him the number. Eric wanted more than one number, though; he wanted\nas many as he could get his hands on.\nAccomplishing this goal would require an even deeper hack—a multi-level, multi-\nfaceted attack with many diff erent avenues. It would be of epic proportion.\nGaining Access to the State’s Phone System\nEric called the number he was given to get into the DMV. He told the DMV repre-\nsentative he was from Nortel and needed to speak to a technician because he worked\nwith the DMS-100, a much-used switch.\nWhen he was on with the technician he claimed to be with the Texas Nortel\nTechnical Assistance center and explained he was updating all switches. It would be\ndone remotely and the technician wouldn’t need to do anything except provide the\ndial-in number to the switch so Eric could perform the updates directly from the\nTechnical Assistance center.\nTh is story sounded completely believable, so the technician complied, giving Eric\nall the info he requested. Armed with this information he could now dial directly\ninto one of the state’s telephone switches.\n302 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nGetting a Password\nTh e next hurdle was one that could have stopped this whole hack dead in its tracks—\ngetting passwords. Th e Nortel switches that the DMV used were password pro-\ntected. From past experience in using Nortel Switches Eric knew that Nortel uses\na default user account, NTAS. Eric then dialed in several times trying the standard\npasswords he has encountered:\n» NTAS—fail\n» Account name—fail\n» Helper—fail\n» Patch—fail\n» Update—SUCCESS\nWow, really? Th e password was update. He now had full control over the switch\nand all lines connected to it. He queried the telephone lines that were his target. He\nquickly found out that 19 phone lines went to the same department.\nAfter checking some of the internal setup of the switch he found out that the\nswitch was programmed to hunt through the 19 lines until it found one that was\nnot busy. He picked line 18 and entered the standard forwarding code that added a\ncall forwarding command to that phone line.\nEric bought a cheap, pre-paid cell phone that could be disposed of easily. He\nentered that number as the number to forward to when line 18 was rung. Basically,\nas soon as the DMV got busy enough to have people on 17 lines, the 18th call would\nnot ring to the DMV, but to Eric’s cell phone.\nIt wasn’t too long until that started happening. Around 8:00 a.m. the next\nmorning the cell phone started to ring. Each time, it was a police offi cer looking\nfor information on a person of interest. He would fi eld calls from police at his\nhouse, at lunch, in the car—no matter where he was he pretended to be the DMV\nrepresentative.\nWhat made me personally get a good laugh was how the calls are reported as\ngoing:\nTh e cell phone would ring and Eric would say, “DMV, may I help you?”\n“Th is is Detective Andrew Cole.”\n“Hi Detective, what can I do for you today?”\n“I need a Soundex on driver’s license 005602789.”\n“Sure, let me bring up the record.” While he simulated working on a computer\nhe asked a couple questions: “Detective Cole, what is your agency?”\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 303\n“Jeff erson County.”\nEric would then launch the following questions: “What is your requestor code?”\n“What is your driver’s license number?” “What is your date of birth?”\nAs the offi cer would give all his personal information, Eric would pretend to be\nverifying it all. Th en he would feign confi rmation and ask what details he needed on\nhis call. He would pretend to look up the name and other information then say, “My\ncomputer just went down again. Sorry, detective, my computer has been on the blink\nall week. Would you mind calling back and getting another clerk to help you?”\nTh is would be a little irritating, I am sure, for the offi cer, but it would tie up all\nthe loose ends. In the meantime, Eric now owned the identity of that offi cer. He\ncould use this information for many things, but mostly to obtain information from\nthe DMV whenever he needed.\nHe did his DMV information gathering for a few hours then called back into\nthe switch and disabled call forwarding; he now had a juicy list of information in\nhis possession.\nFor months after this hack, Eric could easily dial back in, enable the call forward-\ning switch, collect a number of offi cer information facts, disable call forwarding,\nand then use those police credentials to obtain valid driver’s licenses that he would\nsell to private investigators or others who would not ask how he obtained this\ninformation.\nApplying the SE Framework to the DMV Hack\nIn the story, Kevin identifi ed some things that Eric did and attitudes he had that\nmade him successful, such as not being afraid or uncomfortable talking to police\nand being able to fi nd his way around unfamiliar areas.\nYou can also identify what part of the social engineering framework Eric used\nand how he used it.\nFor example, the fi rst step in any successful social engineering audit or attack is\ninformation gathering. In this account you can see that Eric must have really done\nhis homework prior to the attack. He knew a lot about the phone system, the way\nthe DMV operates, and the general workings of the process he wanted to infi ltrate. I\nam not sure how long ago this attack occurred, but nowadays making an attack like\nit is even easier due to the Internet. It is a goldmine for information gathering. Just\na couple of years ago someone fi gured out a hack for a Tranax ATM, and within a\nfew weeks manuals containing step-by-step processes of how to perform the attack\nwere available on the Internet.\n304 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nAlso, as mentioned previously in this book, choosing a pretext that mimics what\nyou do in real life or things you did in the past can increase your chance of success.\nTh e power lies in the fact that because the pretext is more “realistic” to you it helps\nyou gather information as well as breach the target. Eric seemed to have a very\nintimate knowledge of this fi eld.\nAs you may recall, the next part of the framework is elicitation, or being able to\ncleverly craft questions to obtain information or access to something you want. Eric\nelicited information masterfully. When on the phone with the police, Eric’s use of\nelicitation served as the proof that he was who he said he was and knew his “job”\nwell. He knew the lingo and asked routine questions that had to be answered. As a\nmatter of fact, not asking those questions would have probably caused more of an\nalarm than by asking them. Th at is the power of good elicitation tactics.\nEarly on Eric knew he had to obtain certain phone numbers to perform the attack.\nInstead of trying to explain why he needed certain information, he used an assump-\ntive close as mentioned in Chapter 3, and asked questions that basically stated, “I\ndeserve these answers now, so tell me what I am asking.” Th is is another example\nof powerful elicitation; you can learn a lot from analyzing his methods closely.\nMost good attacks also include a very high amount of pretexting. Th is account\nwas no exception. Eric had to develop a few pretexts in this attack vector. He had\nto switch gears many times to accomplish his goals. As impressive as it is that Eric\nhad to impersonate law enforcement (which he did very well), keep in mind that this\npractice is highly illegal in the United States. You can learn much from the process\nand methods Eric used, but be cautious how you apply them. Even in a paid social\nengineering audit, impersonating a law enforcement agent is illegal.\nKnow your local laws—that is the lesson—or don’t be afraid to be caught. Despite\nthe fact that it is illegal, you can learn a lot from analyzing Eric’s attitude in this\nhack. He was always collected. When he put on the pretext of the DMV agent he was\nable to use elicitation that served as the proof. When he put on the police pretext,\nhis demeanor, voice, and phrases all backed up the pretext. Switching gears can be\nhard for many people, so it is best to practice before you go “live” with this.\nEric’s pretexts were solid and he did a masterful job at holding them together,\nespecially when he had to act as a DMV agent and fi eld real calls from police. In\nmany circumstances he could have easily fallen out of character but he seemed to\nhold it together quite well.\nMany of the techniques used for the psychological aspects of social engineer-\ning, such as eye cues and microexpressions, were not used in this attack because\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 305\nit happened mostly over the phone. Eric did have to utilize certain aspects of the\nframework, though, such as rapport building, NLP (neurolinguistic programming),\nand modes of thinking.\nEric seemed to be a natural at building rapport. He was personable and easygo-\ning, he seemed to not be afraid of the “what ifs,” and was able to be and act confi -\ndent in his abilities. He posed his voice and his conversation in a way that gave the\nperson on the other end of the phone all the reason to trust him and no reason to\nnot believe him.\nEric used impressive interrogation and interview tactics, even using them on\nlaw enforcement agents who are experienced in interview tactics. He used those\ntactics so successfully that he was undetected in his methods and obtained all the\ninformation he wanted.\nEric also seemed to have an excellent grasp of and ability to use infl uencing tac-\ntics. Probably one of the most noticeable in the attack was when he asked the police\noffi cer to call back to get a diff erent DMV agent. Th is was probably annoying for\nthe offi cer, but what made the tactic successful is that Eric “gave” the offi ce some-\nthing fi rst. Th at is, he “verifi ed” the data the offi cer needed and when he was sup-\nposed to give the offi cer fi nal piece of info is when the “computer” froze.\nApplying some rules of influence Eric was easily able to get the officers to\ncomply.\nClosely linked to Eric’s pretext was his ability to use framing successfully. To\nrefresh your memory, framing is bringing the target inline with your thinking by\npositioning yourself and your stories to make them believable. It is an important\npiece of the pretext puzzle that makes you stand out and prove to the target you\ncertainly are who you say you are. Eric’s pretexts were great and believable, but what\nreally sold them were the frames that he used. His frame changed depending on\nwho he was talking to. At one point he had to make sure the offi cer on the other end\nwould give him the Teletype number; on the other call he had to be a knowledgeable\nand skilled DMV agent.\nEric made himself believable using framing by assuming he would get the infor-\nmation he asked, showing no fear in his dealings, and confi dently asking for infor-\nmation he “felt” he was owed. All these attitudes framed the target to accept his\npretext and allow for natural responses.\nAs you can see, you can learn much by analyzing Eric’s social engineer attack.\nOne can only assume that Eric either had practiced all these methods or had a few\ndry runs to know all he did about the internal systems used in the attack.",

    "text": "306 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nEric’s methods worked out for him and were successful, but I would have taken\na couple extra precautions. For example:\n» When he was fi elding DMV calls, I would have made sure I forwarded\nthe number only when I was in the “offi ce.” I would have set up an offi ce\narea with some background offi ce noises and had the proper supplies to\ntake down all the information I needed to avoid the risk of a waitress or\nfriend blowing my cover.\n» Although a disposable cell phone is a good idea for tracing purposes,\nanother technique is to have that number forward to a Google Voice or\nSkype number. I tend not to trust cell signals, and nothing could have\nruined the gig faster than having the call drop or having a weak, static-\nfi lled signal.\nBesides these items one can’t improve much in this hack. Eric did a superb job at\nmaking sure it was done right by using many of the talents and skills in the frame-\nwork to accomplish his goal.\nMitnick Case Study 2: Hacking the Social\nSecurity Administration\nMitnick mentions a man he called Keith Carter, a less-than-honorable private\ninvestigator hired to do some digging into a man who was hiding funds from his\nsoon-to-be-estranged wife. She had funded his venture, which had grown into a\nmultimillion-dollar company.\nTh e divorce was almost settled but the woman’s attorneys needed to fi nd the\n“hidden assets.” Th is attack vector is interesting because, as in the fi rst case study,\nthe story follows a very shady method of gathering intelligence.\nThe Target\nTh e target was to fi nd the assets of the husband, “Joe Johnson,” but that wasn’t the\ntarget used for the actual social engineering attack. To obtain information on Joe, the\nprivate investigator, Keith, had to hack the Social Security Administration (SSA).\nMany times in a social engineering audit this option will present itself. Th is sec-\ntion covers some of the methods he used to accomplish this goal, but suffi ce it to\nsay that hacking the SSA is a very slippery slope. As the story unfolds you will see\nhow dangerous this particular hack was.\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 307\nThe Story\nJoe Johnson was married to a very wealthy woman. He had knowingly used tens\nof thousands of her dollars to invest in one of his ideas. That idea grew into a\nmultimillion-dollar organization.\nAs things happen, their marriage was not too solid, so they decided to divorce.\nDuring the divorce proceedings, soon to be ex–Mrs. Johnson “knew” he was hiding\nhis money, trying to keep it out of the divorce settlement.\nShe hired Keith, the private investigator who was a less-than-ethical guy who\ndidn’t mind riding the edge of what was legal and what was not to obtain the infor-\nmation he needed to make the case.\nAs Keith sat down to analyze the case he determined that a good starting point\nwas the Social Security Administration. He thought that if he could just obtain\nJoe’s records he would be able to fi nd some discrepancies and then nail his coffi n\nshut. He wanted to be able to freely call Joe’s banks, investment fi rms, and off shore\naccounts pretexting as Joe. To do so he needed some detailed information, which\nis what led him to the path of hacking the Social Security offi ce.\nKeith began with basic information gathering. He went online and found a guide\ndescribing the SSA’s internal systems and their internal terminology and jargon.\nAfter studying that and having the jargon down pat he called the local public num-\nber of the Social Security offi ce. When he got a live person he asked to be connected\nto the claims offi ce. Th e conversation went like this:\n“Hi, this is Gregory Adams, District Offi ce 329. Listen, I am trying to reach a\nclaims adjuster who handles an account number that ends in 6363 and the number\nI have goes to a fax machine.”\n“Oh, that is Mod 3, the number is…”\nReally? Th at easy? Wow. In a few moments’ time he gets the number of the inter-\nnal offi ce phones that the public normally cannot get. Now comes the hard part.\nHe has to call Mod 3, change his pretext, and obtain useful information on Joe.\nTh ursday morning comes around and it looks like Keith has his plan well laid out.\nHe picks up the phone and dials the Mod 3 number:\n“Mod 3. Th is is May Linn Wang.”\n“Ms. Wang, this is Arthur Arondale, in the Offi ce of the Inspector General. Can\nI call you ‘May’?”\n“It’s ‘May Linn’,” she says.\n“Well, it’s like this, May Linn. We have a new guy who doesn’t have a computer\nyet, and right now he has a priority project to do so he’s using mine. We’re the\n308 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ngovernment of the United States, for crying out loud, and they say they don’t\nhave enough money in the budget to buy a computer for this guy to use. And\nnow my boss thinks I’m falling behind and doesn’t want to hear any excuses, you\nknow?”\n“I know what you mean, all right.”\n“Can you help me with a quick inquiry on MCS?” he asked, using the name of\nthe computer system for looking up taxpayer information.\n“Sure, what do you need?”\n“Th e fi rst thing I need you to do is an alphadent on Joseph Johnson, DOB 7/4/69.”\n(Alphadent means to have the computer search for an account alphabetically by\ntaxpayer name, further identifi ed by date of birth.)\n“What do you need to know?”\n“What’s his account number?” Keith asks (this is Joe’s Social Security number\nhe is asking for).\nShe read it off .\n“Okay, I need you to do a numident on that account number.” (Numident is simi-\nlar to alphadent, only it’s a numerical search instead of an alphabetical one.) Th is\nwas a request for her to read off the basic taxpayer data, and May Linn responded\nby giving the taxpayer’s place of birth, mother’s maiden name, and father’s name.\nKeith listened patiently while she also gave him the month and year Joe’s Social\nSecurity number was issued, and the district offi ce it was issued by.\nKeith next asked for a DEQY (pronounced “DECK-wee”; it’s short for “detailed\nearnings query.”)\n“For what year?”\n“Year 2001.”\nMay Linn said, “The amount was $190,286, and the payer was Johnson\nMicroTech.”\n“Any other wages?”\n“No.”\n“Th anks,” Keith said. “You’ve been very kind.”\nKeith then tried to arrange to call her whenever he needed information and\n“couldn’t get to his computer,” using a favorite trick of social engineers of always\ntrying to establish a connection so that he can keep going back to the same person,\navoiding the nuisance of having to fi nd a new mark each time.\n“Not next week,” she told him, because she was going to Kentucky for her sister’s\nwedding. Any other time, she’d do whatever she could.\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 309\nAt this point it seemed like game over. Keith had all the information he set out\nto obtain and now it was just a matter of calling the banks and off shore accounts,\nwhich, armed with the information he had, had now become a much easier task.\nA well-executed and truly awe-inspiring attack.\nApplying the SE Framework to the SSA Hack\nTh e SSA attack just described leaves your mouth ajar and eyes wide. You can learn\nmuch from this particular attack, which used the social engineering framework.\nKeith started the attack with information gathering. You are probably really tired\nof hearing me say this over and over again, but having information is truly the crux\nof every good social engineer attack—the more you have, the better.\nKeith fi rst found a truly amazing piece of intel on the Web, which dumbfound-\ningly enough, is still online at https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/.\nTh is link directs you to an online manual for Program Operations of the Social\nSecurity Administration. It contains abbreviations, lingo, and instructions as well\nas what SSA employees are allowed to tell law enforcement. Armed with this infor-\nmation, Keith knew what to ask, how to ask, and how to sound like he belonged, as\nwell as what information would raise red fl ags.\nAlthough the link provided a wealth of information, he decided to take his infor-\nmation gathering a step further using the pretext of an Inspector General Offi ce\nemployee and calling his local SSA offi ce. He really thought outside the box, by\nusing his local offi ce to obtain the internal numbers needed to complete his pretext\nas an internal employee.\nKeith switched pretexts a couple of times and did so masterfully. He was able\nto obtain much of the information he needed by using the online SSA manual to\ndevelop the right questions. Th is manual proved to be an elicitation developer’s\ndream. Armed with the right words and language, he sounded like he fi t right in. He\nbuilt rapport and a frame that fed the pretexts perfectly. Building rapport is not an\neasy task, but Keith did it well and in a way that indicated he was well practiced in\nthis technique. He used many infl uence tactics to make sure the target felt comfort-\nable and at ease. For example, he mixed obligation and reciprocation artfully. When\nhe was able to get May Linn on his side by describing the lack of good tools and the\nlack of support from his management, she felt obligated to help him out.\nHe also used keywords and phrases that commanded empathy and yet showed\nhis authority, such as “my boss is not happy with me,” which gives an indication that\nhe is in trouble and that the SSA employee, May Linn, can save him. People have a\n310 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nmoral obligation to save those in need. Not many can walk away when someone is\nasking for help, and May Linn couldn’t either. She felt compelled to not only help,\nbut to even tell Keith about her personal schedule.\nIn the end, Keith used a number of important skills in the framework that do\nnot involve personal onsite, in-person action.\nTh e fact that governmental systems are run by people make them fallible to the\nhacking methods used in this story. Th is is not an argument for the invention of\nrobotic or computerized systems to do these jobs; it merely points to the fact that\nmany of these systems rely so much on overworked, underpaid, overstressed people\nthat manipulating them is not a very hard job.\nTo be honest, improving upon this particular attack is diffi cult because it is not\none I would ever perform myself and Keith did a superb job of applying the prin-\nciples of the framework.\nSo many people are used to being mistreated, abused, and yelled at that a little bit\nof kindness can make them go to extraordinary heights to help out. Th is particular\nattack as relayed in Mitnick’s Th e Art of Deception shows how vulnerable systems\nthat rely on people truly are.\nHadnagy Case Study 1:\nThe Overconfident CEO\nMy experience with an overconfi dent CEO is interesting because the CEO thought\nhe would be impervious to any social engineering attempt for two reasons: First,\nhe did not utilize technology much in his personal life, and second, he felt that he\nwas too smart and protected to fall for what he called “silly games.”\nWith that being said to his internal security team they decided to ask me to\nfocus on him as the goal of the audit. Th ey knew that if he did fail the audit it\nwould be easier to get approval to implement many of the fi xes that would help\ntheir security.\nThe Target\nTh e target was a decent-sized printing company in the U.S. that had some propri-\netary processes and vendors that some of its competitors were after. Th e IT and\nsecurity teams realized the company had some weaknesses and convinced the CEO\nan audit was needed. In a phone meeting with my partner, the CEO arrogantly said\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 311\nthat he knew that “hacking him would be next to impossible because he guarded\nthese secrets with his life.” Not even some of his core staff knew all the details.\nMy job as the SE auditor was to infi ltrate the company to obtain access to one\nof the company’s servers where this proprietary information was held and retrieve\nit. Th e diffi culty, as the CEO had mentioned on the phone, was that the passwords\nfor the servers were stored on his computer and no one had access to it, not even\nthe security staff , without his permission.\nThe Story\nApparently, the way in would have to involve the CEO, which presented a challenge\nbecause he was ready and waiting for an infi ltration attempt. I started off as I did\nwith any gig—by information gathering. I researched the company using online\nresources and other tools such as Maltego. I was able to harvest information such\nas locations of servers, IP addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, physical\naddresses, mail servers, employee names and titles, and much more.\nOf course, I documented all this information in a fashion that made it easy to\nuse later on. Th e structure of the e-mail was important because as I searched the\nwebsite I saw that it was firstname.lastname@company.com. I could not locate\nthe CEO’s e-mail address but many articles listed his name (let’s call him Charles\nJones) and title on their site. Th is would be information a standard, non-informed\nattacker would be able to obtain.\nUsing the firstname.lastname@company.com format, I tried to send an e-mail\nto him. It didn’t work. I was actually disappointed at this moment, because I was\nsure that the e-mail method would yield a lot of juicy details.\nI decided to try a nickname for Charles, so I tried chuck.jones@company.com.\nSweet success! I had a verifi ed e-mail address. Now I just had to verify it was the\nCEO’s and not some other guy with the same name.\nI spent some more time on Google and Maltego to harvest as much information\nI could. Maltego has this great transform that allows me to search a domain for any\nfi les that would be visible to a normal search engine.\nI ran the transform against the company’s domain and was greeted with an\namazing number of fi les for my browsing. Maltego doesn’t stop with just providing\nfi lenames with this transform. Many fi les contain metadata, which is the informa-\ntion about the dates, creators, and other little juicy tidbits about the fi le. Running\nMaltego’s metadata transform showed me that the majority of these fi les were created\nby a “Chuck Jones.” Much of the content in the fi les talked about him as the CEO.\n312 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh is was the confi rmation I needed, but during my browsing one fi le had caught\nmy eye—InvoiceApril.xls. Upon reading that fi le I discovered it was an invoice from\na local bank for a marketing venture Chuck was involved in. I had the bank name,\nthe date, and the amount, but I didn’t have the event the company was a part of.\nI did a quick search of the bank website but because the event was six months\nearlier it was not listed on the site. What could I do?\nI decided to place a call to the marketing person from the bank:\n“Hi, this is Tom from [CompanyName]. I am trying to organize our books and I\nsee an invoice here from April for $3,500 as a sponsorship package. I don’t see the\nevent name—can you please tell me what that invoice was for?”\n“Sure, Tom,” she said and I heard some clicking noise in the background. “I see\nthat was the bank’s annual Children’s Cancer Fund Drive and you were part of the\nSilver Package.”\n“Th anks a lot; I am new here and I appreciate your help. Talk with you later.”\nI was beginning to see a picture of a possible attack vector that I could use,\nbut I needed some more research and I needed to make a very carefully planned\nphone call.\nI found a few articles on the Web about this fundraiser and how many companies\ncame from all over the community to support it with money for cancer treatment\nresearch. In addition, the more digging I did into the CEO the more I found out\nabout him. I had his parents’ names, his sisters’ names, pictures of his kids that he\nhas on Facebook, the church he went to when he lived near his parents, a review he\nwrote of his favorite restaurant, his favorite sporting team, his oldest son’s favorite\nsporting team and where he attended college, where his kids go to school, and the\nlist goes on and on.\nI wanted to fi nd out why the company donates to the Children’s Cancer Fund.\nAlthough many malicious social engineers exploit others’ emotions, and I realized\nI might have to go down that path as well, I wanted to know whether the fund was\nsomething he was involved in because one of his sons has cancer. I placed a call to\nthe marketing director of the company:\n“Hello, this is Tom from XYZ. I was hired by First National Bank in town to\ncall those who took part in the April Children’s Cancer Fund and I was wondering\nwhether I could take a few minutes of your time to get some feedback?”\n“Sure,” Sue, the marketing director, said.\n“Sue, I see that you were part of our Silver Package in April. Did you feel the\nmarketing you received was worth the price you paid?”\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 313\n“Well, this is something we do every year and it does get us a lot of press time\nin the local area. I guess I wouldn’t mind seeing a little more on the website for the\nSilver Package.”\n“Excellent; I will note that. Every year—yes, I can see you do this every year. I\nam wondering personally, with so many fundraisers out there why did you choose\nthis one?”\n“I know Chuck has always been particular to this one. He is our CEO and I think\nsomeone in his family battled cancer.”\n“Oh my; I am sorry to hear that. It isn’t his own children is it?”\n“No, I think a nephew or cousin. We didn’t really talk about it.”\n“Well, we certainly appreciate your donations and support.”\nI fi nished up with a few more questions and then left it at that, thanking her for\nher time, and we parted ways.\nI got the information I needed—it wasn’t one of his kids who had cancer. Again, I\nknew this wouldn’t stop a malicious social engineer, but I was very curious. Armed\nwith this information I was ready to plan my attack vector.\nI knew the CEO was originally from New York and his favorite restaurant was\na place called Domingoes. He would bring his kids in often for a Mets game and\nthen they would go eat at Domingoes.\nHe wrote some ratings on the place and talked about his top three favorite dishes.\nI knew his parents still lived close by and he visited often from some other things\nhe wrote on Facebook.\nI planned my attack vector to be a fundraiser for cancer research. It was for the\ntri-state area and for a small donation one’s name would be entered into a raffl e. Th e\nraffl e prize would be two tickets to a Mets game and a choice of three restaurant\ncoupons, one of which was Domingoes.\nI would pretend to be from New York myself, but relatively new, in case he threw\nthings at me I didn’t know.\nMy end goal would be for him to accept a PDF from me that would be mali-\nciously encoded to give me a reverse shell and allow me access to his computer. If\nhe did not use a version of Adobe that would allow me access, then I would try to\nconvince him to download a zip fi le and execute an enclosed EXE that would have\nthe malicious fi le embedded.\nI practiced the phone conversation I would use for my pretext, I tested my PDF\nand EXE fi les, and I had Google Maps open to the location of Domingoes so I could\ntalk about that area openly. After I had my computer ready and waiting to receive\nthe malicious payload from the victim, I was ready to place the call.\n314 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nI placed the phone call around 4:00 p.m., because I found out through the com-\npany website that the offi ce closes at 4:30 on Fridays. Because I wasn’t on the initial\nmeeting phone call to set up this audit, (my partner was), the CEO would not\nrecognize my voice.\n“Hello, is Mr. Charles Jones available?”\n“Sure one second.” Th e voice on the other end sounded tired and was ready to\ntransfer me.\n“Hello, Chuck speaking.”\n“Hello, Mr. Jones, my name is Tony from the Cancer Research Institute of\nAmerica. We are running an annual fund drive to support our research into can-\ncers that plague men, women, and children.”\n“Please, call me Chuck,” he interrupted.\nTh is was a good sign because he didn’t give me any excuses or try to end the\nphone call saying he was busy; he took it upon himself to personalize the conversa-\ntion. I continued, “Chuck, thank you. We are running a fund drive for companies\nwho supported cancer funds before and are asking for small donations of $50–$150\ndollars. Th e great part is that everyone who helps us out is being entered into a\ndrawing for two great prizes. If you win you get two tickets to a Mets game in NYC\nand then a free dinner for two at one of three great restaurants. We are giving out\nfi ve of those packages.”\n“Mets game, really?”\n“I know, if you don’t like the Mets the prize might not appeal to you, but the\nrestaurants are good.”\n“No, no, I love the Mets, that’s why I said that. I was happy.”\n“Well think about this—not only are you helping out a great research fund but\nyou get a good game in and you get to eat at Morton’s, Basil’s, or Domingoes.”\n“Domingoes! Really! I love that place.”\n“Ha, that is great. You know I just went there the other night for the fi rst time and\nhad their Chicken Portabella. It was awesome.” Th is was his third-favorite dish.\n“Oh, if you think that is good, forget it, you need to try the Fra Diablo. It is really\nthe best dish in there. I eat it all the time.”\n“I am going there again over the weekend, I will defi nitely try it out. Th anks for\nthe tip. Look, I know it is getting late. Right now I am not even looking for money, I\ndon’t take money over the phone. What I can do is send you the PDF; you can look\nat it and if you are interested you can just mail the check in with the form.”\n“Heck yeah, send it over.”\n“Okay just a couple questions. What is your e-mail?”\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 315\n“chuck.jones@company.com.”\n“If you can, open your PDF reader, click the Help menu and About, and tell me\nthe version number please.”\n“One minute; it is 8.04.”\n“Excellent; I don’t want to send you a version that you can’t use. Just one second\nwhile we are on the phone I am going to send this to you—okay, it’s sent.”\n“Great, thanks. I hope I win; I really love that place.”\n“I know; the food is good. Before I let you go, could you just check to see whether\nyou got the e-mail and let me know if it is working?”\n“Sure, I am logging out in about fi ve minutes, but I can check. Yep, it is here.”\nWhen I heard the sound of double-clicking, I looked over on my BackTrack computer\nsaw my malicious payload collector, Meterpreter (see Chapter 7), reacting. I was\nholding my breath (because this part never gets boring) and bam, the shell appeared.\nMy Meterpreter scripts changed the ownership to something like Explorer.exe.\nChuck then said, “Hmm, all I got is a blank screen. It’s not doing anything.”\n“Really? Th at’s odd. Let me check here.” What I was really checking was that I\nhad access to his drive and the ability to upload a reverse shell that would run on\nreboot in case he shut down. I said, “I am sorry, I don’t know what happened. Can\nyou give me a minute or do you need to go?”\n“Well I need to go empty this coff ee mug, so I will put the phone down and be\nback in a minute.”\n“Excellent, thanks.” Th at minute was all I needed to make sure I had unlimited\nand returning access to his computer. He came back.\n“Back.”\n“Well, Chuck, I’m really embarrassed but I don’t know what happened. I don’t\nwant to hold you up, so why don’t you go and I will e-mail this to you when I make\nyou another PDF. We can touch base Monday.”\n“Okay, no problem. Have a great weekend.”\n“You, too, Chuck.”\nWe parted ways and to my surprise and extreme joy his computer remained on\nand active. Yes, he kept everything in a secure drive that only he had access to, but\nin Word documents. I promptly downloaded those Word documents and within a\nfew hours I had access to the servers and printed out all the internal processes he\nwanted to protect.\nWe did touch base on Monday morning, not as Tony the fund-raiser, but as his\nsecurity consultants with printouts of his “secrets,” his passwords, and recordings\nof the phone calls that were made to him and his staff .\n316 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh is fi rst meeting after a successful attack is always fi lled with the client’s initial\nshock and claims that we used unfair tactics and personal weaknesses to gain access.\nWhen we explain that the bad guys will use the exact same tactics, the look of anger\nturns to fear, and that fear turns to understanding.\nApplying the SE Framework to the\nOverconfident CEO Hack\nAs in the previous examples, applying the case to the social engineering frame-\nwork and seeing what was good and what could have been improved upon can be\nbenefi cial.\nAs always, information gathering is the key to any social engineering eff ort, and\nthis particular story shows it. Information gathering from many sources—the Web,\nMaltego, the phone, and more—is what made this attack successful. Insuffi cient\ninformation would have led to a miserable failure.\nProper and plentiful information makes all the diff erence, even information I never\nneeded, like his church, and his parents’ and siblings’ names. Th ese things were useful\nto have in case I needed them, but what proved to be invaluable was the information\nfound about the e-mail naming convention and the fi les on the servers using Maltego.\nTh is was the pathway to getting my foot into door of this company.\nKeeping the information you fi nd cataloged into BasKet or Dradis, as discussed\nin Chapter 2, and ready to use is also important; otherwise, you just have a text fi le\nwith a jumble of information you can’t make use of. Organizing the information is\njust as important as gathering and using it.\nTh inking like a bad guy—that is, looking for ways to exploit the weaknesses and\ndesires of the target—isn’t a great part of the job, but if a professional auditor wants\nto protect clients, he will show them how vulnerable they are. Th e more information\nyou gather, the easier fi nding vulnerabilities becomes. You begin to see pathways\nthat can lead to success.\nDeveloping realistic pretexts and themes that will have the maximum eff ect also\ncontributes to an attack’s success. One must develop power questions and keywords\nto use that will attract the target. By gathering a lot of information I was able to\ndevelop good questions and a frame that involved keywords and neurolinguistic\n(NLP) power words, which I then used in infl uence tactics that I was fairly sure\nwould work.\nMy pretext had to change often, from calling the company’s vendors to calling\ninternal employees for information. I had to plan out each pretext, get into that\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 317\ncharacter, and successfully follow through. Th is, of course, took a lot of planning\nto make sure each pretext sounded right, fl owed properly, and made sense.\nPractice makes perfect. Before the attack was launched my partner and I prac-\nticed everything. I had to make sure the PDFs worked and that the vector made\nsense. I also had to have good enough knowledge to be believable to whatever target\nI was speaking to at the time.\nTh e importance of practicing cannot be understated. Practice enabled me to\nfi gure out what tactics would work and what wouldn’t, as well as ensure that I could\nstick to the plan and go with the fl ow, even if that fl ow was in a direction in which\nI wasn’t planning on going.\nIn hindsight, I discovered a couple small improvements that would have made\nthis attack more effi cient. For one, it is always a risk to rely solely on a malicious\nPDF; I should have set up a small website that mimicked the real cancer research\nwebsite and had the PDF on there. Both the website and the PDF could have been\nmalicious. Th is would have doubled my chances of success and given me backup\nin case one avenue failed.\nAnother large risk I took was that the CEO would leave his computer on when\nhe left the offi ce. If he did not, I would have had to wait till Monday to try to gain\naccess. To keep him at his computer, I should have had a “real PDF” with information\nin it he could read that I would send after the malicious PDF worked in exploiting\nhis machine. Th is would have kept him working at his machine long enough to\nmake good use of the exploit.\nTh is audit took about a week’s worth of time to investigate, gather, and organize\ninformation for, practice, and then launch. One week and this company’s secrets\ncould have been owned by its competitors or by the highest bidder. Read the story\na few times and try to understand the subtle methods used and the way the con-\nversations fl owed. Picking up on the voice, tone, and conversation pace is diffi cult\nin written form, but try to imagine yourself in this conversation and decide how\nyou would handle it.\nHadnagy Case Study 2:\nThe Theme Park Scandal\nTh e theme park scandal case was interesting to me because it involved some onsite\ntesting. I used many of the social engineering skills mentioned throughout this book\nand thoroughly tested them during this case.\n318 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nIt was also interesting because of the nature of the business and the potential for\na successful scam. If successful, the social engineer could potentially have access to\nthousands of credit card numbers.\nThe Target\nTh e target was a theme park that was concerned about having one of its ticketing\nsystems compromised. Where patrons checked in, each computer contained a link\nto the servers, client information, and fi nancial records. Th e park wanted to see\nwhether the possibility existed for an attacker to use malicious methods to get an\nemployee to take an action that could lead to a compromise.\nTh e goal wasn’t to get an employee in trouble, but rather to see what damage\nwould result from an employee check-in computer being compromised. In addition,\nthe goal was not to compromise the computers through hacking but through purely\nsocial engineering eff orts.\nIf such a compromise could occur, what were the ramifi cations? What data could be\nfound and what servers could be compromised? Th ey didn’t want to go deep, just really\nfi nd out whether the fi rst stage, a social engineering compromise, could work.\nTo fi gure out whether a successful SE attack was possible, I had to understand\nthe theme park’s processes and methods for checking in customers and what the\nemployees would and wouldn’t do at their terminals—or more importantly, could\nand couldn’t do.\nThe Story\nAs mentioned earlier, the goal for this particular job wasn’t really complex; I just\nhad to fi nd out whether the person behind the counter would allow a “customer” to\nget the employee to do something obviously not allowed. Before I could even think\nof what that was I had to understand their business.\nI browsed the park’s website and used Maltego and Google to research articles\nand other information about the organization. I also did some onsite research. I then\nwent to the park and went through the process of buying a ticket at the ticket counter.\nDuring this process I started a small conversation with the teller, and spent some time\nobserving the layout, their computer nodes, and other aspects of the “offi ce” area.\nTh is area was where I started to see a clear picture. During the conversation I\nmentioned I was from a small town with a huge name. When she asked where, and\nI told her, she issued the normal response:\n“Where the heck is that?”\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 319\n“Do you have Internet access here?”\n“Yeah, I do.”\n“Oh you’ll love this. Go to maps.google.com and type in the zip code 11111, and\nput it on satellite view. Look how small that town is.”\n“Oh my gosh; that is tiny. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of this place before\ntoday.”\nIn this short amount of time I knew the following:\n» Th e layout of the space a teller has to work in\n» How employees check in each patron\n» Th at the computers have full web access\nI went back to the park’s website and started browsing with a new enlightenment\non their processes. I needed a way in to their computer systems. My pretext was a\nreasonable one—I was a father who was going to take his family to the theme park\nfor the day.\nMy story was that the family and I didn’t have plans to do it, but we came to the\nhotel and were browsing the web for things to do and saw a great discount for the\npark. We went down to the lobby and inquired about getting tickets but the price\nwe were given there was substantially more than what we saw on the web.\nWhen we double-checked the price we had found, we discovered it was a web-\nonly price. We paid and then realized the tickets needed to be printed so they can\nbe scanned. I tried to get the hotel to print them but the printer was down. I had\nalready paid and was nervous about losing the tickets so I printed them to a PDF\nand then e-mailed them to myself. Sounds like a reasonable story, doesn’t it?\nOne more step was needed before I could launch my evil plot. I had to make a\nquick phone call:\n“Hello, is this XYZ Th eme Park main offi ce?”\n“Sure is; how can I help you?”\nI needed to get to an internal offi ce person to ask my question and make sure I\nhad the right answer. After requesting the purchasing department, I was directed to\nthe right person. I said, “Hi, my name is Paul from SecuriSoft. We are giving away\na free trial of a new software to read and even print PDFs. I would like to send you\nthe URL for the free download, is that okay?”\n“Well, I’m not sure whether we are interested, but you can send me some\ninformation.”\n“Okay; excellent. Can I ask what version of Adobe you use now?”\n“I think we are still on 8.”\n320 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n“Okay; I will send you out a comparative information packet today.”\nArmed with the version information, all I needed to do was create a malicious\nPDF embedded with a reverse shell (which would give me access to their computer\nonce they opened the PDF), call it Receipt.pdf, and then e-mail it to myself.\nTh e next day I roped my family into a little social engineering action. As they\nstood off in the distance I approached the woman behind the counter and started\na friendly conversation.\n“Hi there, how are you…Tina?” I said, reading her name tag.\n“Doing okay, what can I help you with?” she said with a friendly customer service\nsmile.\n“See, we decided to take a little weekend getaway trip and I am at the Hilton over\nhere with my family,” I say, pointing to my beautiful family a few feet away. “My\ndaughter saw the ad for your theme park and begged us to come. We told her that\nwe would take her. We found a great deal on tickets on the website…”\n“Oh, yes, our web-only deal—very popular right now. Can I have your tickets?”\n“Yeah, you see this where I need your help so I don’t get the ‘Loser Dad of the\nYear’ award.” My nervous laughter was covered by her smile. I explained, “Tina, I saw\nthat deal and my wife and I said, let’s save the 15% and we bought the tickets at the\nhotel computer. But after I got done paying, I couldn’t print them because the hotel\nprinter was down. But I was able to save it as a PDF and I e-mailed it to myself.\nI know this is an odd request but would you log into my e-mail account and print\nit out for me?” Now this account was a generic one fi lled with e-mails titled “Pictures\nof the kids,” “Dad and Mom’s Anniversary” and things like that.\nI could tell she was really struggling with this decision and I was unsure whether\nthe silence would be to my benefi t or if I should help her to think it through. I said,\n“I know it is a weird request, but my little girl is just dying to go and I hate to tell\nher ‘no.’” I point again to my daughter who was doing a great job at being cute but\nimpatient.\n“Okay, how do I do it?”\n“Go to gmail.com, log in with Paul1234@gmail.com and a password of B-E-S-\nM-A-R-T.” (I know, using this password is terrible in a way, but a little last-minute\nwarning never hurt. It went unfollowed.)\nMoments later Tina was double-clicking on my PDF and getting a blank screen.\n“Are you kidding me—did I print it out wrong? Wow, I am defi nitely getting the\nLoser Dad award now.”\n“You know what, sir? I feel so bad for you, what if you just paid for the adult tickets\nand I will let your daughter in for free today?”\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 321\n“Wow, that is so generous of you.” With a smile I forked over the $50 and thanked\nher for all her help and asked her to log out of my e-mail. We part ways with me\nhaving a happy daughter and the park having been compromised.\nMoments later my partner text messaged me and told me that he was “in” and\n“gathering” data for the report. After enjoying a few hours of relaxation, we left the\npark to go back to work to compile the report for the Monday meeting.\nApplying the SE Framework to the Theme Park Hack\nInformation gathering, as shown in this case study, is not always majorly Web-\nbased; instead, it can be done in person. Th e juiciest information in this case was\ngathered during an in-person visit. Finding out what computer systems were used,\nfeeling out the target to know how he or she would react to certain questions, and\nknowing how the ticketing system worked were major components of the informa-\ntion gathering stage.\nTh e real takeaway from this particular hack is that a good pretext is more than\njust a story; it’s more than just some made-up costume and phony accent. A good\npretext is something you can easily “live” without too much eff ort.\nIn this scenario I was easily able to speak, act, and talk the father, because I am\none. My concern about being a “loser” dad was real, not made up, and comes across\nas real and then is transferred to the target as genuine. Th is makes everything that\nis said more believable.\nOf course, having a cute child in the distance looking longingly at the ticket lady\nhelped, and so did a believable storyline about a hotel printer not working. Chapter 2\ntouched on this, but sometimes a social engineer will promote that pretexting or\nsocial engineering in general is just basically being a good liar. I do not believe that\nis the case.\nIn a professional sense, pretexting involves creating a reality that will manipulate\nthe target’s emotions and actions to take a path you desire him to take. People are\nnot often motivated by a simple lie. A social engineer must “become” the character\nin the pretext for a gig, which is why using pretexts that are something you can\nclosely follow, live, and act with ease is a good idea.\nTh e pretext of the “free PDF software giveaway” had a lot of room for error. Th e\npretext was solid, but a quick rejection would have meant a couple-day lag in the\nnext attack attempt. It was also a “lucky guess” that the same version of Adobe\nwould be used companywide and that the particular teller I chose had not updated\n322 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nher particular version of Adobe Reader to the newest edition, which would have in\nessence nullifi ed my exploit attempts.\nBanking on inherent human laziness is not a gamble I usually like to take, but in\nthis case it worked out. Sometimes the best bet is to move forward as if what you\nare asking for is already a done deal. Th at attitude promotes a feeling of confi dence\nand comes across to the target that what you are saying or doing is legit.\nUsing words and phrases such as, “I really need your help…” is a powerful tool,\nas mentioned in Chapter 5. Humans inherently want to help each other, especially\nwhen asked.\nWhen asked, complete strangers will go to extraordinary lengths to “help out”\neven, as in this case, opening a unknown fi le from someone else’s email account.\nTh e plea to help a “poor dad” get his cute daughter into the park lead to a compro-\nmised system.\nOnce compromised, the software that stores all the credit card information for\neach guest was wide open to an attacker. Th e ability to collect that data with very little\neff ort could have left the park open to massive loss, lawsuits, and embarrassment.\nTop-Secret Case Study 1:\nMission Not Impossible\nEvery now and then my colleague and I are either involved in a situation or hear\nof a story that we would love to see turned into a movie, but for security reasons\nwe are not allowed to write about or even speak of it. For those reasons, I cannot\nmention who was involved or what was taken in the story that comes to us from a\nsocial engineer named “Tim.”\nTim’s goal was to infi ltrate a server that housed information that could be devas-\ntating if it fell into the wrong hands. Th e particular high-profi le company involved\nhad a lot to protect. When Tim was contracted to get this company’s information\nhe knew he would have to pull out all the stops; this job would test the very limits\nof his social engineering skills.\nThe Target\nTh e target is a high-profi le organization with certain corporate secrets that should\nnever be revealed to its competitors. Th ese secrets had to be guarded on servers that\ndid not have outside access and were only routable from the internal network.\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 323\nTim was contracted to help the company test its security against a “rogue per-\nson” being able to infi ltrate and walk out with the goods. Tim met one person from\nthe company at an off site location to sign the deal they worked out over the phone\nand e-mail.\nThe Story\nTim had a huge challenge in front of him. Th e fi rst stage, as with any social engineer-\ning gig, was the information gathering. Not knowing what information he would\nand wouldn’t use, Tim went full-bore, collecting information such as the e-mail\nlayout scheme, open requests for quotes, all employee names he could fi nd, plus\nany social media sites they belong to, papers they wrote and published, clubs they\nwere part of, as well as service providers they used.\nHe wanted to do a dumpster dive but when he scoped out the place he noticed\nthat security was very strong around the dumpster area. Many of the dumpsters were\neven enclosed in small walled areas, so he couldn’t see the logos on the dumpster\nunless he breached the perimeter. After fi nding out the department that handles\nwaste services, he decided to place a well-planned-out phone call to the company:\n“Hello, this is Paul from TMZ Waste Disposal. We are a new waste disposal\nservice in the area and have been working with some of the large corporations in\nthe area. I am part of the sales team that handles your region. Could I send you a\nquote for our services?”\n“Well, we are pretty happy with our present supplier, but you can submit a\nquote.”\n“Excellent; may I ask you just a few quick questions?”\n“Sure.”\n“How many dumpsters do you have?” asked Tim. After asking whether they used\nspecial dumpsters for paper and technology such as USB keys and hard drives, he\nthen laid on a few fi nishing touches.\n“What day is your normal pickup?”\n“We have two pickups per week; Set 1 is Wednesdays and Set 2 is Th ursdays.”\n“Th ank you. I can prepare this quote and have it sent over by tomorrow afternoon.\nWhat e-mail should I use?”\n“Send it to me personally at christie.smith@company.com.”\nAt this point a little friendly chitchat ensued and before you know it they were\nlaughing and exchanging pleasantries.\n324 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n“Th anks a lot. Hey, before we hang up can I ask you who you presently use? I like\nto do a comparative quote.”\n“Well, you know…” she hesitated, but then said, “Sure, we use Wasters\nManagement.”\n“Th anks Christie, I will make sure you are happy with the quote. We will talk\nlater.”\nArmed with this information, Tim went to the website for the present waste\nmanagement company and copied the logo to a JPG fi le. He then visited an online\nshirt printer and in 72 hours had a shirt with the logo in his hands. Knowing that the\ngarbage is picked up on Wednesday and Th ursday he wanted to go Tuesday night.\nHe then placed another call to the security department:\n“Hello, this is John from Wasters Management, your dumpster disposal people.\nI was called by Christie Smith’s offi ce stating that you have a damaged dumpster. I\nknow the pickup is on Wednesday so I wanted to come out and check it tomorrow\nnight. If there is a damaged unit I will have the truck bring out a new one. Is it okay\nif I come out Tuesday night?”\n“Sure, let me check—yes, Joe is on tomorrow. When you pull up just stop in the\nsecurity booth and he will give you a badge.”\n“Th anks.”\nTh e next day Tim wore his “company” polo shirt and had a clipboard. Th e pre-\ntext was genius because he knew the dates and internal names. Now, looking like\na company employee, he approached the security booth.\n“Joe, I’m John from Wasters and I called in yesterday.”\nTh e guard interrupted with, “Yes, I see your name right here.” He handed him a\nbadge and a paper map telling him how to get to the dumpsters. “Do you need one\nof us to tag along?”\n“Nah, I do this all the time.”\nTim was buzzed in and drove over to the dumpsters.\nArmed with a perfect pretext and a badge he had the time to do some digging.\nHe knew that Set 2 holds the non-food garbage, so he started his digging there.\nAfter just a little while he loaded a few hard drives, USB keys, some DVDs, and\nsome clear bags full of paper in his trunk. After about an hour or so he drove back\nout, thanked the security guys, and assured them all is good. Back at the offi ce he\ndug through the “garbage” and was greeted with some of the juiciest details he\ncouldn’t have found in his wildest dreams.\nMany times companies will dispose of hard drives and USB media by destroying\nthem completely. Th ey will erase all data and then send them to special disposal\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 325\nunits. Every now and then, though, employees who don’t think through their dis-\nposal procedures will just throw away a USB key they say is broken or a hard drive\nthat no longer boots. What they don’t realize is that there are many programs that\ncan strip data off of even non-bootable drives and media. Even if the media has been\nformatted, data can still be recovered in many situations.\nOne of the bags contained what looked like the contents of an offi ce. As he emp-\ntied the bag he noticed some papers that had not passed through the shredder. He\nsat down to read them and saw one was a contract for some IT services that went\nout for bid. Th e job was supposed to start in just a few days, but it looked like this\nparticular copy was used to sop up some spilled coff ee and then discarded.\nTh is would be a great fi nd, but he had so much more to search through. Th e\nDVDs were blank or unreadable, but surprisingly enough he located fi les on the\nUSB keys. From this information he discovered the names and private lines of the\nCFO as well as some other key personnel.\nTh e value of what he gathered was immense but I want to focus on what he did\nnext. Th e next morning, armed with the contract for the IT services in hand and\nknowing the type of work that was to be performed, he placed a call to the contract\npoint of contact during the lunch hour and prayed the contact was out to lunch.\n“Hello, is Sebastian available?”\n“No, he is out to lunch. Can I help you?”\n“Th is is Paul from XYZ Tech. I wanted to confi rm that our team will be coming\nto start the project tomorrow evening.”\n“Yes, just remember we can’t have any interruption of service so please do not\nget here any earlier than 5:30 p.m.”\n“Yes sir, you got it. See you tomorrow.”\nTh e next day Tim knew that he couldn’t arrive with the rest of the “team.” But if he\ntimed it right he would not be caught by the IT company or the target. Sitting across\nthe dark parking lot he watched the IT contract company arrive. After a good 30\nminutes he approached the front door and explained how he just ran out to get some\npaperwork from his car. He got buzzed in and now had free reign of the offi ce.\nHe needed to do some reconnaissance, and he figured the best way was to\napproach the IT company as one of the internal employees. He walked around\nuntil he heard some talking and found one of the guys in a shirt identifying him as\none of the IT team.\nArmed with the names of the upper-level management from the USB key fi les\nand from the point of contacts from the contract, he began, “Hi there, I’m Paul\nand I work Mr. Shivaz [the CFO]—did someone explain to you about the prod23\n326 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nproduction server ?” Tim had the server name from his information gathering; Tim\nknew that was the server he was attacking.\n“Yes, we know that server is off -limits in this work. Th e CFO explained to us the\nencryption and how we are not to mess with that server. No worries.”\nAfter a few more minutes of conversing, Tim had discovered some valuable\npieces of information:\n» Th e IT team is not to touch the server.\n» Th e server has full disk encryption.\n» Th e techs were “bragged” to by the in-house IT guy about how the target\ncompany use a keyfi le on a USB key that only the admins carry.\nTim knew this last point would make his task harder, and because the admins\nwere not in, he would not be able to access the server now. In addition, the physical\nsecurity around this server was very intense and may have been too hardened to\ntake the risk. He did know that the admins would have access to this server so he\nthought maybe he would try that avenue.\nHe visited the fi rst offi ce of the admin, but it was locked. He checked the second\noffi ce, then the third. Th e third one was shut but had not been closed all the way\nand it merely opened when he pushed a little. He was in.\nBy shutting the blinds and leaving the lights off , he felt he would be protected a\nbit from the potential of being caught. In his social engineer kit he carried a wide\nvariety of tools and clothing. One of the tools he always had with him on these\ntypes of gigs was a USB key that was loaded with a bootable Linux distribution such\nas BackTrack. In the BackTrack install is a preloaded version of Virtual Box, a free\nopen source virtual machine tool.\nHe loaded the admin’s computer, using a rear USB port, into BackTrack. After he\nwas in BackTrack, he connected to his own servers via SSH, set up a listener, then\nconnected back to it using a reverse shell he initiated from the admin machine. Th en\nhe started a keysniff er (to log all keystrokes typed on the computer) in BackTrack and\nset up the log fi le to be dumped through the SSH connection to his computer.\nTh en he did something truly pernicious. He opened Virtual Box and created a\nWindows virtual machine (VM), using the local hard drive as the physical media to\nboot from, and loaded the VM. Automatically, it loaded the admin’s user profi le and\nOS. At the login screen he loaded the VM to be in full screen mode, hid all bars, and\nmade the existing hot key to exit VirtualBox some ridiculously long combo. Th is pro-\ntects the user from mistakenly hitting that combo and revealing they are hacked.\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 327\nA risk still existed that he could be caught at any moment using this method\nof a rear USB key loading a virtual machine using their own hard drive, but if it\nworked he would get every keystroke the admin typed and a shell on the poor guy’s\ncomputer, giving Tim access to everything. Even though the shell would be on the\nvirtual machine, he would be logging all his keystrokes and then gain access to the\nvictim’s machine using his captured username and password.\nTim did a few other things in the offi ce such as set up a connection on another\nmachine, which gave him network access remotely. He also set up a remote listening\ndevice, the kind that uses a cell phone SIM card. He could call its number from any\nphone on earth and listen to conversations from anywhere in a 20-foot radius.\nAfter just a few hours Tim left the target’s company and went back to his offi ce. He\nwas excited to see whether this all worked, but he still had a few more ideas to try.\nEarly the next morning he made sure his remote connections were still alive and\nhe dialed into his listener to hear the early morning buzz of people coming into the\noffi ce. Th e anticipation built as he waited to see whether fi rst computer logs were\ncoming through, capturing the admin’s username and password.\nAbout one hour later Tim saw some logs coming through. He knew that he\ndidn’t want to do anything that would compromise his connection, so he waited.\nAround 12:15 the logs stopped, so he fi gured the admin must be at lunch. He quickly\nchecked his reverse shell and began to create a tunnel from the admin’s machine\nto the server back to his machine using the password he captured from the admin\nfor the server\nAfter the tunnel was connected he made a mad dash to copy as much as he\ncould before 1:00 p.m. At that time he didn’t notice any logs, so he called into the\nlistener and overheard someone asking, “Do you know how long this meeting is\nsupposed to last?”\nFiguring the admin might be at a meeting he made another attempt at a larger\ntransfer. After about 30 minutes he noticed some activity so he stopped data collec-\ntion and decided to wait until later. He didn’t want to alert the admin to anything\nfi shy going on by slowing down his connection through a large transfer. He started\nto sift through what he grabbed from the server, knowing he hit the jackpot.\nHis job wasn’t over yet. Th at evening he did one more massive transfer, taking\nas much as he could get and then headed over to the company’s offi ce again, social\nengineering his way in as he did before. Once in he headed over to the admin’s offi ce,\nwhich was locked this time and pulled shut: he used a shove knife (see Chapter 7)\nto get in:\n328 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nOnce inside he turned off the virtual machine, then rebooted the machine after\nremoving the USB key, and then he left the admin’s offi ce the way he found it. He\ncollected his listener and made sure his tracks were covered.\nHe exited the building to go back to his offi ce and compile his fi ndings. Of course,\nat the report meeting he walked in with a stack of printed documents and a hard\ndrive full of what he was able to copy. Th is was enough to drop the jaws of every\nperson in the room.\nApplying the SE Framework to Top Secret 1\nTh is story off ers many lessons. It is an example of a perfect social engineer. It can be\nsummed up as practice, preparation, and, of course, information gathering. All the\nskills he used we can imagine he practiced, from using a shove knife and creating\ntunnels to eff ective pretexting and information gathering.\nI cannot reiterate enough the importance of information gathering. I know I have\nsaid it a thousand times, but this whole deal would have fallen through without Tim\nhaving the appropriate information.\nBeing prepared through phone calls and onsite visits, and having the right hard-\nware, led to success. Analyzing this hack, you can see some of the fundamental\nprinciples of social engineering at play.\nTim was a master at information gathering, using web resources to pull up all\nsorts of nuggets, expert elicitation skills while on the phone, as well as masterful\npersuasion skills in person. Th ese techniques allowed him to gather data that prob-\nably would have been left behind by an unskilled hacker.\nInformation gathering gave Tim the foundation for what types of pretexts and\nquestions to develop.\nTh e dumpster dive was planned with surgical precision. Does a chance exist that\nhe would have been let in without the shirt and appointment? Sure. Yet how much\nmore powerful was the way he did it? He never left a doubt in their minds and he\nenabled each person he interacted with to go about their business and never think\ntwice. Th at is a perfect pretext, when a person can interact with you without any\nred fl ags or warning signs going up. Tim did that and it gave him freedom to move\naround as if he belonged.\nTh e best part of the story is what happened after he got in the building. Such\na large margin for error existed, and he could have been caught so many ways.\nSure he could have run in, grabbed the data off the server, and left, and probably\nno one would have stopped him, but doing it the way he did meant the company\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 329\nnever knew how their secrets got out and would never have known they were\ncompromised.\nTim took a huge risk when he left the admin’s computer running a VM. Th at\nparticular maneuver could have failed in many ways. If someone had ever rebooted\nthe computer or it had crashed, or if by mistake the admin pressed that crazy key\ncombo, it could have spelled the end to the hack and alerted the company that it\nhad been compromised.\nI might have taken a diff erent, less-risky route, one where I could have created a\nreverse tunnel from his computer back to my servers using a custom EXE that would\nnot be detected by antivirus software and in the startup scripts of the computer,\nsomething with less chance of failure, but Tim’s method had the fl air of being a\nvery sexy social engineering hack.\nProbably more than one lesson can be learned from this particular hack, but\nif anything, the old hacker adage of “trust no one” can be applied to some extent.\nIf someone calls to say that Christine authorized a dumpster inspection and you\ndidn’t hear it from her or a memo, call her and ask. Turn your computers off at night\nand defi nitely make your important machines not able to boot from USB without\na password.\nSure, these extra precautions will mean more work and longer load times.\nWhether they’re worth doing depends on how important the data that sits behind\nthose machines is. In this case, the data was able to ruin this company, so the\nprotection should have been extreme. Although the company took many excellent\nprecautions, like using full disk encryption, cameras, biometric locks, and so on\naround the server area, it did not secure the computers that had access to the most\nimportant data, and that is what led to the company’s demise.\nTop-Secret Case Study 2:\nSocial Engineering a Hacker\nTh inking outside the box and having to think fast is standard fare for a social\nengineer, so it is rare to be in a situation that will challenge the professional social\nengineer to the point of being stumped. What happens when a penetration tester\nis called on to put on a social engineering hat without prior warning?\nTh is next account shows exactly what happens when this situation arises. It is a\ngood example of how having certain social engineering skills practiced beforehand\ncan be very useful when called on to use them without warning.\n330 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nThe Target\n“John” was called on for a standard network penetration test for one of his bigger\nclients. It was a no-thrills pentest as social engineering and onsite work were not\nincluded in the audit outline. Still, he enjoyed the work of testing out the vulner-\nabilities on his clients’ networks.\nIn this particular pentest nothing really exciting was occurring. He was doing\nhis normal routines of scans and logging data and testing out certain ports and\nservices he felt might give him a lead inside.\nNear the end of a day he ran a scan using Metasploit that revealed an open VNC\nserver, a server that allows the control of other machines in the network. Th is is\na nice fi nd, because overall the network was locked down so this sort of easy-in is\nespecially welcome.\nJohn was documenting the fi nd with the VNC session open, when suddenly in\nthe background the mouse started moving across the screen. Th is was a huge red\nfl ag, because with this client at this time of the day, no user would be connected\nand using the system for a legitimate purpose.\nWhat could be happening? He noticed that instead of acting like an admin or\nnormal user, this person appeared to be not very knowledgeable about the system.\nHe suspected there was an unwanted intruder in the network. He didn’t want to\nscare the intruder away but he wanted to know whether he was an admin or another\nhacker who found his way into the very same system.\nQuickly the target went from being the company he was hired to pentest to a\nrogue hacker inside the organization.\nThe Story\nJohn decided quickly that he would have to social engineer this hacker and get as\nmuch information as possible to help safeguard his client. He didn’t really have time\nto think through every step and plan out properly. He didn’t have time to do the\nappropriate information gathering.\nHe takes a big risk and opens Notepad. Quickly he develops the pretext that he\nis a “n00b” hacker, a newbie, someone unskilled, and he found this box open and is\nhacking it, like this guy. He was able to obtain some screenshots of the conversation.\nTake a look and notice how the pentester had to social engineer the hacker, as shown\nin Figure 8-1. John starts the conversation and every other line is the hacker.\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 331\nFigure 8-1 An actual screen shot of the event.\nFollowing is the verbatim transcript of the conversation that took place. It is long,\nand all typos and jargon appear in the original, but the transcript shows exactly\nwhat transpired in this hack. John speaks fi rst.\n»\nwhats up?\n»\nhehe, just looking around\n»\nyeah, me too. Anything good?\n»\nyou’re a “hacker” too? U was just looking for unsecured VNC\nservers\n»\nU=I\n»\nI was looking forsomething easy. this was easy. ;) You see\nanything else on this network? This is the only one I got.\n»\nDidn’t find anything else of interest here, most is secured\npretty good. Yeah, easy to gain access, but I want admin\npriviliges... :D\n»\nYeah, would be easy from here. Just a priv elev. I am interested\ninwhat else is here. What is this spreedsheet that is always up?\n332 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n»\nI have no idea, it was heere when I logged in, I havn’t been\naround much. Found this computer 2 hours ago maybe. What\nabout you?\n»\nI had it for about a week. Off and on. Just did not do any-\nthing with it. Sort of lazy. What was your test file from rapid\nshare?I just dumped strings on it and don’t reconize anything.\n»\nCool. Well, the file was just a test i made, was trying to\nsee if I could get a server (trojan) running. But the fire-\nwall didn’t allow it.\n»\nlol. I had the same problem. I did metasplit shell and\nno-go. Thats why I kept using this. You in the us? or out of\ncountry? I know some people in denmark.\n»\nI’m from Norway actually, hehe, I have relatives in Denmark.\n»\nYou hang in any boards? like I used to like some but they\nhave been going away\n»\nI mostly hang in some programming boards, but not much else.\nHave you been into hacking for a long time or what? What’s\nyour age btw? I’m 22.\n»\nI have been on this for like fun for around a year or so. Still\nin school. 16. Just something to do. You ever go to evilzone?\n»\nHaven’t been there. I too mostly do this for fun, just try-\ning to see what I can do, test my skills. I wrote the “VNC\nfinder” myself btw, I have found a lot of servers, but this\nis the only one where I could actually have some fun\n»\nWow. What did you write it in? Can I dl it? Do you have a\nhandle?\n»\nIt’s written in a language called PureBasic, but it’s kinda\nnot ready for release yet, it’s only for my own use. But\nmaybe I can share it anyway, I could upload the code some-\nwhere and let you compile it. That is if you can find some\nPureBasic compiler on some warez site :P\n»\nThats cool. you can put it in that pastebin site from irc.\nThat lets you anon post I have not done purebasic before.\njust python and perl\n»\nLet me see, I’ll look for that pastebin site and upload it,\njust give me some minutes, I’ll be around.\n»\nOk cool! do you have a handle?I I go by jack_rooby\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 333\n»\nHandle, for what? I don’t chat on irc much or anything like\nthat, but I could give you an email you could reah me on.\n»\nThats cool. I mean handle like for irc and boardz and the\nsuch. heay e-mail works too.\n»\nYeah, at the programming board I share my full name,\netc. Maybe not too smart to share just yet. My email is:\nintruder@hotmail.com\n»\nSend me a message or whatever and I can add you on msn maybe.\n»\nI will send you a note. It is good to have someone that can\nprogram to know for this sort of stuff for when I get stuck\nor find something good\n»\nHehe, yeah, we could be a team :P\n»\nCool! let me know when you did the pastebin\n»\nhttp://pastebin.ca/1273205\n»\nbtw... that is kinda very in the “alpha” stage, the GUI is\nnot really finished. but it can be configured through some\nviariables.\n»\nCool. I will test it and see what I can do with it. Thanks\nfor sharing. if I do something cool, should I e-mail you?\n»\nYeah, please do. If you run this program for some hours you’ll\nfind a lot servers, I even tried to make some code to detect\nservers that has no security and even some that has a bug which\ncan let you log in even if it has a password. These servers\nwill show up in the result (the “found tab”) as “insecure”. But\nsometimes it does a mistake and says some are insecure which\nare not, but that’s not many, it’s just to test them.\n»\nWow. I saw some other vnc servers here too, but they all\nwanted passwords. Does your tool let us in to that?\n»\nJust a very few has the bug which can let you in, but you\nmust use the special client for them, more info here btw:\n»\nhttp://intruderurl.co.uk/video/\n»\nDownload the zip file.\n»\nOlol, k, soI wrry\n»\nsorry. Ok, I will dl that and have a look. Thats cool. Did\nyou write the backdoor from rapid share too? or did you get\nthat from someplace?\n334 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n»\nI try to write most of my tools myself, this way I learn. So\nyes, I wrote it myself, but it was not finished, I was just\nwanna see if I could run a server, but it didn’t doo any-\nthing yet, hehe.\n»\nI see. I sort of gave up, but I thought I would come back and\ntry some more.I figure there has to be some stuff around but I\ndon’t have a botnet of myown to use, this guy named Zoot54 tried\nto sell me one, and some people vouched for him, but I did not\ntrust him at all. And I don’t know how to write my own tools\nat all other then some perl and python which wont work for most\nwindows hosts like this so I have been tryingthe metasploit but\ngetting the firewall error. Do you have plans for this? Like\nsomething cool to do? or just moveon to the next?\n»\nPerl and python is a good start btw, I haven’t been using them\nmyself, but when you know some languages you can easily learn\nmore :P Maybe you should give PureBasic a try, it’s really easy\nactually. Hehe, a bot-net would be cool, I was thinking about\nmaking one, but it’s kinda hard to make it spread, at least on\nVista. But nah, I can’t give up this server just yet, I have to\ntry some more, there has to be a way to get more priviliges ;D\n»\nthast cool. You can have the server as I have had it for a\nwhile and don’t know what to do next. let me know what you\nare doing if you would so I can learn some more though. That\nwould be cool. Do you have a myspace or facebook or any-\nthing? Or just use the e-mail?\n»\nE-mail works for now, when I trust you more maybe I can add you\non facebook, I don’t have myspace. Yeah, I’ll keep you updated :)\n»\nCool that works for me. Do you have a shell or do you have\nthis same gui? Is it just a multi connection vnc?\n»\nYeah, I just used ThightVNC or whatever and made it not dis-\nconnect other users. I’m not a shell fan really, hehe :S\n»\nCool. When I get a shell a lot of times I makes mistake tand\ndissconnect on accident\n»\nGood you didn’t dissconnect me :D Btw, when I first saw you\nmessing around I was like “damn, the administrator is here”,\nhehehe...\n»\nHah, no I looked up the time zone and they are in the middle\nof the US so it is the middle of the night for them.\n»\nYeah, I did the same thing. Even did a speed test of the\ninternet connection, hehe.They seem to have faster upload\nspeed than download speed, weird... But handy for a DoD\nattack maybe.\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 335\n»\nDoS, i mean.\n»\nweird I woner what type of line it is its says it it from\nco. which I thought was a funny name.. Did you ever get any\nother systems here? I wonce saw a warez server but that was\na long time ago and it is gone now.\n»\nHaven’t found any other systems. But I would sure like to\naccess all these network computers they have... damn many,\nit’s some kind of university. Hehe, I printed out “hello\nworld” previous today.\n»\nHaha did you send it to a printer or to the screen? these\npeople would more then likkely freak out if they saw the\nmouse start mooving on them in the middle of the day whith\ntht weird spreadsheet\n»\nHaha, they probably woold, but what silly idiots runds a VNC\nserver without a password?! I printed to some of the print-\ners, I hope somebody saw it.\n»\nHaha thats is true, i bet som.. well they cant run it with\nout admin privs right? So it cant be just some user that did\nit, someone with admin would have to do it or else our back-\ndoors should work on it and they are not going at all. Or do\nyou think some one just changed the config?\n»\nHmm, well, i think you’re right, maybe some admin or prankster..\n»\nDo you do this work for a living? I keep hearing you can\nmake money with it, and I think if I do this for a while and\nget to be good I might be able to get a job with it. Is that\nwhat you did?\n»\nI have earned money on programming, but never on hacking or\nsecurity stuff. But that’s a good idea, people would pay to\nget their security tested and if we get good enough we could\nprobably earn a lot this way.\n»\nThats what I hope. I bought a book on the ethical hacker and\nthink that they have some good programs in there. I don’t\nknow what the age is to take the test, but if I do take it\nthat might be a good start to do this work. And there are\nsome good tools in there like the metasploit. You should\ntake a look at it if you have not yet.\n»\nYeah, thanks, I should check that out :) But I’m getting\na little tired now btw, hehe. Can’t sit here chatting in\nbloody notepad all day, hehehehe. So cya later man, cool\nmeeting you, very fun.\n»\nYeah I was scared when I saw the rapid share up on the screen.\nCool to meet you and I will e-maiul you and let you know how\n336 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nthe program works. Tht is exciting to try that out and see what\nhappens. You stay safe and don’t like the bad guys find you!\n»\nHehe, thanks, the same for you btw! :) This was interesting,\nI think I’ll save this notepad log btw, give me a sec,lol...\n»\nthere, lol, sorry\n»\ngoodbye\n»\nbye\nTh is chat reveals how quickly John had to pretext and become someone else.\nTh is is not an easy task, as usually it takes a lot planning, but to secure his client\nand fi nd out who this intruder was he had to play whatever role the “hacker” was\ngoing to put him in.\nIn the end, John ended up getting his picture, e-mail, and contact info. He\nreported this malicious hacker to his client and the problem was fi xed to not allow\nsuch free reign in and out of its systems.\nTh is top-secret case shows just how social engineering used in a professional\nsense can go a long way toward securing the clients.\nApplying the SE Framework to the\nTop Secret Case Study 2\nWhat I fi nd interesting in this account is how the company wasn’t really a target for\nthe hacker. He was merely scanning the Internet for “low-hanging fruit” and that\nis exactly what he found. Open machines with full access are dangerous and this\naccount shows just how much damage could have occurred if the pen tester was\nnot sitting there just at the right time.\nTh ere is, of course, a lot one can learn about social engineering from this story,\ntoo. John did not come into this project with the idea of using his social engineer-\ning skills. Instead it was a straight out pentest. Sometimes you are called on to use\nyour skills without being able to plan fi rst.\nWhat might have enabled John to be able to do this without having to go home\nand have a practice session? Most likely these skills were something that John used\ndaily or that he at least practiced often enough to make him agile in his use of them.\nTh e main lesson in this case study is probably practice makes perfect. Realistically,\nJohn could have confronted the hacker, told him he was an admin and that he was\nbeing logged, and that his life was over. All sorts of threats could have fl own back\nand forth and he could have tried to use fear as his main tactic.\nCASE STUDIES: DISSECTING THE SOCIAL ENGINEER 337\nMost likely, the hacker would have fl ed the scene only to return later and try to\nformat the system or do even more damage to cover his tracks. Instead, thinking\nvery fast, John was able to farm a lot of usable information on his target. John later\nused the target’s e-mail address and name and a good copy of Maltego to get a very\nclear picture of this individual’s activities.\nAnother minor lesson one can learn from analyzing this story is how to be fl uid.\nWhat I mean by that is learning to go with the fl ow. When John started “gather-\ning information” from the hacker he really didn’t know whether this person was a\nhacker or an admin. John’s fi rst line, “Hey what’s up,” could have been answered by\nthe attacker in many ways. Without knowing exactly the response he would get,\nJohn had no time to really prepare. He had to try to use lingo and react the way he\nimagined a hacker would.\nJohn took it even a step farther. Realizing that the best avenue was a submissive\none, John put on the pretext of a “n00b,” or new hacker who didn’t know much and\nwanted a wonderful and intelligent real hacker to educate him. Feeding into the\nhacker’s ego, John got him to spill his guts about all sorts of things, including all his\ncontact information and even a picture.\nWhy Case Studies Are Important\nTh ese case studies are just a few of the stories that are out there, and these are by far\nnot the scariest. Every day governments, nuclear power plants, multibillion-dollar\ncorporations, utility grids, and even whole countries fall victim to malicious social\nengineering attacks, and that doesn’t even include the personal stories of scams,\nidentity theft, and robbery that are occurring by the minute.\nAs sad as reading all these stories is, one of the best ways to learn is by reviewing\ncase studies. Experts from all fi elds utilize this methodology. Psychologists and doc-\ntors review countless hours of tapes and interviews to study the microexpressions\npeople use when feeling certain emotions.\nPersuasion experts review, analyze, and study accounts of positive and negative\npersuasion. Doing so helps them to pick up on the subtle areas that aff ect people\nand see how they can be used to learn and to protect their clients.\nLaw enforcement reviews case studies as part of their everyday lives to learn what\nmakes a criminal tick. Along those lines, criminal investigators analyze and dissect\nevery aspect of a malicious person, including what he eats, how he interacts with\nothers, what he thinks about, and what makes him react. All of this information\nhelps them to truly understand the mind of the criminal.\n338 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh ese same methods are how professional profi lers target and catch the “bad\nguys.” In the same fashion, professional social engineers learn a lot by studying\nnot only their own case studies but also cases in their own practice and malicious\naccounts they can fi nd in the news. By reviewing case studies a social engineer\ncan truly start to see the weakness of the human psyche and why the tactics in the\nsocial engineering framework work so easily. Th at is why I have been working hard\nto make sure the framework on www.social-engineer.org will include updated\nweb stories and case studies that you can use to enhance your skills.\nIn the end, all of these exploits worked because people are designed to be trusting,\nto have levels of compassion, empathy, and a desire to help others. Th ese are qualities\nthat we should not lose as we have to interact with our fellow humans every day.\nYet at the same time, these qualities are the very things that are more often than\nnot exploited by malicious social engineers. It may seem that I am promoting each\nof us to become a hardened, emotionless creature that walks around like a robot.\nAlthough that would defi nitely keep you protected from most social engineering\nattempts, it would make life dull. What I am promoting is being aware, educated,\nand prepared.\nSummary\nSecurity through education is the mantra of this book. Only when you are aware\nof the dangers that exist, only when you know how the “criminal” thinks, and only\nwhen you are ready to look that evil in the eye and embrace it can you truly protect\nyourself. To that end, the fi nal chapter of this book discusses how to prevent and\nmitigate social engineering attacks.",
    "question": "What are the key methods and techniques used in the social engineering hacks described in the case studies, and how do they highlight the vulnerability of systems that rely on human interaction?",
    "summary": "The text discusses three case studies of social engineering attacks, highlighting the importance of information gathering, realistic pretexts, and exploiting human weaknesses. In the first case, a private investigator used social engineering to gain access to the Social Security Administration by impersonating an Inspector General and obtaining sensitive data. In the second case, an overconfident CEO was tricked into revealing information through a well-crafted pretext involving a cancer fundraiser. The third case involved a hacker who gained access to a company's server by exploiting a dumpster dive and using a USB key to create a virtual machine. The text emphasizes that social engineering relies on human psychology, and that understanding these principles is key to both defending against and preventing such attacks."

    "text": "9\nPrevention and\nMitigation\nT\nhe preceding chapters show you all the methods and ways that social engi-\nneers trick and scam targets into divulging valuable information. They also\ndescribe many of the psychological principles that social engineers use to influence\nand manipulate people.\nSometimes after I give a speech or security training, people will look very para-\nnoid and scared and say something like, “It just seems there is no hope to even\nattempt security. How do I do it?”\nTh at is a good question. I promote having a good disaster-recovery plan and\nincident response plan because nowadays it seems that it is not a matter of “if” you\nwill get hacked, but “when.” You can take precautions to give you at least a fi ghting\nchance at security.\nSocial engineering mitigation is not as easy as ensuring hardware security. With\ntraditional defensive security you can throw money into intrusion detection systems,\nfi rewalls, antivirus programs, and other solutions to maintain perimeter security.\nWith social engineering no software systems exist that you can attach to your\nemployees or yourself to remain secure.\nIn this chapter I present the top six steps I tell my clients they can take to prevent\nand mitigate social engineering attempts:\n» Learning to identify social engineering attacks\n» Creating a personal security awareness program\n» Creating awareness of the value of the information that is being sought\nby social engineers\n» Keeping software updated\n» Developing scripts\n» Learning from social engineering audits\n340 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh ese six points all boil down to creating a security awareness culture. Security\nawareness is not about a 40-, 60-, or 90-minute program once every year. It is about\ncreating a culture or a set of standards that each person is committed to utilizing in\nhis or her entire life. It is not just about work or websites deemed to be “important,”\nbut it is the way one approaches being secure as a whole.\nTh is chapter covers the aforementioned six points and how creating a security\nawareness culture can be the best defense against a malicious social engineer.\nLearning to Identify Social\nEngineering Attacks\nTh e fi rst stage in social engineering prevention and mitigation is to learn about\nthe attacks. You don’t have to dive so deep into these attacks that you know how to\nrecreate malicious PDFs or create the perfect con. But understanding what happens\nwhen you click a malicious PDF and what signs to look for to determine whether\nsomeone is trying to trick you can help protect you. You need to understand the\nthreats and how they apply to you.\nHere’s an illustration: You value your home and the things in it, but especially\nthe people in your home. You do not wait to have your fi rst fi re to fi gure out how to\nplan, prevent, and mitigate its danger. Instead you install smoke detectors and plan\nout an escape route in case of a fi re. In addition, you might train your children with\nthe phrase to, “Stop, drop, and roll” if they are on fi re. You teach them how to feel\nthe door for heat and to stay low to avoid smoke inhalation. All of these methods\nare ways to prevent or prepare for a fi re before you have a real fi re and have to deal\nwith the devastation it brings.\nTh e same principle applies to protecting yourself and your company from social\nengineering attacks. Do not wait for the attack to occur to learn about how devas-\ntating they can be. Don’t think I’m self-serving, but I promote social engineering\naudits to regularly test your employees’ ability to withstand these attacks, and fol-\nlowing up with training.\nTeach yourself and your employees how to “stop, drop, and roll,” so to speak, when\nit comes to these types of attacks. What are the latest news stories on how social\nengineers are attacking companies? Knowing them can be a fi rst line of defense,\nthe same as knowing what a fi re can do to your home. Learn the diff erent methods\nthat modern social engineers and identity thieves use. You can fi nd an archive of\nnews stories and examples of social engineers, con men, identity thieves, and the like\nat www.social-engineer.org/framework/Social_Engineering_In_The_News.\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 341\nAnother good step is reading this book. It is full of all the methods and principles\nthat social engineers use to manipulate their targets. Th is book is more than just\na compilation of stories and wonderful hacks; it off ers an analysis of the thinking\nand tactics used by the malicious social engineer.\nAlso check out the videos on the www.social-engineer.org site, in the Resources\narea, which demonstrate exploits in action. Th e average user does not need to watch\nthem with the intent of understanding how to perform these attacks himself, but\nto understand how an SE performs the attack.\nBasically, the more you know about how these attacks occur, the easier you can\nidentify them in the “wild.” Being aware of the body language, expressions, and\nphrases used in an SE attempt will make your ears perk up when you hear or see\nsomeone utilizing these methods.\nYou don’t need to spend tons of time learning about SE methods. However,\nspending a few minutes now and then reading the news and reading stories on\nwww.social-engineer.org or other sites can help you see the methods being used\nnow against companies.\nAfter you have a good basis of knowledge and an audit under your belt, the next\nstep, creating a security-minded culture, will seem simple to develop.\nCreating a Personal Security\nAwareness Culture\nIn July of 2010 I was part of a small team of security professionals that held one of\nthe fi rst organized and professional-level social engineering contests at Defcon 18.\nSome of the best and brightest minds from around the globe come to Las Vegas,\nNevada, once a year to speak, teach, and learn.\nMy team and I decided it would be a great opportunity to hold a contest that\nwould showcase whether corporate America is vulnerable to this attack vector\n(responding to a “contest”). We organized the contest by having interested people\nsign up to take part in two stages of social engineering : information gathering and\nactive attacks.\nTo keep the contest legal and moral we did not want any person victimized, and\nno Social Security numbers, credit cards, and no personal identifying information\nwould be gathered. Our goal was not to get any of these people fi red. In addition our\ngoal was not to embarrass any particular company, so we decided also no passwords\nor other personal security–related information from the companies. Instead we\n342 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\ndeveloped a list of about 25–30 “fl ags” that ranged from whether the company had\nan internal cafeteria, to who handles its trash disposal, to what browser it uses, and\nto what software it uses to open PDFs. Finally, we chose target companies from all\nsectors of business in corporate America: gas companies, tech companies, manu-\nfacturers, retail, and everything in between.\nEach contestant was assigned one target company in secret, on which he had two\nweeks to do passive information gathering. Th at meant contestants were not allowed\nto contact the company, send it emails, or in any way try to social engineer information\nout of it. Instead they had to use the web, Maltego, and other tools to gather as much\ninformation as possible and enter all they found into a professional-looking report.\nFrom the information gathered we wanted contestants to develop a couple of\nplausible attack vectors that they thought would work in the real world. Th en con-\ntestants had to come to Defcon in Las Vegas, sit in a soundproof booth, and make a\n25-minute phone call to their target to implement their attack vector and see what\ninformation they could obtain.\nI could spend the next 20–30 pages telling you what happened at that contest and\nwhat the outcome was, but one thing we found was this: Every contestant obtained\nenough information out of the targets that the company would have failed a secu-\nrity audit. Regardless of the experience level of the contestant and the pretext, the\ncontestants were successful in accomplishing their goals. For a full report about\nthe CTF and what occurred, visit www.social-engineer.org/resources/sectf/\nSocial-Engineer_CTF_Report.pdf.\nNow on to what applies here—security awareness. Corporations that care about\nsecurity have programs where they train their employees how to be aware of poten-\ntial security risks via phone, Internet, or in person. What we found was that security\nawareness in those companies was at failure stage. Why? How could it be that these\nFortune 500 companies that spend millions or more on security, training, educa-\ntion, and services designed to protect their employees could be failing at security\nawareness?\nTh at is my point in the title to this section—security awareness is not personal\nto employees. Often in my professional practice when I talk with employees about\ntheir feelings about an attack they respond with something like, “It is not my data;\nwhat do I care?” Th is attitude shows that the security awareness that these compa-\nnies were trying to instill never hit home; it was not important, eff ective, and most\nimportantly, not personal.\nIn reviewing much of the material and methods available for so-called security\nawareness, what I have found is that it is boring, silly, and not geared to make the\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 343\nparticipant interact or think. Short DVD presentations that cover a ton of things in\na shotgun approach that blasts the participant with a lot of tiny little facts are not\ndesigned to sink in too deep.\nWhat I challenge you to do as a company or even as an individual is to create a\nprogram that engages, interacts, and dives deep into security awareness. Instead of\njust telling your employees why having long and complex passwords is a good idea,\nshow them how quickly one can crack an easy password. When I am asked to help\nperform security awareness training for a client, sometimes I ask an employee to\ncome up to my computer and type in a password that she feels is secure. I do this\nbefore I release any information about passwords. Th en as I start my presentation\non that section I start a cracker against that password. Usually within a minute or\ntwo the password is cracked and I reveal to the room the password that was secretly\ntyped into my computer. Th e immediate and drastic eff ect it has on each person has\nan extreme impact. But after numerous demonstrations like that employees will\ncomment on how they now understand how serious having a good password is.\nWhen I discuss the topic of malicious attachments in email, I do not have to show\nemployees how to craft a malicious PDF but I do show them what it looks like from\nboth the victim’s and the attacker’s computers when a malicious PDF is opened.\nTh is helps them understand that a simple crash can lead to devastation.\nOf course, this teaching method produces a lot of fear, and although that is not\nthe goal, it is not a terrible side product, because employees will remember it better.\nBut the goal is to make them think not just about what they do not only at work and\nwith their offi ce computers, but also their own bank accounts, home computers,\nand how they treat security on a personal level.\nI want each person who hears a security presentation or reads this book to review\nhow he interacts with the Internet as a whole and make serious changes to reus-\ning passwords, storing passwords or personal information in non-secure locations,\nand to where they connect to the Internet. I cannot tell you how many times I have\nseen a person sitting in the center of Starbucks on her free Wi-Fi checking a bank\naccount or making an online purchase. As much as I want to go up and yell at that\nperson and tell her how quickly her whole life can be turned upside down if the\nwrong person is sitting on that same network with her, I don’t.\nI want people who read this to also think of how they give out information over\nthe phone. Con men and scam artists use many avenues to steal from the elderly,\nthose having hard economic times, and everyone else. Th e phone still remains a very\npowerful way to do this. Being aware of the vendors’, banks’, or suppliers’ policies\non what they will and will not ask for over the phone can help you avoid many of\n344 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nthe pitfalls. For example, many banks list in their policies that they will never call\nand ask from a Social Security number or bank account number. Knowing this can\nsafeguard you for falling for a scam that can empty your life savings.\nCalling security awareness a “program” indicates that it is something ongoing.\nA program means you schedule time to continually educate yourself. After you\nobtain all this useful information, then you can use it to develop a program that\nwill help you to stay secure.\nBeing Aware of the Value of the\nInformation You Are Being Asked For\nReferring to the Defcon 18 social engineering contest again, in it we learned another\nvaluable lesson—when the information is perceived as having no or little value, then\nlittle eff ort is placed on protecting it.\nTh is is heavy-duty statement, but was proven true with how many targets will-\ningly handed over information on their cafeterias, waste removal, and so much more.\nYou must realize the value of the data that you have and be aware of a tactic a social\nengineer might use to reduce the value of this information in your eyes.\nBefore giving out information to someone, determine whether the person who\nis calling or interacting with you deserves it. Humans have this built-in desire to\nwant to help and to be helpful to those whom we perceive need it. It is a major\nway a social engineer manipulates a target into handing over valuable information.\nAnalyzing the person with whom you are interacting and determining whether\nshe deserves the information she is asking for can save you the embarrassment and\ndamage of falling victim.\nFor example, in the social engineering contest at Defcon one contestant had a\npretext that he was a customer of a major antivirus company. He called in with a\nserious problem—his computer couldn’t get online and he felt it was due to some-\nthing the antivirus was doing and wanted the technical support representation to\ndo one simple thing—browse to a website.\nMalicious SEs often use this attack vector. By driving a victim to a website embed-\nded with malicious code or malicious fi les they can gain access to a target’s computer\nand network. In the case of the contest, the website was not malicious at all, but it\nwas to show that if this were a malicious attack it would have been successful.\nTh e fi rst attempt was laid out like this by the contestant: “I cannot browse to my\nwebsite and I think your product is blocking me. Can you check by going to this site\nso I know for sure whether it is your software or not?”\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 345\nTh e technical support representative answered well by saying, “Sir, our product\nwould not block you from going to that site; it wouldn’t matter if I can go there or\nnot.” He declined the request.\nTh e contestant did not give up there; after talking a bit more he again tried, “I\nknow you said your product would not block the site, but it worked until I installed\nyour software, so can you please check for me?”\nAgain he was declined his request: “Sir, I am sorry for that inconvenience but\nagain our product would not block you and my going to the site will not help you\nfi x the problem.”\nIt seemed as if the request was going to be rejected for good when the contestant\ntried one last-ditch eff ort and said, “Sir, it would make me feel better if you would\njust try going to this site for me. Please, can you help me out?”\nTh is simple request put our technical support rep over the edge and he opened\nhis browser and went right to the site. He had the right idea, he even had the right\nsecurity awareness answer, but in the end he wanted his “customer” to “feel better”\nand honored his request. Th is could have led that company to a major pitfall if it\nwere a malicious attack.\nTh e technical support representative knew that this information was not relevant\nto that particular call. Like him, you must be determined to analyze whether the\ninformation being asked for is deserved and relevant to the person with whom you\nare interacting. Approaching this scenario from the other angle, what if the contes-\ntant were a legitimate customer and the rep had declined to go to that website—what\nis the worst that could have happened?\nTh e customer might have been a little upset at being declined the request he\nwanted but it still would not have changed the outcome. Th e product he had was\nnot the cause of his woes.\nA social engineer often uses charm to start a conversation about the weather,\nwork, the product, anything at all, and uses it to reveal the information sought.\nTh is is where a good security awareness policy comes into play—educating your\nemployees about what tactics might be used against them can save them from act-\ning out of fear.\nIn one audit the pretext I used was being the assistant to the CFO. Th e call\ncenter employees had a fear of losing their jobs for rejecting the requests from\nsuch a high-level management. Why? Th ey are not given the proper education to\nknow that rejecting that request would not cost them their jobs. At the same time\nprotocols should be in place for the employee to know when a request for informa-\ntion is proper.\n346 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nTh e perceived value of the information being asked for closely ties in with an\neducated and aware person knowing that even minor tidbits of data can lead to a\nmassive breach. Knowing that the person on the other end of the phone doesn’t really\nneed to know what the name of the food preparation company for the cafeteria can\nhelp an employee to answer appropriately. If you are an employer then help your\nemployees develop answers to these requests. In most cases a simple, “Sorry, I don’t\nhave that information; please contact our purchasing department if you want that.”\nOr “I’m sorry I am not allowed to divulge that information but you can send an\nemail to info@company.com to request some of this info,” can go a long way toward\nquashing many social engineering eff orts.\nI mentioned earlier that creating an atmosphere that makes information seem\nless valuable is also a tactic used by social engineers to get people to freely divulge\nthis “unimportant” information.\nUsing the contest example again, one contestant was asked to provide some\nidentifying information. His pretext was a company that was hired to do an inter-\nnal audit and when the target wanted to verify who he was he asked for something\noff of the requisition form. Our contestant pretended to lean over to an imaginary\nco-worker and said, “Jane, the gentlemen from Your-Target-Company wants the ID\nnumber from the requisition, can you do me a favor and grab it from Bill’s desk?”\nAs “Jane” went to get the form the contestant engaged the target in idle chitchat.\n“How’s the weather in Texas?” and “Have you ever been to Charlie’s Pub?” escalated\ninto things like, “Who handles the food for the cafeteria?” and “Want to see a cool\nwebsite we are working on here?”\nAll this happened while he was “waiting” for the ID number. Social engineers\nuse this tactic every day. Diversion and charm are key tools in many pretexts.\nInformation that is asked for during “chitchat” is perceived as having less value\nbecause of the time in the conversation it is asked for. If the SE had asked that same\nquestion when he was “verifying his audit fi ndings” it would have been met with a\ndiff erent attitude, but because he asked it during a friendly conversation so much\ninformation was given freely.\nMitigation for this SE tactic is to ponder the value of the information that you\nare planning on releasing despite of when in the conversation it is asked for. In the\nearlier example, the target’s simply waiting for that ID number before continuing any\nconversation would have been very appropriate and saved him from being duped.\nTh is particular point is not always easy to implement because employees, especially\nthose facing the customer, must be able to release some information without fear of\nattack. Simply being aware of the value of information cannot alone stop an attack.\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 347\nKeeping Software Updated\nIn most businesses you must be able to release information to the public and to\nclients. Even in my business I must be able to give out my phone numbers, emails,\nand web addresses. I must be able to send and receive PDF fi les and I have to be able\nto freely talk on the phone with clients, suppliers, and vendors.\nHowever, the points discussed so far indicate that releasing any of this informa-\ntion can be the end of one’s business and possibly privacy. What can you do to have\nthe freedom to release certain information and not fear the end?\nKeep updated. In our contest, more than 60% of the companies that were called\nwere still using Internet Explorer 6 and Adobe Acrobat 8. Th ose are staggering\nstatistics.\nDozens if not hundreds of public vulnerabilities exist in those two applications\nalone. Knowing that a target uses those two applications opens them up for an enor-\nmous number of attacks that can be so malicious that all the IDs, fi rewalls, and anti-\nvirus systems cannot possibly stop them. But do you know what can stop them?\nTh e answer is updates. Th e newest versions of software generally have patched\ntheir security holes, at least the majority of them. If a particular piece of software\nhas a horrible track record, don’t use it; switch to something less vulnerable.\nTh e problem that comes up is that companies are very slow when it comes to\nupgrades. IE 6 is very old, almost to the end of its life on Microsoft Support. Adobe\n8 has dozens of exploits publicly available. Th at is just two of the many pieces of\ninformation we found out in the contest. Th e reality of the matter, though, is that\nyou have to be able to release information. You must be able to freely tell people\nwhat is going on. To do that with less worry, you must make sure you and your\nemployee use updated software.\nIn the contest calls, if an employee divulged that the company used Firefox,\nChrome, or another secure browser, or FoxIt or the most up-to-date Adobe software,\ncontestants would have been shut down. I am not saying those pieces of software\ndo not experience any problems at all. Exploits for certain versions certainly exist,\nbut this software is signifi cantly less vulnerable. Th e possession of that informa-\ntion is still valuable but if no exploits are available then the next phase of the attack\ncannot be launched.\nKeeping software updated is the one tip that seems to get the most fl ack because\nit takes the most work and can cause the most overhead. Changing internal poli-\ncies and methodologies that allow very old software to still be in play can be very\ndiffi cult and cause all sorts of internal shifts.\n348 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nHowever, if a company is committed to security and committed to creating a\npersonal security awareness then committing to these changes will become part\nof the business culture.\nDeveloping Scripts\nOne more benefi cial thing bears mentioning: develop scripts. Don’t cringe; I don’t\nmean scripts in the sense that the employee must say X if a situation equals A plus\nB. I am talking about outlines that help an employee be prepared to use critical\nthinking when it counts the most. Consider these scenarios:\nWhat is the proper response when someone who claims to work for the CEO calls\nand demands your password? What do you do when a guy who has no appointment\nbut looks and acts the part of a vendor demands access to a part of the building or\nproperty?\nScripts can help an employee determine the proper response during these cir-\ncumstances and help them feel at ease. For example, a script may look like this:\nIf someone calls and claims to be from the management offi ce and demands com-\npliance of either handing over information or internal data, follow these steps:\n1. Ask for the person’s employee ID number and name. Do not answer any\nquestions until you have this information.\n2. After getting the identifying information, ask for the project ID num-\nber related to the project he or she is managing that requires this\ninformation.\n3. If the information in steps 1 and 2 is successfully obtained, comply. If\nit’s not, ask the person to have his or her manager send an email to your\nmanager requesting authorization and terminate the call.\nA simple script like this can help employees know what to say and do in circum-\nstances that can try their security consciousness.\nLearning from Social Engineering Audits\nIf you have ever broken a limb you know that as you recover your doctor may send\nyou for therapy. As therapists rehabilitate you, you may undergo some stress test-\ning. Th is type of testing enables your doctors to see whether you have weaknesses\nthat need to be strengthened. Th e same applies for your business, except instead of\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 349\nwaiting for the “break” to occur before you “test,” social engineering audits enable\nyou to stress-test your company before a breach occurs.\nTh e following sections answer a few key questions when it comes to social engi-\nneering audits and how to choose the best auditor. Before getting into the depth of\nsocial engineering audits, you should know what an audit really is.\nUnderstanding What a Social Engineering Audit Is\nIn the most basic terms a social engineering audit is where a security professional is\nhired to test the people, policies, and physical perimeter of a company by simulating\nthe same attacks that a malicious social engineer would use. Th e two main diff er-\nences between a malicious social engineer and a professional auditor are:\n» Usually, moral and legal guidelines exist that a professional auditor will\nfollow.\n» Th e goals of the professional auditor are always to help and not to\nembarrass, steal, or harm a client.\n» Professional audits generally have scope limitations that are not imposed\nupon real attackers.\nTh e professional auditor will spend a lot of time analyzing and gathering data on\na “target” or client and will use that information to develop realistic attack vectors.\nWhile doing this the professional auditor always keeps in mind the goals that are\nset forth in writing for each audit. Th is is an essential piece of the puzzle, because\ngoing down a path that can have very bad repercussions on both the SE and the\ntarget might be tempting. Clearly defi ned goals can keep a social engineering audi-\ntor from making that mistake.\nSetting Audit Goals\nTh e professional social engineer must engage in moral and ethical behavior while\nstill stretching across that line that allows him or her to put on the true “black hat”\nof a malicious social engineer. Th is means taking note of things that he or she can\nuse to gain access and expose a hole or weakness in a company’s defenses, no mat-\nter how low it may seem.\nFinding the security gaps has to be balanced with a concern for the individual\nemployees. Companies who are hacked with a social engineering audit often think\nthat fi ring the employee(s) who fell for the attack fi xes the problem and plugs the\n350 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\n“hole.” What the client fails to realize is that after an audit, those employees who did\nfall for the attacks are probably the most secure people in the building at that time.\nTh e professional social engineer must take extra precaution to ensure that the\nemployees are not put into the line of fi re. Personally I make it a key point to tell\nclients that the audit is not about the employees and, as far as I can help it, I do not\ninclude names of the employees who were used. In cases where that cannot be helped\nand I need to include those names, I focus the report on the fl aws the company has\nin its training, policies, and defenses that allowed the employee to falter.\nTh rowing an employee under the bus, so to speak, or ruining his or her charac-\nter or life should never be an option for a routine social engineering audit. When\noutlining the goals of an audit with an auditor I outline the level of intensity from\n0 to 10 for these key areas:\n» To determine whether employees will click on links in emails or open\nfi les from people they do not know well, leading to compromise\n» To determine whether an employee would go to a website and enter per-\nsonal or business-related information on that site\n» To determine how much information can be obtained via the phone or\nin-person visits of employees at work or personal places (that is, bars,\ngyms, daycares)\n» To determine the level of security in the offi ce perimeter by testing locks,\ncameras, motion sensors, and security guards\n» To determine the ability of a social engineer to create a malicious USB or\nDVD that will entice the employee to use it on his or her work computer,\ncompromising the business\nOf course, more areas will be tested, but what I try to do is outline closely the\ngoals the company has for this audit. What I fi nd is that companies often do not\nknow what they want. Th e auditor’s job is to walk them through diff erent avenues\ninto the company and to determine which of those they want tested.\nWhen these goals are clearly defi ned, you should also include a list of things that\nare never to be included in an audit.\nWhat Should and Should Not Be Included in an Audit\nMany diff erent ways exist for testing the outlined goals to see clearly whether a\nsecurity hole exists in a company. Using all the principles in this book can help\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 351\noutline a good plan for attack. However, avoid some things when planning an attack.\nTh ings like:\n» Attacking a target’s family or friends\n» Planting evidence of crimes or infi delity to discredit a target\n» Depending on the laws of the land, impersonating law enforcement can\nbe illegal\n» Breaking into a target’s home or apartment\n» Using evidence of a real aff air or embarrassing circumstance to blackmail\na target into compliance\nTh ings like these should be avoided at all costs because they do not accomplish\nthe goal and leave the target feeling violated. However, the question does come\nup about what to do if in an audit evidence appears of some of these things. Each\nauditor must personally decide how to handle these circumstances, but consider\na couple of examples.\nIn one audit, an auditor found out an employee was using the company’s high-\nspeed Internet to download gigabytes worth of porn to external hard drives. Instead\nof risking the employee’s getting fi red he went to the employee and told him he knew,\nbut he didn’t want him to get fi red and just gave him a warning to stop. Th e employee\nbecame embarrassed and upset and fi gured the auditor was going to still report him.\nHe decided he wanted to preemptively combat this attack and he went to the owners\nand said the auditor was planting evidence of this off ense on his computer.\nOf course, the auditor had logs and screenshots of when the compromise\noccurred and the employee was fi red anyway. But also the auditor was reprimanded\nfor not coming forward when he found an off ense of which the company had a\nstrict policy.\nIn another account, the auditor found evidence of a man downloading child\npornography to his computer and then distributing it to others on the Internet.\nTh e auditor knew from the other images on his computer that he had a wife and\nchildren and that reporting this would lead to divorce, probably jail time, and the\nruination of his career as well as the family’s life.\nTh e law of the land was that child pornography was illegal, as well as morally\ndisgusting and vile. Th e auditor turned the man in to the company as well as the\nauthorities, which cost that man his career, family, and freedom.\nHaving a clearly defi ned “do not” list enhances your audits and keeps you from\ncrossing your own moral and legal guidelines. In one interview I had with Joe\n352 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nNavarro, one of the world’s leaders on nonverbal communication, he made a state-\nment about this point. He said that unless you are a law enforcement agent you have\nto decide what lines you will and will not cross before you enter into an engagement.\nWith that in mind then what things should an auditor include in audits?\n» Phishing Attacks: Targeted email attacks that allow a company to see\nwhether its employees are susceptible to attacks through email.\n» Pretexting In-Person Attacks: Very precise and controlled pretexts are\nchosen and then performed over the phone or in-person to determine\nwhether employees will fall for them.\n» Baiting: An in-person attack where access is gained to the target’s build-\ning or other property by some method, and USBs or DVDs are dropped\nthat contain malicious fi les on them embedded with malicious code.\n» Tailgating (or piggybacking): An in-person attack where the auditor\nattempts to approach a group of employees to gain access to the building\nby just following them in.\n» Physical Security (Red Team): An attempt to gain physical access to an\noffi ce and take items of value to the company.\nTh is short list can help a professional auditor set some guidelines to defi ne what\nshould and should not be included. Still, one of the largest problems many compa-\nnies have is trying to pick out a good auditor, one who can accomplish these tasks\nat hand.\nChoosing the Best Auditor\nIf you broke a limb and the damage was bad, and a doctor told you that you have a\nchance for only 50% recovery, but that going to see a good surgeon could increase\nthose odds, wouldn’t you search high and low for a good surgeon to fi x your prob-\nlems? And when you found him, what questions would you ask? Wouldn’t you want\nto see his past work? You would want some proof of his ability to grasp the concepts\nand perform the tasks that would increase your chances of recovery.\nYou follow a similar process to fi nd the right auditor. Here are some of the basics\nthat you might want to fi nd out as you speak to an auditor:\n» Knowledge: Has the team released any research, papers, speeches,\nor other materials that display they are knowledgeable about social\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 353\nengineering? Are they known in the community for being leaders in this\nfi eld? You do not want to trust your audit and security to a team that is\nusing outdated methods and is not up on the most recent tactics being\nused.\nDetermining the amount of knowledge an auditor and team has is\nhard to do without a little research. Asking auditors about any papers,\narticles, or information they have written on the topics is not a bad idea.\nMake sure the team you hire is at the top of its game.\n» Experience: Clients often do not want to be identifi ed or named. In my\ncase, many clients do not want to be put on a website or marketing mate-\nrial because they feel this will embarrass them or make them vulnerable.\nBut you can determine the experience of the auditor in other ways. Ask\nhim about the methods he has used and how he implemented solutions\nin the past.\nAn auditor often does not want to let all the secrets out of the bag\nin an initial meeting, but ask him for one or two accounts of attacks he\nlaunched, which will help you determine his level of skill.\n» Contract: Having the audit completely outlined, documented, and limi-\ntations set can go a long way toward a successful audit. Personally, I do\nnot like to work with a ton of limitations because most malicious social\nengineers do not have any at all. But at least a small subset of rules writ-\nten out on what is and is not allowed should be agreed upon.\nA social engineer wants permission to record phone calls; video-\nrecord the building and interactions; and especially if an audit includes\nphysical security, to have written permission to remove items from the\npremises. An auditor doesn’t want to finish the audit just to be presented\nwith a warrant or a lawsuit.\nAlso designate an emergency contact person who knows about the\naudit and can vouch for the auditor and team. If an auditor finds himself\nin a legal jam he’ll want a number to call. No one wants to be perform-\ning a late-night dumpster dive to be met by the police and have to sit the\nnight in jail. Having a contact person provides a “get out of jail free” card\nand can save a lot of hassle in the long run.\n» Rapport: Apply the principles in this book to fi nd a good auditor. When\nyou speak with him on the phone or in person how does he make you\n354 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nfeel? What do you see? Do you get the sense he is very professional and\nhis goal is to really help you?\nDoes the team portray itself and its business as one you want to be\nassociated with? If you are the project manager who is hiring an auditor,\na load of responsibility rests with you. The auditor may not want to meet\nwith a team. The fewer people who know what the SE team looks like,\nthe better for physical security audits. The team, as a result, may only\nwant to meet with one or two people. This means you must ensure the\nauditor is high quality and can do the work needed.\n» Time: One of the biggest mistakes companies make when seeking audi-\ntors to help them is not giving them enough time to perform the job.\nTh ey fi gure that a few phone calls or one site visit can all be accom-\nplished in one day. Although that may be true, what about information\ngathering, planning, and scoping out the targets? Th ese things take time.\nTime is important but it is also a double-edged sword—allow enough\ntime for the auditor to do a good job, but not so much time that it\nbecomes a cost problem. Manage, but do not micro-manage.\nTh ese are just a few of the areas to consider when choosing the right auditor\nfor your company. In the end you must feel comfortable and good that the social\nengineering team will have your best interests at heart, will do their best to remain\nprofessional, and stay within the guidelines.\nConcluding Remarks\nKnowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.\n—Anton Chekhov\nTh e information that I provide in this book is not light-hearted. Much of the infor-\nmation shows serious vulnerabilities in the way people think and act. When I teach\nsecurity classes with my mentor, Mati, he talks about a payload encoder called\n“shikata ga nai,” which is Japanese for “it cannot be helped” or roughly translated,\n“there is no hope.”\nI thought about making that the epigraph, but I thought the phrase “there is no\nhope” is a little more fatalistic than I like to be normally. Instead, I feel the thought\nabout practice and knowledge fi ts more of the theme of the book. I have stated time\nand again that perfecting the skills as well as the ability to detect these skills in\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 355\nuse takes a lot more than just knowledge. Being too afraid about the things I have\nmentioned in this book leads to anger at all the ways people get hacked, which only\nleads down a path that will cause us to close our minds. Instead I suggest a diff erent\napproach to the information in this book besides fear: A new mindset that encour-\nages you to learn and think and understand the methods the “bad guys” use so you\ncan be protected from falling prey to them.\nNow I am not saying that there is no place for fear. Th ere defi nitely is room to\nfeel some healthy fear. Protecting your data, your personal information, and your\nidentity, but at the same time understanding the “hacker” mindset combined with\nthe information in this book, might be more benefi cial to you.\nTh is section touches on a few things I hope you can take away from this book\nand use in your life, especially if you are in charge of security for your company,\nyour clients, or reading this for your own personal security..\nSocial Engineering Isn’t Always Negative\nI hope that I impressed upon you that social engineering is not always negative.\nIt is not always the hackers or the con men who use social engineering tactics.\nDoctors, therapists, social workers, parents, children, bosses, employees—everyone\nuses social engineering tactics to some extent. Th e art of persuasion is used often\nin normal everyday social situations.\nLearning that social engineering isn’t always scary, dark, and evil can go a long\nway toward uncovering how certain skills are used. After you understand those\nskills, practice and become skilled or profi cient in them; discerning how they are\nbeing used against people then becomes much easier.\nYou can fi nd places to analyze these skills that are not in the dark corners of the\nworld. You can read books on psychology, persuasion, and sales, then observe in\nthe fi eld to see how these skills are used.\nThe Importance of Gathering and\nOrganizing Information\nI cannot really reiterate enough how important quality information gathering truly\nis. Th e quality, professionalism, and the very success of every social engineering\nengagement depends on the level of information gathering you do. Th e Web is a\nboundless and endless resource of information. Companies post their fi nancial\nrecords, employees’ names and titles, contact information, pictures of physical\n356 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nlocation, security policies, contracts, vendors and suppliers’ names, people’s per-\nsonal fi les, and so much more. On a personal level, employees as well as everyday\npeople post personal pictures, their addresses, their purchases, leases, contracts,\nfavorite foods, teams, music, and so on.\nArmed with all this overwhelming amount of information a social engineer can\npick and chose what he wants to use and what kind of attack vector to implement.\nAs the engagement continues the information gathered will give the social engi-\nneer the ability to use story lines and pretexts that will have the greatest eff ect on\nthe target. Without information gathering, as reiterated throughout the book, the\nengagement will most likely lead to failure.\nFor example, if a professional auditor is given three weeks for a job, he should\nspend half of that time gathering information. However, professional auditors often\nhave a tendency to get excited and approach the target with the old standby pretexts.\nDo not fall into this habit; spend a lot of time in information gathering.\nAlmost as important as the information gathering itself is how you store and\ncatalogue the information—perhaps by using one of the methods mentioned in\nChapter 2 to store and organize this information. Learning to not just effi ciently\ncollect the information but how to store the information can go a long way toward\nmaking it effi cient to use. Not simply dumping things into a massive document but\ncategorizing things, cataloging them, and labeling them will make the information\neasy to use, especially if you are on a phone engagement.\nJust remember that a social engineer is only as good as the information he obtains.\nI personally have seen too many gigs go down the drain because of bad informa-\ntion or lack of information. At the same time I have seen people who might not be\nthe smoothest speakers or the most charming succeed in very diffi cult situations\nbecause of the information they gathered.\nInformation is the crux of social engineering, and if you take anything away\nfrom this book, let it be that.\nChoose Your Words Carefully\nJust like this section’s opening epigraph, this topic lends itself to the thought that\ninformation has no value unless you put it into practice. You can have all the infor-\nmation gathered and organized and catalogued, but you need to use it effi ciently.\nTh e fi rst step in this is to organize what words you will use.\nI discussed the skills of elicitation and preloading. Th ese are two of the most\nvaluable skills, and I hope you practice using them. Use anchors, keywords, and\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 357\nphrases to load the target with emotions and thoughts to make him follow your\nlead. Preloading is a very powerful technique that cannot be mastered in a short\nwhile, but practice will enable you to use this skill. Th e great thing about preloading\nis that you can practice this skill at home, at work, with your kids, your parents,\nyour clients, really anywhere.\nDon’t think that practicing this means you will always have to get people to do\nthings against their will. Preloading is used to motivate people’s minds to be more\nopen to a suggestion or idea. You don’t have to use it maliciously. Kids do it all the\ntime. For example, your daughter says, “Daddy, I love you…” and adds a few seconds\nlater, “Can I have that new doll?” Th is is an example of preloading, putting a “target”\ninto an agreeable emotional state.\nOnce you master that skill, or at least become profi cient in using it, work on\nthe way you use elicitation. Remember that no one loves the feeling of being inter-\nrogated. Elicitation should not mimic a police interrogation; it should be a smooth,\nseamless conversation that is used to gather intelligence on the target or topic you\nare seeking.\nLearning the methods and process used to come up with questions that can be\nused in normal conversation will not only enhance your skills as a social engineer\nbut also as a communicator. People enjoy when they feel others are interested in\ntheir lives and their work. Using this skill for the good can enhance your ability as\na social engineer.\nI have a good friend that gets people to tell her anything. It is uncanny. Complete\nstrangers will, at the end of a conversation, say things like, “I just don’t know why\nI am telling you all these things...” She is not a social engineer or even in security,\nbut she is a great elicitor.\nMastering preloading and elicitation can enhance your ability to also plan out\nwhat you will say. Th ese skills can put your mind in the frame of seeking and gath-\nering information in a more intelligent and less intrusive way.\nHave a Good Pretext\nRemember that a good pretext is not a lie or a story. Instead you become and live\nyour pretext for a short time. Every fi ber of your being—your thoughts, actions,\nspeech, and motivation—should refl ect what the pretext would do. If you can accom-\nplish this then your pretext will be believable to the target.\nTh e other thing to remember is that pretexting is used in everyday life, not just\nin social engineering. Imagine this scenario: You just had an argument with your\n358 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nmate. Now it is time for work. You don’t want everyone to know that things at home\naren’t that good this day, so when you go to work and meet your coworkers who say,\n“Hey Jim how’s it going?” Your reply is, “Awesome. Couldn’t be better.”\nTh at is the opposite of the truth but what do you do to make that believable?\nShoot someone a smile, or project confi dence via your posture or body language.\nDepending on how private you are and how much you don’t want to share with your\nco-workers you might even have a “cover story” to prove how great life is.\nTh is is just one scenario, but people use pretexting all the time. Whenever you\nare trying to portray a diff erence from what is reality to people the “cover story” to\nmake it believable is a pretext. Of course, most people aren’t really good at it and\nare easily detected, but noticing these situations in your life and work will give you\na good basis of pretexting to analyze.\nAnalyzing these scenarios can help you identify areas you want to improve in\nyour pretexts and help you master this very useful skill.\nPractice Reading Expressions\nI think I can talk for weeks about microexpressions. Th e topic just fascinates me,\nand it intrigues me to think that people have built-in mechanisms for displaying\nour deepest darkest feelings, and most of us will have no control over it. How our\nemotions cause certain muscles to contract and display a certain expression for\nmilliseconds is just an amazing aspect of creation. But learning how to notice them,\nread them, and use those very same expressions to manipulate others is something\nthat truly astounds me.\nPractice how to recreate the microexpressions discussed in Chapter 5. As you\ndo, notice the emotions the microexpressions conjure up in you. Practicing these\nexpressions will also help you read them when others express them.\nAs you practice, do not focus just on what it takes to read microexpressions in\nothers but on how to control your own microexpressions and prevent someone\nusing their facial-reading reading skills on you. Remember that reading others is\na good skill, but having control over your own microexpressions, body language,\nand vocal tones is far better. Th is skill can enhance your security practice as well as\nyour personal relationships. After you master many of those skills, you will begin\nto see how you can utilize one of the main concepts Chapter 5, the human buff er\noverfl ow (HBO). Th e human mind works much like software, just on a higher level.\nBut it can be fuzzed, examined, and overthrown like software. Re-read that section\nto make sure you fully understand the principles presented.\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 359\nManipulation and Influence\nManipulation and infl uence are two aspects of social interaction that have some\ndramatic and powerful eff ects on the people you interact with. For that reason, use\nthe information in Chapter 6 with extreme care. Learning how to persuade and\nmanipulate people can literally make the diff erence between success or failure in\na social engineering endeavor. Every day, people try to manipulate and persuade\nothers to take actions. Some of these actions are very bad and can cost money,\npersonal freedom, and identities.\nUse those situations as teaching tools. Analyze the methods that marketers, psy-\nchologists, counselors, teachers, and even coworkers use to try to manipulate you.\nPick out points that you think you can learn from and put them into your arsenal.\nRemember that persuasion is not always negative: It doesn’t always have to mean\ngetting someone to do something they don’t want. Persuasion can have very positive\neff ects, and many times, positive persuasion is much more diffi cult. If you can master\nthose skills and use them to help people stay secure, you will be more readily able\nto identify when someone is using persuasion tactics in a negative sense.\nBe Alert to Malicious Tactics\nBeing aware of what tactics attackers use will surely keep you from falling victim\nto them. Th e professional auditors can use these tactics to educate their customers\non what to look for in a possible attack. Be alert to pick out instances of how these\nare being used.\nFor example, one tactic the “bad guys” use is to strike during times of trouble.\nWhen the planes hit the Twin Towers, the earthquakes hit Haiti, and the tsunami\nhit Asia, the devastation upon the human population and their lives, psyche, and\nemotions was insurmountable. During times of people’s vulnerability and weakness\nis exactly when the bad guys strike.\nLet me illustrate it this way: I once read an article that spoke about how lions\nhunt in the wild. It said that a lion, when it wants to confuse and disjoint a group of\nprey to choose a victim, will roar towards the ground—not toward the prey or sky,\nbut the ground. Why? It’s because the massive, fear-inspiring roar will reverb off\nthe ground and surround the prey. Th ey become confused by not knowing which\ndirection the lion is coming from. Some will scatter left, some will scatter right, but\nthey will leave their young, old, infi rm, and immature herd members open.\nTh e preceding is not too far off from how professional malicious social engineers\noperate. Th ey “roar” in such a way as to cause or add to the confusion. Th ey use\n360 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nwebsites that help fi nd dead loved ones after a natural disaster, or claim themselves\nto have lost family and friends in the carnage. When the emotions of the “targets”\nare so involved they can’t see straight is when an attack occurs.\nTh e inexperienced and immature (technologically speaking) fall victim fi rst by\ngiving out little bits of information until the attacker has enough to build a profi le.\nTh at profi le helps launch further attacks, and those attacks get more vicious and\nheartless.\nBe alert to these instances, and you will keep your clients and yourself protected\nfrom falling victim to them. Also, use these situations as a learning lesson, analyze\nthe methods used, and see whether they worked or failed. Doing so will enhance\nyour ability to be more alert to potential threats.\nTh e unfortunate diff erence in between a lion and a social engineer (besides the\nobvious) is that a social engineer gives no audible roar. He is not out there yelling,\n“I want prey, now run!” Instead malicious social engineers’ sly, subtle attacks trick\nthousands into their traps each year.\nUse Your Fear\nNow if this chapter has built any kind of fear in you all I can say is, “good.” You\nneed it. Because healthy fear can save your life, or at least in this case your identity\nand your business.\nUse that fear to motivate change. Don’t get angry and upset. Make a decision to\nchange and to educate yourself, your families, and your companies how to observe,\nnotice, and defend against these attacks. Make a decision to not allow your identities\nand your companies to be hacked, and then do something about it.\nTh is whole book boils down to “security through education.” Human hacking is an\nart form. Social engineering is a mixture and blending of sciences, art, and skill. When\nblended in the right amount and right mixture the results are “shikata ga nai.”\nCompanies lose millions of dollars per year to breaches, with a large majority\nof those breaches stemming from social engineering attacks. Yet, more often than\nnot, when we off er clients the chance to add social engineering auditing to their\npentesting services they decline.\nWhy?\nCompanies tend to fear change. Countless times in my professional practice I\nhave heard intelligent and successful business owners say things like, “We don’t\nneed a social engineering audit. Our people won’t fall for those tricks.” Th en during\nthe pentest we will do a few authorized phone calls to get information and when\nPREVENTION AND MITIGATION 361\nwe present the information in the report they are amazed how easy it was to get\nthe information.\nAt all levels of various companies, security awareness doesn’t tend to change\nmuch. When speaking to companies after a pentest about a security awareness train-\ning program we launched, many told us they do not perform formal intense training\nfor call center or tech support departments. Yet those are the same departments that\nmost often fall for social engineering attacks.\nTh is points to the core of the problem that I am speaking about here. Security\nthrough education cannot be a simple catch phrase; it has to become a mission state-\nment. Until companies and the people who make up those companies take security\npersonally and seriously, this problem won’t be fi xed completely. In the meantime,\nthose who were serious enough to read this book and to have a desire to peer into\nthe dark corners of society can enhance their skills enough to keep their families,\nselves, and companies a little more secure.\nWhen the “lion roars,” be the one who is at the front of the pack leading the\nexodus out of the way. Be an example of what to do and how to defend against\nthese attacks.\nWith enough time and enough eff ort anyone can be social engineered. Th ose\nwords are true, as scary as they are. Th at doesn’t mean there is no hope; it means\nyour job is to make malicious social engineering so diffi cult and time consuming\nthat most hackers will give up and go after “low-hanging fruit” or the prey that is\nleft behind. I know; it sounds cold. I would love it if everyone would read this book\nand make some massive changes—then companies would be truly secure. But that\nis just not the world we live in.\nTh at statement, then, raises a very serious question. If there truly is no hope, how\ncan companies, people, families, and everyone protect against this massive vulner-\nability? Until companies begin to realize their vulnerability to social engineering\nattacks, individuals will have to educate themselves about attack methods and stay\nvigilant, as well as spread the word to others. Only then do we have hope of staying\nif not one step ahead of an attack, then not too far behind.\nSummary\nAs I conclude this book, I hope it has opened your eyes to the world of social\nengineering. I hope that it will continue to help you take note of the potential for\nmalicious attacks. I hope it has helped you build or maintain a healthy fear of the\npotential for disaster.\n362 SOCIAL ENGINEERING: THE ART OF HUMAN HACKING\nI also hope this book helps you to protect your businesses, your families, your\nchildren, your investments, and your life. I hope that the information within has\nshowed you that staying completely secure and protected is not impossible.\nMati Aharoni, my mentor, says in one of his classes that the reason the bad guys\nusually win is because they have dedication, time, and motivation on their side.\nDon’t let life get in the way of security. Conversely, don’t let too much fear of the\nbad guys keep you from enjoying life.\nI hope that applying the principles in this book enhances your ability to read\nand communicate more eff ectively with people around you. Using them in many\naspects of your life, not just security, can prove to be a life-altering exercise. Social\nengineering is truly an art form. Enjoy.",
    "question": "What are the key steps to prevent and mitigate social engineering attacks, and how does creating a security awareness culture help in protecting individuals and companies from these threats?",
    "summary": "The text discusses the importance of creating a security awareness culture to prevent and mitigate social engineering attacks. It emphasizes that unlike traditional security measures, social engineering requires ongoing education and training to protect individuals and organizations from manipulation. The author outlines six key steps, including learning to identify attacks, developing personal security awareness, keeping software updated, and conducting social engineering audits. The book also highlights the need for a proactive approach to security, where people are taught to recognize and resist social engineering tactics, rather than waiting for an attack to occur. Ultimately, the text argues that security through education is the best defense against malicious social engineers."
