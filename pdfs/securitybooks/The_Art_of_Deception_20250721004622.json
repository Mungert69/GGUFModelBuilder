As young men, both Kevin Mitnick and\nI were intensely curious about the world and eager to prove\nourselves. We were rewarded often in our attempts to learn new things,\nsolve puzzles, and win at games. But at the same time, the world around\nus taught us rules of behavior that constrained our inner urge toward free\nexploration. For our boldest scientists and technological entrepreneurs, as\nwell as for people like Kevin Mitnick, following this inner urge offers the\ngreatest thrills, letting us accomplish things that others believe cannot be\ndone.\nKevin Mitnick is one of the finest people I know. Ask him, and he will\nsay forthrightly that what he used to do - social engineering - involes\nconning people. But Kevin is no longer a social engineer. And even when\nhe was, his motive never was to enrich himself or damage others. That’s\nnot to say that there aren’t dangerous and destructive criminals out there\nwho use social engineering to cause real harm. In fact, that’s exactly why\nKevin wrote this book - to warn you about them.\nThe Art of Deception shows how vulnerable we all are - government,\nbusiness, and each of us personally - to the intrusions of the social\nengineer. In this security-conscious era, we spend huge sums on\ntechnology\nto protect our computer networks and data. This book points out how easy\nit is to trick insiders and circumvent all this technological protection.\nWhether you work in business or government, this book provides a\npowerful road map to help you understand how social engineers work and\nwhat you can do to foil them. Using fictionalized stories that are both\nentertaining and eye-opening, Kevin and co-author Bill Simon bring to\nlife\nthe techniques of the social engineering underworld. After each story,\nthey offer practical guidelines to help you guard against the breaches and\nthreats they’re described.\nTechnological security leaves major gaps that people like Kevin can help\nus close. Read this book and you may finally realize that we all need to\nturn to the Mitnick’s among us for guidance.\n-Steve Wozniak\n\nPREFACE\nSome hackers destroy people’s files or entire hard drives; they’re called\ncrackers or vandals. Some novice hackers don’t bother learning the\ntechnology, but simply download hacker tools to break into computer\nsystems; they’re called script kiddies. More experienced hackers with\nprogramming skills develop hacker programs and post them to the Web\nand to bulletin board systems. And then there are individuals who have no\ninterest in the technology, but use the computer merely as a tool to aid\nthem in stealing money, goods, or services.\nDespite the media-created myth of Kevin Mitnick, I am not a malicious\nhacker.\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nSTARTING OUT\nMy path was probably set early in life. I was a happy-go-lucky kid, but\nbored. After my father split when I was three, my mother worked as a\nwaitress to support us. To see me then - an only child being raised by a\nmother who put in long, harried days on a sometimes-erratic schedule -\nwould have been to see a youngster on his own almost all his waking\nhours. I was my own babysitter.\nGrowing up in a San Fernando Valley community gave me the whole of\nLos Angeles to explore, and by the age of twelve I had discovered a way\nto travel free throughout the whole greater L.A. area. I realized one day\nwhile riding the bus that the security of the bus transfer I had purchased\nrelied on the unusual pattern of the paper-punch, that the drivers used to\nmark day; time, and route on the transfer slips. A friendly driver,\nanswering my carefully planted question, told me where to buy that\nspecial type of punch.\nThe transfers are meant to let you change buses and continue a journey to\nyour destination, but I worked out how to use them to travel anywhere I\nwanted to go for free. Obtaining blank transfers was a walk in the park.\nThe trash bins at the bus terminals were always filled with only-partly\nused books of transfers that the drivers tossed away at the end of the\nshifts. With a pad of blanks and the punch, I could mark my own transfers\nand travel anywhere that L.A. buses went. Before long, I had all but\nmemorized the bus schedules of the entire system. (This was an early\nexample of my surprising memory for certain types of information; I can\nstill, today, remember phone numbers, passwords, and other seemingly\ntrivial details as far back as my childhood.)\nAnother personal interest that surfaced at an early age was my fascination\nwith performing magic. Once I learned how a new trick worked, would\npractice, practice, and practice some more until I mastered it. To an\nextent, it was through magic that I discovered the enjoyment in gaining\nsecret knowledge.\nFrom Phone Phreak to Hacker\nMy first encounter with what I would eventually learn to call social\nengineering came about during my high school years when I met another\nstudent who was caught up in a hobby called phone phreakin. Phone\nphreaking is a type of hacking that allows you to explore the telephone\nnetwork by exploiting the phone systems and phone company employees.\nHe showed me neat tricks he could do with a telephone, like obtaining any\ninformation the phone company had on any customer, and using a secret\ntest number to make long-distance calls for free. (Actually it was free only\nto us. I found out much later that it wasn’t a secret test number at all. The\ncalls were, in fact, being billed to some poor company’s MCI account.)\nThat was my introduction to social engineering-my kindergarten, so to\nspeak. My friend and another phone phreaker I met shortly thereafter let\nme listen in as they each made pretext calls to the phone company. I heard\nthe things they said that made them sound believable; I learned about\ndifferent phone company offices, lingo, and procedures. But that\n\"training\" didn’t last long; it didn’t have to. Soon I was doing it all on my\nown, learning as I went, doing it even better than my first teachers.\nThe course my life would follow for the next fifteen years had been set. In\nhigh school, one of my all-time favorite pranks was gaining unauthorized\naccess to the telephone switch and changing the class of service of a\nfellow phone phreak. When he’d attempt to make a call from home, he’d\nget a message telling him to deposit a dime because the telephone\ncompany switch had received input that indicated he was calling from a\npay phone.\nI became absorbed in everything about telephones, not only the\nelectronics, switches, and computers, but also the corporate organization,\nthe procedures, and the terminology. After a while, I probably knew more\nabout the phone system than any single employee. And I had developed\nmy social engineering skills to the point that, at seventeen years old, I was\nable to talk most telco employees into almost anything, whether I was\nspeaking with them in person or by telephone.\nMy much-publicized hacking career actually started when I was in high\nschool. While I cannot describe the detail here, suffice it to say that one of\nthe driving forces in my early hacks was to be accepted by the guys in the\nhacker group.\nBack then we used the term hacker to mean a person who spent a great\ndeal of time tinkering with hardware and software, either to develop more\nefficient programs or to bypass unnecessary steps and get the job done\nmore quickly. The term has now become a pejorative, carrying the\nmeaning of \"malicious criminal.\" In these pages I use the term the way I\nhave always used it - in its earlier, more benign sense.\nAfter high school I studied computers at the Computer Learning Center in\nLos Angeles. Within a few months, the school’s computer manager\nrealized I had found vulnerability in the operating system and gained full\nadministrative privileges on their IBM minicomputer. The best computer\nexperts on their teaching staff couldn’t figure out how I had done this. In\nwhat may have been one of the earliest examples of \"hire the hacker,\" I\nwas given an offer I couldn’t refuse: Do an honors project to enhance the\nschool’s computer security, or face suspension for hacking the system. Of\ncourse, I chose to do the honors project, and ended up graduating cum\nlaude with honors.\nBecoming a Social Engineer\nSome people get out of bed each morning dreading their daily work\nroutine at the proverbial salt mines. I’ve been lucky enough to enjoy my\nwork. n particular, you can’t imagine the challenge, reward, and pleasure I\nhad the time I spent as a private investigator. I was honing my talents in\nthe performance art called social engineering (getting people to do things\nthey wouldn’t ordinarily do for a stranger) and being paid for it.\nFor me it wasn’t difficult becoming proficient in social engineering. My\nfather’s side of the family had been in the sales field for generations, so\nthe art of influence and persuasion might have been an inherited trait.\nWhen you combine that trait with an inclination for deceiving people, you\nhave the profile of a typical social engineer.\nYou might say there are two specialties within the job classification of\ncon artist. Somebody who swindles and cheats people out of their money\nbelongs to one sub-specialty, the grifter. Somebody who uses deception,\ninfluence, and persuasion against businesses, usually targeting their\ninformation, belongs to the other sub-specialty, the social engineer. From\nthe time of my bus-transfer trick, when I was too young to know there\nwas anything wrong with what I was doing, I had begun to recognize a\ntalent for finding out the secrets I wasn’t supposed to have. I built on that\ntalent by using deception, knowing the lingo, and developing a well-\nhoned skill of manipulation.\nOne way I worked on developing the skills of my craft, if I may call it a\ncraft, was to pick out some piece of information I didn’t really care about\nand see if I could talk somebody on the other end of the phone into\nproviding it, just to improve my skills. In the same way I used to practice\nmy magic tricks, I practiced pretexting. Through these rehearsals, I soon\nfound that I could acquire virtually any information I targeted.\nAs I described in Congressional testimony before Senators Lieberman and\nThompson years later:\nI have gained unauthorized access to computer systems at some of the\nlargest corporations on the planet, and have successfully penetrated some\nof the most resilient computer systems ever developed. I have used both\ntechnical and non-technical means to obtain the source code to various\noperating systems and telecommunications devices to study their\nvulnerabilities and their inner workings.\nAll of this activity was really to satisfy my own curiosity; to see what I\ncould do; and find out secret information about operating systems, cell\nphones, and anything else that stirred my curiosity.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nI’ve acknowledged since my arrest that the actions I took were illegal, and\nthat I committed invasions of privacy.\nMy misdeeds were motivated by curiosity. I wanted to know as much as I\ncould about how phone networks worked and the ins-and-outs of\ncomputer security. I went from being a kid who loved to perform magic\ntricks to becoming the world’s most notorious hacker, feared by\ncorporations and the government. As I reflect back on my life for the last\n30 years, I admit I made some extremely poor decisions, driven by my\ncuriosity, the desire to learn about technology, and the need for a good\nintellectual challenge.\nI’m a changed person now. I’m turning my talents and the extensive\nknowledge I’ve gathered about information security and social\nengineering tactics to helping government, businesses, and individuals\nprevent, detect, and respond to information-security threats.\nThis book is one more way that I can use my experience to help others\navoid the efforts of the malicious information thieves of the world. I think\nyou will find the stories enjoyable, eye-opening, and educational.\nIntroduction\nThis book contains a wealth of information about information security and\nsocial engineering. To help you find your way, here’s a quick look at how\nthis book is organized:\nIn Part 1 I’ll reveal security’s weakest link and show you why you and\nyour company are at risk from social engineering attacks.\nIn Part 2 you’ll see how social engineers toy with your trust, your desire to\nbe helpful, your sympathy, and your human gullibility to get what they\nwant. Fictional stories of typical attacks will demonstrate that social\nengineers can wear many hats and many faces. If you think you’ve never\nencountered one, you’re probably wrong. Will you recognize a scenario\nyou’ve experienced in these stories and wonder if you had a brush with\nsocial engineering? You very well might. But once you’ve read Chapters 2\nthrough 9, you’ll know how to get the upper hand when the next social\nengineer comes calling.\nPart 3 is the part of the book where you see how the social engineer ups\nthe ante, in made-up stories that show how he can step onto your\ncorporate premises, steal the kind of secret that can make or break your\ncompany, and thwart your hi-tech security measures. The scenarios in this\nsection will make you aware of threats that range from simple employee\nrevenge to cyber terrorism. If you value the information that keeps your\nbusiness running and the privacy of your data, you’ll want to read\nChapters 10 through 14 from beginning to end.\nIt’s important to note that unless otherwise stated, the anecdotes in this\nbook are purely fictional.\nIn Part 4 I talk the corporate talk about how to prevent successful social\nengineering attacks on your organization. Chapter 15 provides a blueprint\nfor a successful security-training program. And Chapter 16 might just\nsave your neck - it’s a complete security policy you can customize for\nyour organization and implement right away to keep your company and\ninformation safe.\nFinally, I’ve provided a Security at a Glance section, which includes\nchecklists, tables, and charts that summarize key information you can use\nto help your employees foil a social engineering attack on the job. These\ntools also provide valuable information you can use in devising your own\nsecurity-training program.\nThroughout the book you’ll also find several useful elements: Lingo boxes\nprovide definitions of social engineering and computer hacker\nterminology; Mitnick Messages offer brief words of wisdom to help\nstrengthen your security strategy; and notes and sidebars give interesting\nbackground or additional information.\nPart 1\nBehind The Scenes\n\nChapter 1\nSecurity’s Weakest Link\nA company may have purchased the best security technologies that money\ncan buy, trained their people so well that they lock up all their secrets\nbefore going home at night, and hired building guards from the best\nsecurity firm in the business.\nThat company is still totally Vulnerable.\nIndividuals may follow every best-security practice recommended by the\nexperts, slavishly install every recommended security product, and be\nthoroughly vigilant about proper system configuration and applying\nsecurity patches.\nThose individuals are still completely vulnerable.\n\nTHE HUMAN FACTOR\nTestifying before Congress not long ago, I explained that I could often get\npasswords and other pieces of sensitive information from companies by\npretending to be someone else and just asking for it.\nIt’s natural to yearn for a feeling of absolute safety, leading many people\nto settle for a false sense of security. Consider the responsible and loving\nhomeowner who has a Medico, a tumbler lock known as being pickproof,\ninstalled in his front door to protect his wife, his children, and his home.\nHe’s now comfortable that he has made his family much safer against\nintruders. But what about the intruder-who breaks a window, or cracks the\ncode to the garage door opener? How about installing a robust security\nsystem? Better, but still no guarantee. Expensive locks or no, the\nhomeowner remains vulnerable.\nWhy? Because the human factor is truly security’s weakest link.\nSecurity is too often merely an illusion, an illusion sometimes made even\nworse when gullibility, naivete, or ignorance come into play. The world’s\nmost respected scientist of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein, is\nquoted as saying, \"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human\nstupidity, and I’m not sure about the former.\" In the end, social\nengineering attacks can succeed when people are stupid or, more\ncommonly, simply ignorant about good security practices. With the same\nattitude as our security-conscious homeowner, many information\ntechnology (IT) professionals hold to the misconception that they’ve made\ntheir companies largely immune to attack because they’ve deployed\nstandard security products - firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or\nstronger authentication devices such as time-based tokens or biometric\nsmart cards. Anyone who thinks that security products alone offer true\nsecurity is settling for. the illusion of security. It’s a case of living in a\nworld of fantasy: They will inevitably, later if not sooner, suffer a security\nincident.\nAs noted security consultant Bruce Schneier puts it, \"Security is not a\nproduct, it’s a process.\" Moreover, security is not a technology problem -\nit’s a people and management problem.\nAs developers invent continually better security technologies, making it\nincreasingly difficult to exploit technical vulnerabilities, attackers will\nturn more and more to exploiting the human element. Cracking the human\nfirewall is often easy, requires no investment beyond the cost of a phone\ncall, and involves minimal risk.\n\nA CLASSIC CASE OF DECEPTION\nWhat’s the greatest threat to the security of your business assets? That’s\neasy: the social engineer--an unscrupulous magician who has you\nwatching his left hand while with his right he steals your secrets. This\ncharacter is often so friendly, glib, and obliging that you’re grateful for\nhaving encountered him.\nTake a look at an example of social engineering. Not many people today\nstill remember the young man named Stanley Mark Rifkin and his little\nadventure with the now defunct Security Pacific National Bank in Los\nAngeles. Accounts of his escapade vary, and Rifkin (like me) has never\ntold his own story, so the following is based on published reports.\nCode Breaking\nOne day in 1978, Rifkin moseyed over to Security Pacific’s authorized-\npersonnel-only wire-transfer room, where the staff sent and received\ntransfers totaling several billion dollars every day.\nHe was working for a company under contract to develop a backup\nsystem for the wire room’s data in case their main computer ever went\ndown. That role gave him access to the transfer procedures, including how\nbank officials arranged for a transfer to be sent. He had learned that bank\nofficers who were authorized to order wire transfers would be given a\nclosely guarded daily code each morning to use when calling the wire\nroom.\nIn the wire room the clerks saved themselves the trouble of trying to\nmemorize each day’s code: They wrote down the code on a slip of paper\nand posted it where they could see it easily. This particular November day\nRifkin had a specific reason for his visit. He wanted to get a glance at that\npaper.\nArriving in the wire room, he took some notes on operating procedures,\nsupposedly to make sure the backup system would mesh properly with the\nregular systems. Meanwhile, he surreptitiously read the security code\nfrom the posted slip of paper, and memorized it. A few minutes later he\nwalked out. As he said afterward, he felt as if he had just won the lottery.\nThere’s This Swiss Bank Account...\nLeaving the room at about 3 o’clock in the afternoon, he headed straight\nfor the pay phone in the building’s marble lobby, where he deposited a\ncoin and dialed into the wire-transfer room. He then changed hats,\ntransforming himself from Stanley Rifkin, bank consultant, into Mike\nHansen, a member of the bank’s International Department.\nAccording to one source, the conversation went something like this:\n\"Hi, this is Mike Hansen in International,\" he said to the young woman\nwho answered the phone.\nShe asked for the office number. That was standard procedure, and he was\nprepared: (cid:147)286(cid:148) he said.\nThe girl then asked, \"Okay, what’s the code?\"\nRifkin has said that his adrenaline-powered heartbeat \"picked up its pace\"\nat this point. He responded smoothly, \"4789.\" Then he went on to give\ninstructions for wiring \"Ten million, two-hundred thousand dollars\nexactly\" to the Irving Trust Company in New York, for credit of the\nWozchod Handels Bank of Zurich, Switzerland, where he had already\nestablished an account.\nThe girl then said, \"Okay, I got that. And now I need the interoffice\nsettlement number.\"\nRifkin broke out in a sweat; this was a question he hadn’t anticipated,\nsomething that had slipped through the cracks in his research. But he\nmanaged to stay in character, acted as if everything was fine, and on the\nspot answered without missing a beat, \"Let me check; I’ll call you right\nback.\" He changed hats once again to call another department at the bank,\nthis time claiming to be an employee in the wire-transfer room. He\nobtained the settlement number and called the girl back.\nShe took the number and said, \"Thanks.\" (Under the circumstances, her\nthanking him has to be considered highly ironic.)\nAchieving Closure\nA few days later Rifkin flew to Switzerland, picked up his cash, and\nhanded over $8 million to a Russian agency for a pile of diamonds. He\nflew back, passing through U.S. Customs with the stones hidden in a\nmoney belt. He had pulled off the biggest bank heist in history--and done\nit without using a gun, even without a computer. Oddly, his caper\neventually made it into the pages of the Guinness Book of World Records\nin the category of \"biggest computer fraud.\"\nStanley Rifkin had used the art of deception--the skills and techniques that\nare today called social engineering. Thorough planning and a good gift of\ngab is all it really took.\nAnd that’s what this book is about--the techniques of social engineering\n(at which yours truly is proficient) and how to defend against their being\nused at your company.\n\nTHE NATURE OF THE THREAT\nThe Rifkin story makes perfectly clear how misleading our sense of\nsecurity can be. Incidents like this - okay, maybe not $10 million heists,\nbut harmful incidents nonetheless - are happening every day. You may be\nlosing money right now, or somebody may be stealing new product plans,\nand you don’t even know it. If it hasn’t already happened to your\ncompany, it’s not a question of if it will happen, but when.\nA Growing Concern\nThe Computer Security Institute, in its 2001 survey of computer crime,\nreported that 85 percent of responding organizations had detected\ncomputer security breaches in the preceding twelve months. That’s an\nastounding number: Only fifteen out of every hundred organizations\nresponding were able to say that they had not had a security breach during\nthe year. Equally astounding was the number of organizations that\nreported that they had experienced financial losses due to computer\nbreaches: 64 percent. Well over half the organizations had suffered\nfinancially. In a single year.\nMy own experiences lead me to believe that the numbers in reports like\nthis are somewhat inflated. I’m suspicious of the agenda of the people\nconducting the survey. But that’s not to say that the damage isn’t\nextensive; it is. Those who fail to plan for a security incident are planning\nfor failure.\nCommercial security products deployed in most companies are mainly\naimed at providing protection against the amateur computer intruder, like\nthe youngsters known as script kiddies. In fact, these wannabe hackers\nwith downloaded software are mostly just a nuisance. The greater losses,\nthe real threats, come from sophisticated attackers with well-defined\ntargets who are motivated by financial gain. These people focus on one\ntarget at a time rather than, like the amateurs, trying to infiltrate as many\nsystems as possible. While amateur computer intruders simply go for\nquantity, the professionals target information of quality and value.\nTechnologies like authentication devices (for proving identity), access\ncontrol (for managing access to files and system resources), and intrusion\ndetection systems (the electronic equivalent of burglar alarms) are\nnecessary to a corporate security program. Yet it’s typical today for a\ncompany to spend more money on coffee than on deploying\ncountermeasures to protect the organization against security attacks.\nJust as the criminal mind cannot resist temptation, the hacker mind is\ndriven to find ways around powerful security technology safeguards. And\nin many cases, they do that by targeting the people who use the\ntechnology.\nDeceptive Practices\nThere’s a popular saying that a secure computer is one that’s turned off.\nClever, but false: The pretexter simply talks someone into going into the\noffice and turning that computer on. An adversary who wants your\ninformation can obtain it, usually in any one of several different ways. It’s\njust a matter of time, patience, personality, and persistence. That’s where\nthe art of deception comes in.\nTo defeat security measures, an attacker, intruder, or social engineer must\nfind a way to deceive a trusted user into revealing information, or trick an\nunsuspecting mark into providing him with access. When trusted\nemployees are deceived, influenced, or manipulated into revealing\nsensitive information, or performing actions that create a security hole for\nthe attacker to slip through, no technology in the world can protect a\nbusiness. Just as cryptanalysts are sometimes able to reveal the plain text\nof a coded message by finding a weakness that lets them bypass the\nencryption\ntechnology, social engineers use deception practiced on your employees\nto bypass security technology.\n\nABUSE OF TRUST\nIn most cases, successful social engineers have strong people skills.\nThey’re charming, polite, and easy to like--social traits needed for\nestablishing rapid rapport and trust. An experienced social engineer is\nable to gain access to virtually any targeted information by using the\nstrategies and tactics of his craft.\nSavvy technologists have painstakingly developed information-security\nsolutions to minimize the risks connected with the use of computers, yet\nleft unaddressed the most significant vulnerability, the human factor.\nDespite our intellect, we humans - you, me, and everyone else - remain\nthe most severe threat to each other’s security.\nOur National Character\nWe’re not mindful of the threat, especially in the Western world. In the\nUnited States most of all, we’re not trained to be suspicious of each other.\nWe are taught to \"love thy neighbor\" and have trust and faith in each\nother. Consider how difficult it is for neighborhood watch organizations\nto get people to lock their homes and cars. This sort of vulnerability is\nobvious, and yet it seems to be ignored by many who prefer to live in a\ndream world - until they get burned.\nWe know that all people are not kind and honest, but too often we live as\nif they were. This lovely innocence has been the fabric of the lives of\nAmericans and it’s painful to give it up. As a nation we have built into our\nconcept of freedom that the best places to live are those where locks and\nkeys are the least necessary.\nMost people go on the assumption that they will not be deceived by\nothers, based upon a belief that the probability of being deceived is very\nlow; the attacker, understanding this common belief, makes his request\nsound so reasonable that it raises no suspicion, all the while exploiting the\nvictim’s trust.\nOrganizational Innocence\nThat innocence that is part of our national character was evident back\nwhen computers were first being connected remotely. Recall that the\nARPANet (the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects\nAgency\nNetwork), the predecessor of the Internet, was designed as a way of\nsharing research information between government, research, and\neducational institutions. The goal was information freedom, as well as\ntechnological advancement. Many educational institutions therefore set up\nearly computer systems with little or no security. One noted software\nlibertarian, Richard Stallman, even refused to protect his account with a\npassword.\nBut with the Internet being used for electronic commerce, the dangers of\nweak security in our wired world have changed dramatically. Deploying\nmore technology is not going to solve the human security problem.\nJust look at our airports today. Security has become paramount, yet we’re\nalarmed by media reports of travelers who have been able to circumvent\nsecurity and carry potential weapons past checkpoints. How is this\npossible during a time when our airports are on such a state of alert? Are\nthe metal detectors failing? No. The problem isn’t the machines. The\nproblem is the human factor: The people manning the machines. Airport\nofficials can marshal the National Guard and install metal detectors and\nfacial recognition systems, but educating the frontline security staff on\nhow to properly screen passengers is much more likely to help.\nThe same problem exists within government, business, and educational\ninstitutions throughout the world. Despite the efforts of security\nprofessionals, information everywhere remains vulnerable and will\ncontinue to be seen as a ripe target by attackers with social engineering\nskills, until the weakest link in the security chain, the human link, has\nbeen strengthened.\nNow more than ever we must learn to stop wishful thinking and become\nmore aware of the techniques that are being used by those who attempt to\nattack the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer\nsystems and networks. We’ve come to accept the need for defensive\ndriving; it’s time to accept and learn the practice of defensive computing.\nThe threat of a break-in that violates your privacy, your mind, or your\ncompany’s information systems may not seem real until it happens. To\navoid such a costly dose of reality, we all need to become aware,\neducated, vigilant, and aggressively protective of our information assets,\nour own personal information, and our nation’s critical infrastructures.\nAnd we must implement those precautions today.\n\nTERRORISTS AND DECEPTION\nOf course, deception isn’t an exclusive tool of the social engineer.\nPhysical terrorism makes the biggest news, and we have come to realize\nas never\nbefore that the world is a dangerous place. Civilization is, after all, just a\nthin veneer.\nThe attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., in September 2001\ninfused sadness and fear into the hearts of every one of us - not just\nAmericans, but well-meaning people of all nations. We’re now alerted to\nthe fact that there are obsessive terrorists located around the globe, well -\ntrained and waiting to launch further attacks against us.\nThe recently intensified effort by our government has increased the levels\nof our security consciousness. We need to stay alert, on guard against all\nforms of terrorism. We need to understand how terrorists treacherously\ncreate false identities, assume roles as students and neighbors, and melt\ninto the crowd. They mask their true beliefs while they plot against us -\npracticing tricks of deception similar to those you will read about in these\npages.\nAnd while, to the best of my knowledge, terrorists have not yet used\nsocial engineering ruses to infiltrate corporations, water-treatment plants,\nelectrical generation facilities, or other vital components of our national\ninfrastructure, the potential is there. It’s just too easy. The security\nawareness and security policies that I hope will be put into place and\nenforced by corporate senior management because of this book will come\nnone too soon.\n\nABOUT THIS BOOK\nCorporate security is a question of balance. Too little security leaves your\ncompany vulnerable, but an overemphasis on security gets in the way of\nattending to business, inhibiting the company’s growth and prosperity.\nThe challenge is to achieve a balance between security and productivity.\nOther books on corporate security focus on hardware and software\ntechnology, and do not adequately cover the most serious threat of all:\nhuman deception. The purpose of this book, in contrast, is to help you\nunderstand how you, your co-workers, and others in your company are\nbeing manipulated, and the barriers you can erect to stop being victims.\nThe book focuses mainly on the non-technical methods that hostile\nintruders use to steal information, compromise the integrity of information\nthat is believed to be safe but isn’t., or destroy company work product.\nMy task is made more difficult by a simple truth: Every reader will have\nbeen manipulated by the grand experts of all time in social engineering -\ntheir parents. They found ways to get you - \"for your own good\" - to do\nwhat they thought best. Parents become great storytellers in the same way\nthat social engineers skillfully develop very plausible stories, reasons, and\njustifications for achieving their goals. Yes, we were all molded by our\nparents: benevolent (and sometimes not so benevolent) social engineers.\nConditioned by that training, we have become vulnerable to manipulation.\nWe would live a difficult life if we had to be always on our guard,\nmistrustful of others, concerned that we might become the dupe of\nsomeone trying to take advantage of us. In a perfect world we would\nimplicitly trust others, confident that the people we encounter are going to\nbe honest and trustworthy. But we do not live in a perfect world, and so\nwe have to exercise a standard of vigilance to repel the deceptive efforts\nof our adversaries.\nThe main portions of this book, Parts 2 and 3, are made up of stories that\nshow you social engineers in action. In these sections you’ll read about:\n(cid:149) What phone phreaks discovered years ago: A slick method for getting\nan unlisted phone number from the telephone company.\n(cid:149) Several different methods used by attackers to convince even alert,\nsuspicious employees to reveal their computer usernames and\npasswords.\n(cid:149) How an Operations Center manager cooperated in allowing an attacker\nto steal his company’s most secret product information.\n(cid:149) The methods of an attacker who deceived a lady into downloading\nsoftware that spies on every keystroke she makes and emails the\ndetails to him.\n(cid:149) How private investigators get information about your company, and\nabout you personally, that I can practically guarantee will send a chill\nup your spine.\nYou might think as you read some of the stories in Parts 2 and 3 that\nthey’re not possible, that no one could really succeed in getting away with\nthe lies, dirty tricks, and schemes de, scribed in these pages. The reality is\nthat in every case, these stories depict events that can and do happen;\nmany of them are happening every day somewhere on the planet, maybe\neven to your business as you read this book.\nThe material in this book will be a real eye-opener when it comes to\nprotecting your business, but also personally deflecting the advances of a\nsocial engineer to protect the integrity of information in your private life.\nIn Part 4 of this book I switch gears. My goal here is to help you create\nthe necessary business policies and awareness training to minimize the\nchances of your employees ever being duped by a social engineer.\nUnderstanding the strategies, methods, and tactics of the social engineer\nwill help prepare you to deploy reasonable controls to safeguard your IT\nassets, without undermining your company’s productivity.\nIn short, I’ve written this book to raise your awareness about the serious\nthreat posed by social engineering, and to help you make sure that your\ncompany and its employees are less likely to be exploited in this way.\nOr perhaps I should say, far less likely to be exploited ever again.\nPart 2\nThe Art Of The Attacker",
    "question": "What is social engineering and how can it be used to deceive people to gain access to sensitive information?",
    "summary": "The book \"The Art of Deception\" by Kevin Mitnick and William Simon explains how social engineering, a form of deception, is a major security threat because it exploits human vulnerability rather than technology. It highlights real-life examples of how attackers manipulate people to gain access to sensitive information. The authors emphasize the importance of awareness, training, and policies to defend against such attacks and protect both businesses and individuals from security breaches."

    "text": "Chapter 2\nWhen Innocuous Information Isn’t\nWhat do most people think is the real threat from social engineers? What\nshould you do to be on your guard?\nIf the goal is to capture some highly valuable prize--say, a vital\ncomponent of the company’s intellectual capital - then perhaps what’s\nneeded is, figuratively, just a stronger vault and more heavily armed\nguards. Right?\nBut in reality penetrating a company’s security often starts with the bad\nguy obtaining some piece of information or some document that seems so\ninnocent, so everyday and unimportant, that most people in the\norganization wouldn’t see any reason why the item should be protected\nand restricted\n\nHIDDEN VALUE OF INFORMATION\nMuch of the seemingly innocuous information in a company’s possession\nis prized\nby a social engineering attacker because it can play a vital role in his\neffort to dress himself in a cloak of believability.\nThroughout these pages, I’m going to show you how social engineers do\nwhat they do by letting you \"witness\" the attacks for yourself--sometimes\npresenting the action from the viewpoint of the people being victimized,\nallowing you to put yourself in their shoes and gauge how you yourself\n(or maybe one of your employees or co-workers) might have responded.\nIn many cases you’ll also experience the same events from the perspective\nof the social engineer.\nThe first story looks at a vulnerability in the financial industry.\n\nCREDITCHEX\nFor a long time, the British put up with a very stuffy banking system. As\nan ordinary, upstanding citizen, you couldn’t walk in off the street and\nopen a bank account. No, the bank wouldn’t consider accepting you as a\ncustomer unless some person already well established as a customer\nprovided you with a letter of recommendation.\nQuite a difference, of course, in the seemingly egalitarian banking\nworld of today. And our modern ease of doing business is nowhere more\nin evidence than in friendly, democratic America, where almost anyone\ncan walk into a bank and easily open a checking account, right? Well, not\nexactly. The truth is that banks understandably have a natural reluctance\nto open. an account for somebody who just might have a history of\nwriting bad checks--that would be about as welcome as a rap sheet of\nbank robbery or embezzlement charges. So it’s standard practice at many\nbanks to get a quick thumbs-up or thumbs-down on a prospective new\ncustomer.\nOne of the major companies that banks contract with for this information\nis an outfit we’ll call CreditChex. They provide a valuable service to their\nclients, but like many companies, can also unknowingly provide a handy\nservice to knowing social engineers.\nThe First Call: Kim Andrews\n\"National Bank, this is Kim. Did you want to open an account today?\"\n\"Hi, Kim. I have a question for you. Do you guys use CreditChex?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"When you phone in to CreditChex, what do you call the number you give\nthem--is it a ’Merchant ID’?\"\nA pause; she was weighing the question, wondering what this was about\nand whether she should answer.\nThe caller quickly continued without missing a beat:\n\"Because, Kim, I’m working on a book. It deals with private\ninvestigations.\"\n\"Yes,\" she said, answering the question with new confidence, pleased to\nbe helping a writer.\n\"So it’s called a Merchant ID, right?\"\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\"Okay, great. Because I wanted to male sure I had the lingo right. For the\nbook. Thanks for your help. Good-bye, Kim.\"\nThe Second Call: Chris Talbert\n\"National Bank, New Accounts, this is Chris.\"\n\"Hi, Chris. This is Alex,\" the caller said. \"I’m a customer service rep\nwith CreditChex. We’re doing a survey to improve our services. Can you\nspare me a couple of minutes?\"\nShe was glad to, and the caller went on:\n\"Okay - what are the hours your branch is open for business?\" She\nanswered, and continued answering his string of questions.\n\"How many employees at your branch use our service?\"\n\"How often do you call us with an inquiry?\"\n\"Which of our 800-numbers have we assigned you for calling us?\"\n\"Have our representatives always been courteous?\"\n\"How’s our response time?\"\n\"How long have you been with the bank?\"\n\"What Merchant ID are you currently using?\"\n\"Have you ever found any inaccuracies with the information we’ve\nprovided you?\"\n\"If you had any suggestions for improving our service, what would they\nbe?\"\nAnd:\n\"Would you be willing to fill out periodic questionnaires if we send them\nto your branch?\"\nShe agreed, they chatted a bit, the caller rang off, and Chris went back to\nwork.\nThe Third Call: Henry McKinsey\n\"CreditChex, this is Henry McKinsey, how can I help you?\"\nThe caller said he was from National Bank. He gave the proper Merchant\nID and then gave the name and social security number of the person he\nwas looking for information on. Henry asked for the birth date, and the\ncaller gave that, too.\nAfter a few moments, Henry read the listing from his computer screen.\n\"Wells Fargo reported NSF in 1998, one time, amount of $2,066.\" NSF (cid:150)\nnon sufficient funds - is the familiar banking lingo for checks that have\nbeen written when there isn’t enough money in the account to cover them.\n\"Any activities since then?\"\n\"No activities.\"\n\"Have there been any other inquiries?\"\n\"Let’s see. Okay, two of them, both last month. Third United Credit Union\nof Chicago.\" He stumbled over the next name, Schenectady Mutual\nInvestments, and had to spell it. \"That’s in New York State,\" he added.\nPrivate Investigator at Work\nAll three of those calls were made by the same person: a private\ninvestigator we’ll call Oscar Grace. Grace had a new client, one of his\nfirst. A cop until a few months before, he found that some of this new\nwork came naturally, but some offered a challenge to his resources and\ninventiveness. This one came down firmly in the challenge category.\nThe hardboiled private eyes of fiction - the Sam Spades and the Philip\nMarlowes - spend long night time hours sitting in cars waiting to catch a\ncheating spouse. Real-life PIs do the same. They also do a less written\nabout, but no less important kind of snooping for warring spouses, a\nmethod that leans more heavily on social engineering skills than on\nfighting off the boredom of night time vigils.\nGrace’s new client was a lady who looked as if she had a pretty\ncomfortable budget for clothes and jewelry. She walked into his office\none day and took a seat in the leather chair, the only one that didn’t have\npapers piled on it. She settled her large Gucci handbag on his desk with\nthe logo turned to face him and announced she was planning to tell her\nhusband that she wanted a divorce, but admitted to \"just a very little\nproblem.\"\nIt seemed her hubby was one step ahead. He had already pulled the cash\nout of their savings account and an even larger sum from their brokerage\naccount. She wanted to know where their assets had been squirreled away,\nand her divorce lawyer wasn’t any help at all. Grace surmised the lawyer\nwas one of those uptown, high-rise counselors who wouldn’t get his hands\ndirty on something messy like where did the money go.\nCould Grace help?\nHe assured her it would be a breeze, quoted a fee, expenses billed at cost,\nand collected a check for the first payment.\nThen he faced his problem. What do you do if you’ve never handled a\npiece of work like this before and don’t quite know how to go about\ntracking down a money trail? You move forward by baby steps. Here,\naccord- mg to our source, is Grace’s story.\nI knew about CreditChex and how banks used the outfit - my ex-wife used\nto work at a bank. But I didn’t know the lingo and procedures, and trying\nto ask my ex- would be a waste of time.\nStep one: Get the terminology straight and figure out how to make the\nrequest so it sounds like I know what I’m talking about. At the bank I\ncalled, the first young lady, Kim, was suspicious when I asked about how\nthey identify themselves when they phone CreditChex. She hesitated; she\ndidn’t know whether to tell me. Was I put off by that? Not a bit. In fact,\nthe hesitation gave me an important clue, a sign that I had to supply a\nreason she’d find believable. When I worked the con on her about doing\nresearch for a book, it relieved her suspicions. You say you’re an author or\na movie writer, and everybody opens up.\nShe had other knowledge that would have helped - things like what\nreformation CreditChex requires to identify the person you’re calling\nabout, what information you can ask for, and the big one, what was Kim’s\nbank Merchant ID number. I was ready to ask those questions, but her\nhesitation sent up the red flag. She bought the book research story, but she\nalready had a few niggling suspicions. If she’d been more willing right\nway, I would have asked her to reveal more details about their procedures.\n\nLINGO\nMARK: The victim of a con.\nBURN THE SOURCE: An attacker is said to have burned the source\nwhen he allows a victim to recognize that an attack has taken place. Once\nthe victim becomes aware and notifies other employees or management of\nthe attempt, it becomes extremely difficult to exploit the same source in\nfuture attacks.\nYou have to go on gut instinct, listen closely to what the mark is saying\nand how she’s saying it. This lady sounded smart enough for alarm bells\nto start going off if I asked too many unusual questions. And even though\nshe didn’t know who I was or what number I was calling from, still in this\nbusiness you never want anybody putting out the word to be on the look\nout for someone calling to get information about the business. That(cid:146)s\nbecause you don’t want to burn the source - you may want to call same\noffice back another time.\nI’m always on the watch for little signs that give me a read on how\ncooperative a person is, on a scale that runs from \"You sound like a nice\nperson and I believe everything you’re saying\" to \"Call the cops, alert the\nNational Guard, this guy’s up to no good.\"\nI read Kim as a little bit on edge, so I just called somebody at a different\nbranch. On my second call with Chris, the survey trick played like a\ncharm. The tactic here is to slip the important questions in among\ninconsequential ones that are used to create a sense of believability.\nBefore I dropped the question about the Merchant ID number with\nCreditChex, I ran a little last-minute test by asking her a personal question\nabout how long she’d been with the bank.\nA personal question is like a land mine - some people step right over it\nand never notice; for other people, it blows up and sends them scurrying\nfor safety. So if I ask a personal question and she answers the question\nand the tone of her voice doesn’t change, that means she probably isn’t\nskeptical about the nature of the request. I can safely ask the sought after\nquestion without arousing her suspicions, and she’ll probably give me the\nanswer I’m looking for.\nOne more thing a good PI knows: Never end the conversation after getting\nthe key information. Another two or three questions, a little chat, and then\nit’s okay to say good-bye. Later, if the victim remembers anything about\nwhat you asked, it will probably be the last couple of questions. The rest\nwill usually be forgotten.\nSo Chris gave me their Merchant ID number, and the phone number they\ncall to make requests. I would have been happier if I had gotten to ask\nsome questions about how much information you can get from\nCreditChex. But it was better not to push my luck.\nIt was like having a blank check on CreditChex. I could now call and get\ninformation whenever I wanted. I didn’t even have to pay for the service.\nAs it turned out, the CreditChex rep was happy to share exactly the\ninformation I wanted: two places my client’s husband had recently applied\nto open an account. So where were the assets his soon-to-be ex-wife was\nlooking for? Where else but at the banking institutions the guy at\nCreditChex listed?\nAnalyzing the Con\nThis entire ruse was based on one of the fundamental tactics of social\nengineering: gaining access to information that a company employee\ntreats as innocuous, when it isn’t.\nThe first bank clerk confirmed the terminology to describe the identifying\nnumber used when calling CreditChex: the Merchant ID. The second\nprovided the phone number for calling CreditChex, and the most vital\npiece of information, the bank’s Merchant ID number. All this information\nappeared to the clerk to be innocuous. After all, the bank clerk thought\nshe was talking to someone from CreditChex -so what could be the harm\nin disclosing the number?\nAll of this laid the groundwork for the third call. Grace had everything he\nneeded to phone CreditChex, pass himself off as a rep from one of their\ncustomer banks, National, and simply ask for the information he was\nafter.\nWith as much skill at stealing information as a good swindler has at\nstealing your money, Grace had well-honed talents for reading people. He\nknew the common tactic of burying the key questions among innocent\nones. He knew a personal question would test the second clerk’s\nwillingness to cooperate, before innocently asking for the Merchant ID\nnumber.\nThe first clerk’s error in confirming the terminology for the CreditChex ID\nnumber would be almost impossible to protect against. The information is\nso widely known within the banking industry that it appears to be\nunimportant - the very model of the innocuous. But the second clerk,\nChris, should not have been so willing to answer questions without\npositively verifying that the caller was really who he claimed to be. She\nshould, at the very least, have taken his name and number and called\nback; that way, if any questions arose later, she may have kept a record of\nwhat phone number the person had used. In this case, making a call like\nthat would have made it much more difficult for the attacker to\nmasquerade as a representative from CreditChex.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nA Merchant ID in this situation is analogous to a password. If bank\npersonnel treated it like an ATM PIN, they might appreciate the sensitive\nnature of the information. Is there an internal code or number in your\norganization that people aren’t treating with enough care?\nBetter still would have been a call to CreditChex using a nun bank already\nhad on record - not a number provided by the caller (cid:150) to verify that the\nperson really worked there, and that the company was really doing a\ncustomer survey. Given the practicalities of the real world and the time\npressures that most people work under today, though, this kind of\nverification phone call is a lot to expect, except when an employee is\nsuspicious that some kind of attack is being made.\n\nTHE ENGINEER TRAP\nIt is widely known that head-hunter firms use social engineering to recruit\ncorporate talent. Here’s an example of how it can happen.\nIn the late 1990s, a not very ethical employment agency signed a new\nclient, a company looking for electrical engineers with experience in the\ntelephone industry. The honcho on the project was a lady endowed with a\nthroaty voice and sexy manner that she had learned to use to develop\ninitial trust and rapport over the phone.\nThe lady decided to stage a raid on a cellular phone service provider to\nsee if she could locate some engineers who might be tempted to walk\nacross the street to a competitor. She couldn’t exactly call the switch board\nand say, \"Let me talk to anybody with five years of engineering\nexperience.\" Instead, for reasons that will become clear in a moment, she\nbegan the talent assault by seeking a piece of information that appeared to\nhave no sensitivity at all, information that company people give out to\nalmost anybody who asks.\nThe First Call: The receptionist\nThe attacker, using the name Didi Sands, placed a call to the corporate\noffices of the cellular phone service. In part, the conversation went like\nthis:\nReceptionist: Good afternoon. This is Marie, how may I help you?\nDidi: Can you connect me to the Transportation Department?\nR: I’m not sure if we have one, I’ll look in my directory. Who’s calling?\nD: It’s Didi.\nR: Are you in the building, or... ?\nD: No, I’m outside the building.\nR: Didi who?\nD: Didi Sands. I had the extension for Transportation, but I forgot what\nit was.\nR: One moment.\nTo allay suspicions, at this point Didi asked a casual, just making\nconversation question designed to establish that she was on the \"inside,\"\nfamiliar with company locations.\nD: What building are you in - Lakeview or Main Place?\nR: Main Place. (pause) It’s 805 555 6469.\nTo provide herself with a backup in case the call to Transportation didn’t\nprovide what she was looking for, Didi said she also wanted to talk to\nReal Estate. The receptionist gave her that number, as well. When Didi\nasked to be connected to the Transportation number, the receptionist tried,\nbut the line was busy.\nAt that point Didi asked for a third phone number, for Accounts\nReceivable, located at a corporate facility in Austin, Texas. The\nreceptionist asked her to wait a moment, and went off the line. Reporting\nto Security that she had a suspicious phone call and thought there was\nsomething fishy going on? Not at all, and Didi didn’t have the least bit of\nconcern. She was being a bit of a nuisance, but to the receptionist it was\nall part of a typical workday. After about a minute, the receptionist came\nback on the line, looked up the Accounts Receivable number, tried it, and\nput Didi through.\nThe Second Call: Peggy\nThe next conversation went like this:\nPeggy: Accounts Receivable, Peggy.\nDidi: Hi, Peggy. This is Didi, in Thousand Oaks.\nP: Hi, Didi.\nD: How ya doing?\nP: Fine.\nDidi then used a familiar term in the corporate world that describes the\ncharge code for assigning expenses against the budget of a specific\norganization or workgroup:\nD: Excellent. I have a question for you. How do I find out the cost center\nfor a particular department?\nP: You’d have to get a hold of the budget analyst for the department.\nD: Do you know who’d be the budget analyst\nfor Thousand Oaks - headquarters? I’m trying to\nfill out a form and I don’t know the proper cost\ncenter.\nP: I just know when y’all need a cost center number, you call your\nbudget analyst.\nD: Do you have a cost center for your department there in Texas?\nP: We have our own cost center but they don’t give us a complete list of\nthem.\nD: How many digits is the cost center? FOr example, what’s your cost\ncenter?\nP: Well, like, are you with 9WC or with SAT?\nDidi had no idea what departments or groups these referred to, but it\ndidn’t matter. She answered:\n\nD: 9WC.\nP: Then it’s usually four digits. Who did you say you were with?\nD: Headquarters--Thousand Oaks.\nP: Well, here’s one for Thousand Oaks. It’s 1A5N, that’s N like in\nNancy.\nBy just hanging out long enough with somebody willing to be helpful,\nDidi had the cost center number she needed - one of those pieces of\ninformation that no one thinks to protect because it seems like something\nthat couldn’t be of any value to an outsider.\nThe Third Call: A Helpful Wrong Number\nDidi’s next step would be to parlay the cost center number into something\nof real value by using it as a poker chip.\nShe began by calling the Real Estate department, pretending she had\nreached a wrong number. Starting with a \"Sorry to bother you, but .... \"\nshe claimed she was an employee who had lost her company directory,\nand asked who you were supposed to call to get a new copy. The man said\nthe print copy was out of date because it was available on the company\nintranet site.\nDidi said she preferred using a hard copy, and the man told her to call\nPublications, and then, without being asked - maybe just to keep the sexy-\nsounding lady on the phone a little longer - helpfully looked up the\nnumber and gave it to her.\nThe Fourth Call: Bart in Publications\nIn Publications, she spoke with a man named Bart. Didi said she was from\nThousand Oaks, and they had a new consultant who needed a copy of the\ncompany directory. She told him a print copy would work better for the\nconsultant, even if it was somewhat out of date. Bart told her she’d have to\nfill out a requisition form and send the form over to him.\nDidi said she was out of forms and it was a rush, and could Bart be a\nsweetheart and fill out the form for her? He agreed with a little too much\nenthusiasm, and Didi gave him the details. For the address of the fictional\ncontractor, she drawled the number of what social engineers call a mail\ndrop, in this case a Mail Boxes Etc.-type of commercial business where\nher company rented boxes for situations just like this.\nThe earlier spadework now came in handy: There would be a charge for\nthe cost and shipping of the directory. Fine - Didi gave the cost center for\nThousand Oaks:\n\"IA5N, that’s N like in Nancy.\"\nA few days later, when the corporate directory arrived, Didi found it was\nan even bigger payoff than she had expected: It not only listed the names\nand phone numbers, but also showed who worked for whom - the\ncorporate structure of the whole organization.\nThe lady of the husky voice was ready to start making her head-hunter,\npeople-raiding phone calls. She had conned the information she needed to\nlaunch her raid using the gift of gab honed to a high polish by every\nskilled social engineer. Now she was ready for the payoff.\n\nLINGO\nMAIL DROP: The social engineer(cid:146)s term for a rental mailbox, typically\nrented under an assumed name, which is used to deliver documents or\npackages the victim has been duped into sending\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nJust like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, each piece of information may be\nirrelevant by itself. However, when the pieces are put together, a clear\npicture emerges. In this I case, the picture the social engineer saw was the\nentire internal structure of the company .\nAnalyzing the Con\nIn this social engineering attack, Didi started by getting phone numbers\nfor three departments in the target company. This was easy, because the\nnumbers she was asking for were no secret, especially to employees. A\nsocial engineer learns to sound like an insider, and Didi was skilled at this\ngame. One of the phone numbers led her to a cost center number, which\nshe then used to obtain a copy of the firm’s employee directory.\nThe main tools she needed: sounding friendly, using some corporate\nlingo, and, with the last victim, throwing in a little verbal eyelash-batting.\nAnd one more tool, an essential element not easily acquired - the\nmanipulative skills of the social engineer, refined through extensive\npractice and the unwritten lessons of bygone generations of confidence\nmen.\nMORE \"WORTHLESS\" INFO\nBesides a cost center number and internal phone extensions, what other\nseemingly useless information can be extremely valuable to your enemy?.\nPeter Abel(cid:146)s Phone Call\n\"Hi,\" the voice at the other end of the line says. \"This is Tom at Parkhurst\nTravel. Your tickets to San Francisco are ready. Do you want us to deliver\nthem, or do you want to pick them up?\"\n\"San Francisco?\" Peter says. \"I’m not going to San Francisco.\" \"Is this\nPeter Abels?\"\n\"Yes, but I don’t have any trips coming up.\"\n\"Well,\" the caller says with a friendly laugh, \"you sure you don’t want to\ngo to San Francisco?\"\n\"If you think you can talk my boss into it...\" Peter says, playing along\nwith the friendly conversation.\n\"Sounds like a mix-up,\" the caller says. \"On our system, we book travel\narrangements under the employee number. Maybe somebody used the\nwrong number. What’s your employee number?\"\nPeter obligingly recites his number. And why not? It goes on just about\nevery personnel form he fills out, lots of people in the company have\naccess to it - human resources, payroll, and, obviously, the outside travel\nagency. No one treats an employee number like some sort of secret. What\ndifference could it make?\nThe answer isn’t hard to figure out. Two or three pieces of information\nmight be all it takes to mount an effective impersonation - the social\nengineer cloaking himself in someone else’s identity. Get hold of an\nemployee’s name, his phone number, his employee number--and maybe,\nfor good measure, his manager’s name and phone number--and a halfway-\ncompetent social engineer is equipped with most of what he’s likely to\nneed to sound authentic to the next target he calls.\nIf someone who said he was from another department in your company\nhad called yesterday, given a plausible reason, and asked for your\nemployee number, would you have had any reluctance in giving it to him?\nAnd by the way, what is your social security number?\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nThe moral of the story is, don’t give out any personal or internal company\ninformation or identifiers to anyone, unless his or her voice is\nrecognizable and the requestor has a need to know.\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nYour company has a responsibility to make employees aware of how a\nserious mistake can occur from mishandling non public information. A\nwell thought-out information security policy, combined with proper\neducation and training, will dramatically increase employee awareness\nabout the proper handling of corporate business information. A data\nclassification policy will help you to implement proper controls with\nrespect to disclosing information. Without a data classification policy, all\ninternal information must be considered confidential, unless otherwise\nspecified.\nTake these steps to protect your company from the release of seemingly\ninnocuous information:\nThe Information Security Department needs to conduct awareness training\ndetailing the methods used by social engineers. One method, as described\nabove, is to obtain seemingly non sensitive information and use it as a\npoker chip to gain short-term trust. Each and every employee needs to be\naware that when a caller has knowledge about company procedures, lingo,\nand internal identifiers it does not in any way, shape, or form authenticate\nthe requestor or authorize him or her as having a need to know. A caller\ncould be a former employee or\ncontractor with the requisite insider information. Accordingly, each\ncorporation has a responsibility to determine the appropriate\nauthentication method to be used when employees interact with people\nthey don’t recognize in person or over the telephone.\nThe person or persons with the role and responsibility of drafting a data\nclassification policy should examine the types of details that may be used\nto gain access for legitimate employees that seem innocuous, but could\nlead to information that is, sensitive. Though you’d never give out the\naccess codes for your ATM card, would you tell somebody what server\nyou use to develop company software products? Could that information\nbe used by a person pretending to be somebody who has legitimate access\nto the corporate network?\nSometimes just knowing inside terminology can make the social engineer\nappear authoritative and knowledgeable. The attacker often relies on this\ncommon misconception to dupe his or her victims into compliance. For\nexample, a Merchant ID is an identifier that people in the New Accounts\ndepartment of a bank casually use every day. But such an identifier\nexactly the same as a password. If each and every employee understands\nthe nature of this identifier - that it is used to positively authenticate a\nrequestor--they might treat it with more respect.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nAs the old adage goes - even real paranoids probably have enemies. We\nmust assume that every business has its enemies, too - attackers that target\nthe network infrastructure to compromise business secrets. Don’t end up\nbeing a statistic on computer crime - it’s high time to shore up the\nnecessary defenses by implementing proper controls through well-\nthought-out security policies and procedures.\nNo companies - well, very few, at least - give out the direct dial phone\nnumbers of their CEO or board chairman. Most companies, though, have\nno concern about giving out phone numbers to most departments and\nworkgroups in the, organization - especially to someone who is, or\nappears to be, an employee. A possible countermeasure: Implement a\npolicy\nthat prohibits giving internal phone numbers of employees, contractors,\nconsultants, and temps to outsiders. More importantly, develop a step-by-\nstep procedure to positively identify whether a caller asking for phone\nnumbers is really an employee.\nAccounting codes for workgroups and departments, as well as copies of\nthe corporate directory (whether hard copy, data file, or electronic phone\nbook on the intranet) are frequent targets of social engineers. Every\ncompany needs a written, well-publicized policy on disclosure of this type\nof information. The safeguards should include maintaining an audit log\nthat records instances when sensitive information is disclosed to people\noutside of the company.\nInformation such as an employee number, by itself, should not be used as\nany sort of authentication. Every employee must be trained to verify not\njust the identity of a requestor, but also the requestor’s need to know.\nIn your security training, consider teaching employees this approach:\nWhenever asked a question or asked for a favor by a stranger, learn first\nto politely decline until the request can be verified. Then - before giving\nin to the natural desire to be Mr. or Ms. Helpful - follow company policies\nand procedures with respect to verification and disclosure of non public\ninformation. This style may go against our natural tendency to help\nothers, but a little healthy paranoia may be necessary to avoid being the\nsocial engineer’s next dupe.\nAs the stories in this chapter have shown, seemingly innocuous\ninformation can be the key to your company’s most prized secrets.",
    "question": "What is the key concept discussed in the text regarding the value of seemingly innocuous information in social engineering attacks?",
    "summary": "Social engineers often exploit seemingly harmless information to gain access to sensitive data. In the case of CreditChex, a private investigator used this tactic to obtain a client's bank details, which helped identify where the client's husband had hidden assets. Similarly, in another example, an employment agency used corporate lingo and internal details to find engineers, demonstrating how even ordinary information can be valuable to attackers. Companies must be vigilant and treat all internal data with care, as it can be used to compromise security if not properly protected."

    "text": "Chapter 3\nThe Direct Attack: Just Asking for It\nMany social engineering attacks are intricate, involving a number of steps\nand elaborate planning, combining a mix of manipulation and\ntechnological know-how.\nBut I always find it striking that a skillful social engineer can often\nachieve his goal with a simple, straightforward, direct attack. Just asking\noutright for the information may be all that’s needed - as you’ll see.\n\nAN MLAC QUICKIE\nWant to know someone’s unlisted phone number? A social engineer can\ntell you half a dozen ways (and you’ll find some of them described in\nother stories in these pages), but probably the simplest scenario is one that\nuses a single phone call, like this one.\nNumber, Please\nThe attacker dialed the private phone company number for the MLAC, the\nMechanized Line Assignment Center. To the woman who answered, he\nsaid:\n\"Hey, this is Paul Anthony. I’m a cable splicer. Listen, a terminal box out\nhere got fried in a fire. Cops think some creep tried to burn his own house\ndown for the insurance. They got me out here alone trying to rewire this\nentire two hundred-pair terminal. I could really use some help right now.\nWhat facilities should be working at 6723 South Main?\"\nIn other parts of the phone company, the person called would know that\nreverse lookup information on non pub (non published) numbers is\nsupposed to be given out only to authorized phone company MLAC is\nsupposed to be known only to company employees. And while they’d\nnever give out information to the public, who would want to refuse a little\nhelp to a company man coping with that heavy-duty assignment?. She\nfeels sorry for him, she’s had bad days on the job herself, and she(cid:146)ll\nbend the rules a little to help out a fellow employee with a problem. She\ngives him the cable and pairs and each working number assigned to the\naddress.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nIt’s human nature to trust our fellow man, especially when the request\nmeets the test of being reasonable. Social engineers use this knowledge to\nexploit their victims and to achieve their goals.\nAnalyzing the Con\nAs you’ll notice repeatedly in these stories, knowledge of a company(cid:146)s\nlingo, and of its corporate structure - its various offices and departments\nwhat each does and what information each has - is part of the essential\nbag of tricks of the successful social engineer.\n\nYOUNG MAN ON THE RUN\nA man we’ll call Frank Parsons had been on the run for years, still wanted\nby the federal government for being part of an underground antiwar group\nin the 1960s. In restaurants he sat facing the door and he had a way of\nglancing over his shoulder every once in a while that other people found\ndisconcerting. He moved every few years.\nAt one point Frank landed in a city he didn’t know, and set about job\nhunting. For someone like Frank, with his well-developed computer skills\n(and social engineering skills as well, even ,though he never listed those\non a job application), finding a good job usually wasn’t a problem. Except\nin times when the economy is very tight, people with good technical\ncomputer knowledge usually find their talents in high demand and they\nhave little problem landing on their feet. Frank quickly located a well (cid:150)\npaying job opportunity at a large, upscale, long-term care facility near\nwhere he was living.\nJust the ticket, he thought. But when he started plodding his way through\nthe application forms, he came upon an uh-oh: The employer required the\napplicant to provide a copy of his state criminal history record, which he\nhad to obtain himself from the state police. The stack of employment\npapers included a form to request this document, and the form had a little\nbox for providing a fingerprint. Even though they were asking for a print\nof just the right index finger, if they matched his print with one in the\nFBI’s database, he’d probably soon be working in food service at a\nfederally funded resort.\nOn the other hand, it occurred to Frank that maybe, just maybe, he might\nstill be able to get away with this. Perhaps the state didn’t send those\nfingerprint samples to the FBI at all. How could he find out?\nHow? He was a social engineer--how do you think he found out? He\nplaced a phone call to the state patrol: \"Hi. We’re doing a study for the\nState Department of Justice. We’re researching the requirements to\nimplement a new fingerprint identification system. Can I talk to\nsomebody there that’s really familiar with what you’re doing who could\nmaybe help us out?\"\nAnd when the local expert came on the phone, Frank asked a series of\nquestions about what systems they were using, and the capabilities to\nsearch and store fingerprint data. Had they had any equipment problems?\nWere they tied into the National Crime Information Center’s (NCIC)\nFingerprint Search or just within the state? Was the equipment pretty easy\nfor everybody to learn to use?\nSlyly, he sneaked the key question in among the rest.\nThe answer was music to his ears: No they weren’t tied into the NCIC,\nthey only checked against the state’s Criminal Information Index (CII).\n\nMITNICK MESSGAE\nSavvy information swindlers have no qualms about ringing up federal,\nstate, or local government officials to learn about the procedures of law\nenforcement. With such information in hand, the social engineer may be\nable to circumvent your company’s standard security checks.\nThat was all Frank needed to know. He didn’t have any record in that\nstate, so he submitted his application, was hired for the job, and nobody\never showed up at his desk one day with the greeting, \"These gentlemen,\nare from the FBI and they’d like to have a little talk with you.\"\nAnd, according to him, he proved to be a model employee.\n\nON THE DOORSTEP\nIn spite of the myth of the paperless office, companies continue to print\nout reams of paper every day. Information in print at your company may\nbe vulnerable, even if you use security precautions and stamp it\nconfidential.\nHere’s one story that shows you how social engineers might obtain your\nmost secret documents.\nLoop-Around Deception\nEvery year the phone company publishes a volume called the Test\nNumber Directory (or at least they used to, and because I am still on\nsupervised release, I’m not going to ask if they still do). This document\nwas highly prized by phone phreaks because it was packed with a list of\nall the closely guarded phone numbers used by company craftsmen,\ntechnicians, a others for things like trunk testing or checking numbers that\nalways ring busy.\nOne of these test numbers, known in the lingo as a loop-around, was\nparticularly useful. Phone phreaks used it as a way to find other phone\nphreaks to chat with, at no cost to them. Phone phreaks also used it a way\nto create a call back number to give to, say, a bank. A social engineer\nwould tell somebody at the bank the phone number to call to reach at his\noffice. When the bank called back to the test number (loop-around) the\nphone phreak would be able to receive the call, yet he had the protection\nof having used a phone number that could not be traced back to him.\nA Test Number Directory provided a lot of neat information that could be\nused by any information-hungry, testosteroned, phone phreak. So when\nthe new directories were published each year, they were coveted by a lot\nof youngsters whose hobby was exploring the telephone network.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nSecurity training with respect to company policy designed to protect\ninformation assets needs to be for everyone in the company, not just any\nemployee who has electronic or physical access to the company’s IT\nassets.\nStevie(cid:146)s Scam\nNaturally phone companies don’t make these books easy to get hold of, so\nphone phreaks have to be creative to get one. How can they do this? An\neager youngster with a mind bent on acquiring the directory might enact a\nscenario like this.\nLate one day, a mild evening in the southern California autumn, a guy I’ll\ncall him Stevie phones a small telephone company central office, which is\nthe building from which phone lines run to all the homes and businesses\nin the established service area.\nWhen the switchman on duty answers the call, Stevie announces that he’s\nfrom the division of the phone company that publishes and distributes\nprinted materials. \"We have your new Test Number Directory,\" he says.\n\"But for security reasons, we cant deliver your copy until we pick up the\nold one. And the delivery guy is running late. If you wanna leave your\ncopy just outside your door, he can swing by, pick up yours, drop the new\none and be on his way.\"\nThe unsuspecting switchman seems to think that sounds reasonable. He\ndoes exactly as asked, putting out on the doorstep of the building his copy\nof the directory, its cover clearly marked in big red letters with the\n\"COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL - WHEN NO LONGER NEEDED\nTHIS DOCUMENT MUST BE SHREDDED.\"\nStevie drives by and looks around carefully to spot any cops or phone\ncompany security people who might be lurking behind trees or watching\nfor him from parked cars. Nobody in sight. He casually picks up the\ncoveted directory and drives away.\nHere’s just one more example of how easy it can be for a social engineer\nto get what he wants by following the simple principle of \"just ask for it.\"\n\nGAS ATTACK\nNot only company assets are at risk in a social engineering scenario.\nSometimes it’s a company’s customers who are the victims.\nWorking as a customer-service clerk brings its share of frustrations, its\nshare of laughs, and its share of innocent mistakes - some of which can\nhave unhappy consequences for a company’s customers.\nJanie Acton’s Story\nJanie Acton had been manning a cubicle as a customer service rep f\nHometown Electric Power, in Washington, D.C., for just over three years.\nShe was considered to be one of the better clerks, smart and conscientious\nIt was Thanksgiving week when this one particular call came in. The\ncaller, said, \"This is Eduardo in the Billing Department. I’ve got a lady on\nhold, she’s a secretary in the executive offices that works for one of the\nvice presidents, and she’s asking for some information and I can’t use my\ncomputer I got an email from this girl in Human Resources that said\n’ILOVEYOU.(cid:146) and when I opened the attachment, I couldn’t use my\nmachine any more. A virus. I got caught by a stupid virus. Anyways,\ncould you look up some customer information for me?\"\n\"Sure,\" Janie answered. \"It crashed your computer? That’s terrible.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"How can I help?\" Janie asked.\nHere the attacker called on information from his advance research to\nmake himself sound authentic. He had learned that the information he,\nwanted was stored in something called the Customer Billing Information\nSystem, and he had found out how employees referred to the system. He\nasked, \"Can you bring up an account on CBIS?\"\n\"Yes, what’s the account number.? \"\n\"I don’t have the number; I need you to bring it up by name.\"\n\"Okay, what’s the name?\"\n\"It’s Heather Marning.\" He spelled the name, and Janie typed it in.\n\"Okay, I have it up.\"\n\"Great. Is the account current?\"\n\"Uh huh, it’s current.\"\n\"What’s the account number?\" he asked.\n\"Do you have a pencil?\"\n\"Ready to write.\"\n\"Account number BAZ6573NR27Q.\"\nHe read the number back and then said, \"And what’s the service\naddress?\"\nShe gave him the address.\n\"And what’s the phone?\"\nJanie obligingly read off that information, too.\nThe caller thanked her, said good-bye, and hung up. Janie went on to the\nnext call, never thinking further about it.\nArt Sealy’s Research Project\nArt Sealy had given up working as a freelance editor for small publishing\nhouses when he found he could make more money doing research for\nwriters and businesses. He soon figured out that the fee he could charge\nwent up in proportion to how close the assignment took him to the\nsometimes hazy line between the legal and the illegal. Without ever\nrealizing it, certainly without ever giving it a name, Art became a social\nengineer, using techniques familiar to every information broker. He\nturned out to have a native talent for the business, figuring out for himself\ntechniques that most social engineers had to learn from others. After a\nwhile, he crossed the line without the least twinge of guilt.\nA man contacted me who was writing a book about the Cabinet in the\nNixon years, and was looking for a researcher who could get the inside\nscoop on William E. Simon, who had been Nixon’s Treasury secretary.\nMr. Simon had died, but the author had the name of a woman who had\nbeen on his staff. He was pretty sure she still lived in D.C., but hadn’t\nbeen able to get an address. She didn’t have a telephone in her name, or at\nleast none that was listed. So that’s when he called me. I told him, sure, no\nproblem.\nThis is the kind of job you can usually bring off in a phone call or two, if\nyou know what you’re doing. Every local utility company can generally\nbe counted on to give the information away. Of course, you have to BS a\nlittle. But what’s a little white lie now and then - right?\nI like to use a different approach each time, just to keep things interesting.\n\"This is so-and-so in the executive offices\" has always worked well for\nme. So has \"I’ve got somebody on the line from Vice President\nSomebody’s office,\" which worked this time, too.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nNever think all social engineering attacks need to be\nelaborate ruses so complex that they’re likely to be\nrecognized before they can be completed. Some are in- and-\nout, strike-and-disappear, very simple attacks that are no\nmore than.., well, just asking for it.\nYou have to sort of develop the social engineer’s instinct, get a sense of\nhow cooperative the person on the other end is going to be with you. This\ntime I lucked out with a friendly, helpful lady. In a single phone call, I had\nthe address and phone number. Mission accomplished.\nAnalyzing the Con\nCertainly Janie knew that customer information is sensitive. She would\nnever discuss one customer’s account with another customer, or give out\nprivate information to the public.\nBut naturally, for a caller from within the company, different rules apply.\nFor a fellow employee it’s all about being a team player and helping each\nother get the job done. The man from Billing could have looked up the\ndetails himself if his computer hadn’t been down with a virus, and she was\nglad to be able to help a co-worker.\nArt built up gradually to the key information he was really after, asking\nquestions along the way about things he didn’t really need, such as the\naccount number. Yet at the same time, the account number information\nprovided a fallback: If the clerk had become suspicious, he’d call a\nsecond\ntime and stand a better chance of success, because knowing the account\nnumber would make him sound all the more authentic to the next clerk\nhe reached.\nIt never occurred to Janie that somebody might actually lie about some\nthing like this, that the caller might not really be from the billing\ndepartment\nat all. Of course, the blame doesn’t lie at Janie’s feet. She wasn’t well\nversed in the rule about making sure you know who you’re talking to\nbefore discussing information in a customer’s file. Nobody had ever told\nher about the danger of a phone call like the one from Art. It wasn’t in the\ncompany policy, it wasn’t part of her training, and her supervisor had\nnever mentioned it.\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nA point to include in your security training: Just because a caller or visitor\nknows the names of some people in the company, or knows some of the\ncorporate lingo or procedures, doesn’t mean he is who he claims to be.\nAnd it definitely doesn’t establish him as anybody authorized to be given\ninternal information, or access to your computer system or network.\nSecurity training needs to emphasize: When in doubt, verify, verify,\nverify.\nIn earlier times, access to information within a company was a mark of\nrank and privilege. Workers stoked the furnaces, ran the machines, typed\nthe letters, and filed the reports. The foreman or boss told them what to\ndo, when, and how. It was the foreman or boss who knew how many\nwidgets each worker should be producing on a shift, how many and in\nwhat colors and sizes the factory needed to turn out this week, next week,\nand by the end of the month.\nWorkers handled machines and tools and materials, and bosses handled\ninformation. Workers needed only the information specific to their\nspecific jobs.\nThe picture is a little different today, isn’t it? Many factory workers use\nsome form of computer or computer-driven machine. For a large part of\nthe workforce, critical information is pushed down to the users’ desktops\nso that they can fulfill their responsibility to get their work done. In\ntoday’s environment, almost everything employees do involves the\nhandling of information.\nThat’s why a company’s security policy needs to be distributed enterprise-\nwide, regardless of position. Everybody must understand that it’s not just\nthe bosses and executives who have the information that an attacker might\nbe after. Today, workers at every level, even those who don’t use a\ncomputer, are liable to be targeted. The newly hired rep in the customer\nservice group may be just the weak link that a social engineer breaks to\nachieve his objective.\nSecurity training and corporate security policies need to strengthen that\nlink.",

    "text": "Chapter 4\nBuilding Trust\nSome of these stories might lead you to think that I believe everyone in\nbusiness is a complete idiot, ready, even eager, to give away every secret\nin his or her possession. The social engineer knows isn’t true. Why are\nsocial engineering attacks so successful? It isn’t because people are stupid\nor lack common sense. But we, as human beings are all vulnerable to\nbeing deceived because people can misplace their trust if manipulated in\ncertain ways.\nThe social engineer anticipates suspicion and resistance, and he’s always\nprepared to turn distrust into trust. A good social engineer plans his attack\nlike a chess game, anticipating the questions his target might ask so he can\nbe ready with the proper answers.\nOne of his common techniques involves building a sense of trust on the\npart of his victims. How does a con man make you trust him? Trust me,\nhe can.\n\nTRUST: THE KEY TO DECEPTION\nThe more a social engineer can make his contact seem like business as\nusual, the more he allays suspicion. When people don’t have a reason to\nbe suspicious, it’s easy for a social engineer to gain their trust.\nOnce he’s got your trust, the drawbridge is lowered and the castle door\nthrown open so he can enter and take whatever information he wants.\n\nNOTE\nYou may notice I refer to social engineers, phone phreaks, and con-\ngame operators as ’he\" through most of these stories. This is not\nchauvinism; it simply reflects the truth that most practitioners in\nthese fields are male. But though there aren(cid:146)t many women social\nengineers, the number is growing. There are enough female social\nengineers out there that you shouldn(cid:146)t let your guard down just\nbecause you hear a women(cid:146)s voice. In fact, female social engineers\nhave a distinct advantage because they can use their sexuality to\nobtain cooperation. You(cid:146)ll find a small number of the so-called\ngentler sex represented in these pages\nThe First Call: Andrea Lopez\nAndrea Lopez answered the phone at the video rental store where she\nworked, and in a moment was smiling: It’s always a pleasure when a\ncustomer takes the trouble to say he’s happy about the service. This caller\nsaid he had had a very good experience dealing with the store, and he\nwanted to send the manager a letter about it.\nHe asked for the manager’s name and the mailing address, and she told\nhim it was Tommy Allison, and gave him the address. As he was about to\nhang up, he had another idea and said, \"I might want to write to your\ncompany headquarters, too. What’s your store number?\" She gave him\nthat information, as well. He said thanks, added something pleasant about\nhow helpful she had been, and said goodbye.\n\"A call like that,\" she thought, \"always seems to make the shift go by\nfaster. How nice it would be if people did that more often.\"\nThe Second Call: Ginny\n\"Thanks for calling Studio Video. This is Ginny, how can I help you?\"\n\"Hi, Ginny,\" the caller said enthusiastically, sounding as if he talked to\nGinny every week or so. \"It’s Tommy Allison, manager at Forest Park,\nStore 863. We have a customer in here who wants to rent Rocky 5 and\nwe’re all out of copies. Can you check on what you’ve got?\"\nShe came back on the line after a few moments and said, \"Yeah, we’ve\ngot three copies.\"\n\"Okay, I’ll see if he wants to drive over there. Listen, thanks. If you ever\nneed any help from our store, just call and ask for Tommy. I’ll be glad to\ndo whatever I can for you.\"\nThree or four times over the next couple of weeks, Ginny got calls from\nTommy for help with one thing or another. They were seemingly\nlegitimate requests, and he was always very friendly without sounding\nlike he was trying to come on to her. He was a little chatty along the way,\nas well - \"Did you hear about the big fire in Oak Park? Bunch of streets\nclosed over there,\" and the like. The calls were a little break from the\nroutine of the day, and Ginny was always glad to hear from him.\nOne day Tommy called sounding stressed. He asked, \"Have\nyou guys been having trouble with your computers?\"\n\"No,\" Ginny answered. \"Why?\"\n\"Some guy crashed his car into a telephone pole, and the phone company\nrepairman says a whole part of the city will lose their phones and Internet\nconnection till they get this fixed.\"\n\"Oh, no. Was the man hurt?\"\n\"They took him away in an ambulance. Anyway, I could use a little help.\nI’ve got a customer of yours here who wants to rent Godfather II and\ndoesn’t have his card with him. Could you verify his information for me?\"\n\"Yeah, sure.\"\nTommy gave the customer’s name and address, and Ginny\nfound him in the computer. She gave Tommy the\naccount number.\n\"Any late returns or balance owed?\" Tommy asked.\n\"Nothing showing.\"\n\"Okay, great. I’ll sign him up by hand for an account here and put it in our\ndatabase later on when the computers come back up again. And he wants\nto put this charge on the Visa card he uses at your store, and he doesn’t\nhave it with him. What’s the card number and expiration date?\"\nShe gave it to him, along with the expiration date. Tommy said, \"Hey,\nthanks for the help. Talk to you soon,\" and hung up.\nDoyle Lonnegan’s Story\nLonnegan is not a young man you would want to find waiting when you\nopen your front door. A one-time collection man for bad gambling debts,\nhe still does an occasional favor, if it doesn’t put him out very much. In\nthis case, he was offered a sizable bundle of cash for little more than\nmaking\nsome phone calls to a video store. Sounds easy enough. It’s just that none\nof his \"customers\" knew how to run this con; they needed somebody with\nLonnegan’s talent and know-how.\nPeople don’t write checks to cover their bets when they’re unlucky or\nstupid\nat the poker table. Everybody knows that. Why did these friends of\nmine keep on playing with a cheat that didn’t have green out on the table?\nDon’t ask. Maybe they’re a little light in the IQ department. But they’re\nfriends of mine--what can you do?\nThis guy didn’t have the money, so they took a check. I ask you! Should\nof drove him to an ATM machine, is what they should of done. But no,\na check. For $3,230.\nNaturally, it bounced. What would you expect? So then they call me;\ncan I help? I don’t close doors on people’s knuckles any more. Besides,\nthere are better ways nowadays. I told them, 30 percent commission, I’d\nsee what I could do. So they give me his name and address, and I go up\non the computer to see what’s the closest video store to him.\nI wasn’t in a big hurry. Four phone calls to cozy up to the store manager,\nand then, bingo, I’ve got the cheat’s Visa card number.\nAnother friend of mine owns a topless bar. For fifty bucks, he put the\nguy’s poker money through as a Visa charge from the bar. Let the cheat\nexplain that to his wife. You think he might try to tell Visa it’s not his\ncharge? Think again. He knows we know who he is. And if we could get\nhis Visa number, he’ll figure we could get a lot more besides. No worries\non that score.\nAnalyzing the Con\nTommy’s initial calls to Ginny were simply to build up trust. When time\ncame for the actual attack, she let her guard down and accepted Tommy\nfor who he claimed to be, the manager at another store in the chain.\nAnd why wouldn’t she accept him--she already knew him. She’d only\nmet him over the telephone, of course, but they had established a business\nfriendship that is the basis for trust. Once she had accepted him as an\nauthority figure, a manager in the same company, the trust had been\nestablished and the rest was a walk in the park.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nThe sting technique of building trust is one of the most effective social\nengineering tactics. You have to think whether you really know the person\nyou’re talking to. In some rare instances, the person might not be who he\nclaims to be. Accordingly, we all have to learn to observe, think, and\nquestion authority.\n\nVARIATION ON A THEME: CARD CAPTURE\nBuilding a sense of trust doesn’t necessarily demand a series of phone\ncalls with the victim, as suggested by the previous story. I recall one\nincident I witnessed where five minutes was all it took.\nSurprise, Dad\nI once sat at a table in a restaurant with Henry and his father. In the course\nof conversation, Henry scolded his father for giving out his credit card\nnumber as if it were his phone number. \"Sure, you have to give your card\nnumber when you buy something,\" he said. \"But giving it to a store that\nfiles your number in their records - that’s real dumb.\"\nThe only place I do that is at Studio Video,\" Mr. Conklin said, naming\nthe same chain of video stores. \"But I go over my Visa bill every month.\nIf they started running up charges, I’d know it.\nSure,\" said Henry, \"but once they have your number, it’s so easy for\nsomebody to steal it \"\nYou mean a crooked employee.\"\nNo, anybody - not just an employee.\"\nYou’re talking through your hat,\" Mr. Conklin said.\nI can call up right now and get them to tell me your Visa number,\" Henry\nshot back.\nNo, you can’t, \"his father said.\n\"I can do it in five minutes, right here in front of you without ever leaving\nthe table.\"\nMr. Conklin looked tight around the eyes, the look of somebody feeling\nsure of himself, but not wanting to show it. \"I say you don’t know that\nyou’re talking about,\" he barked, taking out his wallet and slapping fifty\ndollar bill down on the table. \"If you can do what you say, that’s\nyours.\n\"I don’t want your money, Dad,\" Henry said.\nHe pulled out his cell phone, asked his father which branch he used, and\ncalled Directory Assistance for the phone number, as well as the number\nof the store in nearby Sherman Oaks.\nHe then called the Sherman Oaks store. Using pretty much the same\napproach described in the previous story, he quickly got the manager’s\nname and the store number.\nThen he called the store where his father had an account. He pulled the\nold impersonate-the-manager trick, using the manager’s name as his own\nand giving the store number he had just obtained. Then he used the same\nruse: \"Are your computers working okay? Ours have been up and down.\"\nHe listened to her reply and then said, \"Well, look, I’ve got one of your\ncustomers here who wants to rent a video, but our computers are down\nright now. I need you to look up the customer account and make sure he’s\na customer at your branch.\"\nHenry gave him his father’s name. Then, using only a slight variation in\ntechnique, he made the request to read off the account information:\naddress, phone number, and date the account was opened. And then he\nsaid, \"Hey, listen, I’m holding up a long line of customers here. What’s\nthe\ncredit card number and expiration date?\"\nHenry held the cell phone to his ear with one hand while he wrote on a\npaper napkin with the other. As he finished the call, he slid the napkin in\nfront of his father, who stared at it with his mouth hanging open. The\nto poor guy looked totally shocked, as if his whole system of trust had\njust\ngone down the drain.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThink of your own attitude when somebody you don’t know asks you for\nsomething. If a shabby stranger comes to your door, you’re not likely to\nlet him in; if a stranger comes to your door nicely dressed, shoes shined,\nhair perfect, with polite manner and a smile, you’re likely to be much less\nsuspicious. Maybe he’s really Jason from the Friday the 13th movies, but\nyou’re willing to start out trusting that person as long as he looks normal\nand doesn’t have a carving knife in his hand.\nWhat’s less obvious is that we judge people on the telephone the same\nway. Does this person sound like he’s trying to sell me something? Is he\nfriendly and outgoing or do I sense some kind of hostility or pressure?\nDoes he or she have the speech of an educated person? We judge these\nthings and perhaps a dozen others unconsciously, in a flash, often in the\nfirst few moments of the conversation.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nIt’s human nature to think that it’s unlikely you’re being deceived in any\nparticular transaction, at least until you have some reason to believe\notherwise. We weigh the risks and then, most of the time, give people the\nbenefit of the doubt. That’s the natural behavior of civilized people.., at\nleast civilized people who have never been conned or manipulated or\ncheated out of a large amount of money.\nAs children our parents taught us not to trust strangers. Maybe we should\nall heed this age-old principle in today’s workplace.\nAt work, people make requests of us all the time. Do you have an email\naddress for this guy? Where’s the latest version of the customer list?\nWho’s the subcontractor on this part of the project? Please send me the\nlatest project update. I need the new version of the source code.\nAnd guess what: Sometimes people who make those requests are people\nyour don’t personally know, folks who work for some other part of the\ncompany, or claim they do. But if the information they give checks out,\nand they appear to be in the know (\"Marianne said . . .\"; \"It’s on the K-16\nserver...\"; \"... revision 26 of the new product plans\"), we extend our circle\nof trust to include them, and blithely give them what they’re asking for.\nSure, we may stumble a little, asking ourselves \"Why does somebody in\nthe Dallas plant need to see the new product plans?\" or \"Could it hurt\nanything to give out the name of the server it’s on?\" So we ask another\nquestion or two. If the answers appear reasonable and the person’s manner\nis reassuring, we let down our guard, return to our natural inclination to\ntrust our fellow man or woman, and do (within reason) whatever it is\nwe’re being asked to do.\nAnd don’t think for a moment that the attacker will only target people ’ho\nuse company computer systems. What about the guy in the mail room?\n\"Will you do me a quick favor? Drop this into the intra company mail\npouch?\" Does the mail room clerk know it contains a floppy disk with a\nspecial little program for the CEO’s secretary? Now that attacker gets his\nown personal copy of the CEO’s email. Wow! Could that really happen at\nyour company? The answer is, absolutely.\n\nTHE ONE-CENT CELL PHONE\nMany people look around until the); find a better deal; social engineers\ndon’t look for a better deal, they find a way to make a deal better. For\nexample, sometimes a company launches a marketing campaign that’s so\nyou can hardly bear to pass it up, while the social engineer looks at the\noffer and wonders how he can sweeten the deal.\nNot long ago, a nationwide wireless company had a major promotion\nunderway offering a brand-new phone for one cent when you signed up\nfor one of their calling plans.\nAs lots of people have discovered too late, there are a good many\nquestions a prudent shopper should ask before signing up for a cell phone\ncalling plan whether the service is analog, digital, or a combination; the\nnumber of anytime minutes you can use in a month; whether roaming\ncharges are included.., and on, and on. Especially important to understand\nup front is the contract term of commitment--how many months or years\nwill you have to commit to?\nPicture a social engineer in Philadelphia who is attracted by a cheap\nphone model offered by a cellular phone company on sign-up, but he\nhates the calling plan that goes with it. Not a problem. Here’s one way he\nmight handle the situation.\nThe First Call: Ted\nFirst, the social engineer dials an electronics chain store on West Girard.\n\"Electron City. This is Ted.\"\n\"Hi, Ted. This is Adam. Listen, I was in a few nights ago talking to a\nsales guy about a cell phone. I said I’d call him back when I decided on\nthe plan I wanted, and I forgot his name. Who’s the guy who works in that\ndepartment on the night shift?\n\"There’s more than one. Was it William?\"\n\"I’m not sure. Maybe it was William. What’s he look like?\" \"Tall guy.\nKind of skinny.\"\n\"I think that’s him. What’s his last name, again?\n\"Hadley. H--A--D--L--E-- Y.\"\n\"Yeah, that sounds right. When’s he going to be on?\"\n\"Don’t know his schedule this week, but the evening people come in about\nfive.\"\n\"Good. I’ll try him this evening, then. Thanks, Ted.\"\nThe Second Call: Katie\nThe next call is to a store of the same chain on North Broad Street.\n\"Hi, Electron City. Katie speaking, how can I help you?\"\n\"Katie, hi. This is William Hadley, over at the West Girard store. How’re\nyou today?\"\n\"Little slow, what’s up?\"\n\"I’ve got a customer who came in for that one-cent cell phone program.\nYou know the one I mean?\"\n\"Right. I sold a couple of those last week.\"\n\"You still have some of the phones that go with that plan?\"\n\"Got a stack of them.\"\n\"Great. ’Cause I just sold one to a customer. The guy passed credit; we\nsigned him up on the contract. I checked the damned inventory and we\ndon’t have any phones left. I’m so embarrassed. Can you do me a favor?\nI’ll send him over to your store to pick up a phone. Can you sell him the\nphone for one cent and write him up a receipt? And he’s supposed to call\nme back once he’s got the phone so I can talk him through how to\nprogram it.\"\n\"Yeah, sure. Send him over.\"\n\"Okay. His name is Ted. Ted Yancy.\"\nWhen the guy who calls himself Ted Yancy shows up at the\nNorth Broad St. store, Katie writes up an invoice and sells him\nthe cell phone for one cent, just as she had been asked to do\nby her \"co worker.\" She fell for the con hook, line, and sinker.\nWhen it’s time to pay, the customer doesn’t have any pennies in his\npocket, so he reaches into the little dish of pennies at the cashier’s counter,\ntakes one out, and gives it to the girl at the register. He gets the phone\nwithout paying even the one cent for it.\nHe’s then free to go to another wireless company that uses the same model\nof phone, and choose any service plan he likes. Preferably one on a\nmonth-to-month basis, with no commitment required.\nAnalyzing the Con\nIts natural for people to have a higher degree of acceptance for anyone\nwho claims to be a fellow employee, and who knows company procedures\n,d lingo. The social engineer in this story took advantage of that by\nfinding out the details of a promotion, identifying himself as a company\nemployee, and asking for a favor from another branch. This happens\nbetween branches of retail stores and between departments in a company,\npeople are physically separated and deal with fellow employees they have\nnever actually met day in and day out.\n\nHACKING INTO THE FEDS\nPeople often don’t stop to think about what materials their organization is\nmaking available on the Web. For my weekly show on KFI Talk Radio in\nLos Angeles, the producer did a search on line and found a copy of an\ninstruction manual for accessing-the database of the National Crime\nInformation Center. Later he found the actual NCIC manual itself on line,\na sensitive document that gives all the instructions for retrieving\ninformation from the FBI’s national crime database.\nThe manual is a handbook for law enforcement agencies that gives the\nformatting and codes for retrieving information on criminals and crimes\nfrom the national database. Agencies all over the country can search the\nsame database for information to help solve crimes in their own\njurisdiction. The manual contains the codes used in the database for\ndesignating everything from different kinds of tattoos, to different boat\nhulls, to denominations of stolen money and bonds.\nAnybody with access to the manual can look up the syntax and the\ncommands to extract information from the national database. Then,\nfollowing instructions from the procedures guide, with a little nerve,\nanyone can extract information from the database. The manual also gives\nphone numbers to call for support in using the system. You may have\nsimilar manuals in your company offering product codes or codes for\nretrieving sensitive information.\nThe FBI almost certainly has never discovered that their sensitive manual\nand procedural instructions are available to anyone on line, and I don’t\nthink they’d be very happy about it if they knew. One copy was posted by\na government department in Oregon, the other by a law enforcement\nagency in Texas. Why? In each case, somebody probably thought the\ninformation was of no value and posting it couldn’t do any harm. Maybe\nsomebody posted it on their intranet just as a convenience to their own\nemployees, never realizing that it made the information available to\neveryone on the Internet who has access to a good search engine such as\nGoogle - including the just-plain-curious, the wannabe cop, the hacker,\nand the organized crime boss.\nTapping into the System\nThe principle of using such information to dupe someone in the\ngovernment or a business setting is the same: Because a social engineer\nknows how to access specific databases or applications, or knows the\nnames of a company’s computer servers, or the like, he gains credibility.\nCredibility leads to trust.\nOnce a social engineer has such codes, getting the information he needs\nis an easy process. In this example, he might begin by calling a clerk in a\nlocal state police Teletype office, and asking a question about one of the\ncodes in the manual - for example, the offense code. He might say\nsomething like, \"When I do an OFF inquiry in the NCIC, I’m getting a\n\"System is down’ error. Are you getting the same thing when you do an\nOFF? Would you try it for me?\" Or maybe he’d say he was trying to look\nup a wpf - police talk for a wanted person’s file.\nThe Teletype clerk on the other end of the phone would pick up the cue\nthat the caller was familiar with the operating procedures and the\ncommands to query the NCIC database. Who else other than someone\ntrained in using NCIC would know these procedures?\nAfter the clerk has confirmed that her system is working okay, the\nconversation\nmight go something like this:\n\"I could use a little help.\" \"What’re you looking for?\"\n\"I need you to do an OFF command on Reardon, Martin. DOB\n10118/66.\"\n\"What’s the sosh?\" (Law enforcement people sometimes refer to the\nsocial security number as the sosh.)\n\"700-14-7435.\"\nAfter looking for the listing, she might come back with something like,\n\"He’s got a 2602.\"\nThe attacker would only have to look at the NCIC on line to find the\nmeaning of the number: The man has a case of swindling on his record.\nAnalyzing the Con\nAn accomplished social engineer wouldn’t stop for a minute to ponder\nways of breaking into the NCIC database. Why should he, when a simple\ncall to his local police department, and some smooth talking so he sounds\nconvincingly like an insider, is all it takes to get the information he wants?\nAnd the next time, he just calls a different police agency and uses the\nsame pretext.\n\nLINGO\nSOSH: Law enforcement slang for a social security number\nYou might wonder, isn’t it risky to call a police department, a sheriff’s\nstation, or a highway patrol office? Doesn’t the attacker run a huge risk?\nThe answer is no . . . and for a specific reason. People in law enforcement,\nlike people in the military, have ingrained in them from the first day in the\nacademy a respect for rank. As long as the social engineer is posing as a\nsergeant or lieutenant--a higher rank than the person he’s talking to - the\nvictim will be governed by that well-learned lesson that says you don’t\nquestion people who are in a position of authority over you. Rank, in\nother words, has its privileges, in particular the privilege of not being\nchallenged by people of lower rank.\nBut don’t think law enforcement and the military are the only places\nwhere this respect for rank can be exploited by the social engineer. Social\nengineers often use authority or rank in the corporate hierarchy as a\nweapon in their attacks on businesses - as a number of the stories in these\npages demonstrate.\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nWhat are some steps your organization can take to reduce the likelihood\nthat social engineers will take advantage of your employees’ natural\ninstinct to trust people? Here are some suggestions.\nProtect Your Customers\nIn this electronic age many companies that sell to the consumer keep\ncredit cards on file. There are reasons for this: It saves the customer the\nnuisance of having to provide the credit card information each time he\nvisits the store or the Web site to make a purchase. However, the practice\nshould be discouraged.\nIf you must keep credit card numbers on file, that process needs to be\naccompanied by security provisions that go beyond encryption or using\naccess control. Employees need to be trained to recognize social\nengineering scams like the ones in this chapter. That fellow employee\nyou’ve never met in person but who has become a telephone friend may\nnot be who he or she claims to be. He may not have the \"need to know\" to\naccess sensitive customer information, because he may not actually work\nfor the company at all.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nEveryone should be aware of the social engineer’s modus operandi:\nGather as much information about the target as possible, and use that\ninformation to gain trust as an insider. Then go for the jugular!\nTrust Wisely\nIt’s not just the people who have access to clearly sensitive information -\nthe software engineers, the folks in R&D, and so on - who need to be on\nthe defensive against intrusions. Almost everyone in your organization\nneeds training to protect the enterprise from industrial spies and\ninformation thieves.\nLaying the groundwork for this should begin with a survey of enterprise-\nwide information assets, looking separately at each sensitive, critical, or\nvaluable asset, and asking what methods an attacker might use to\ncompromise those assets through the use of social engineering tactics.\nAppropriate training for people who have trusted access to such\ninformation should be designed around the answers to these questions.\nWhen anyone you don’t know personally requests some information or\nmaterial, or asks you to perform any task on your computer, have your\nemployees ask themselves some. questions. If I gave this information to\nmy worst enemy, could it be used to injure me or my company? Do I\ncompletely understand the potential effect of the commands I am being\nasked to enter into my computer?\nWe don’t want to go through life being suspicious of every new person we\nencounter. Yet the more trusting we are, the more likely that the next\nsocial engineer to arrive in town will be able to deceive us into giving up\nour company’s proprietary information.\nWhat Belongs on Your Intranet?\nParts of your intranet may be open to the outside world, other parts\nrestricted to employees. How careful is your company in making sure\nsensitive information isn’t posted where it’s accessible to audiences you\nmeant to protect it from? When is the last time anyone in your\norganization checked to see if any sensitive information on your\ncompany’s intranet had inadvertently been made available through the\npublic-access areas of your Web site?\nIf your company has implemented proxy servers as intermediaries to\nprotect the enterprise from electronic security threats, have those servers\nbeen checked recently to be sure they’re configured properly?\nIn fact, has anyone ever checked the security of your intranet?",
    "question": "What is the key concept discussed in the text regarding how social engineers manipulate trust and gain access to sensitive information?",
    "summary": "Social engineering attacks succeed because people are vulnerable to deception through trust. Attackers build trust by mimicking authority figures and using familiar language, making it easier to gain access to sensitive information. To prevent such attacks, organizations should train employees to question requests from unknown individuals and ensure sensitive data is not easily accessible online."

The social engineer understands that, and knows how to take\nadvantage of it.\nHe also knows how to cause a problem for you.., then make you grateful\nwhen he resolves the problem.., and finally play on your gratitude to\nextract some information or a small favor from you that will leave your\ncompany (or maybe you, individually) very much worse off for the\nencounter. And you may never even know you’ve lost something of value.\nHere are some typical ways that social engineers step forward to \"help.\"\n\nTHE NETWORK OUTAGE\nDay/Time: Monday, February 12, 3:25 p.m.\nPlace: Offices of Starboard Shipbuilding\nThe First Call: Tom Delay\n\"Tom DeLay, Bookkeeping.\"\n\"Hey, Tom, this is Eddie Martin from the Help Desk. We’re trying to\ntroubleshoot a computer networking problem. Do you know if anyone in\nyour group has been having trouble staying on line?\"\n\"Uh, not that I know of.\"\n\"And you’re not having any problems yourself.\"\n\"No, seems fine.\"\n\"Okay, that’s good. Listen, we’re calling people who might be affected\n’cause itLs important you let us know right away if you lose your network\nconnection.\"\n\"That doesn’t sound good. You think it might happen?\"\n\"We hope not, but you’ll call if it does, right?\"\n\"You better believe it.\"\n\"Listen, sounds like having your network connection go down would be a\nproblem for you...\"\n\"You bet it would.\"\n\"... so while we’re working on this, let me give you my cell phone\nnumber. Then you can reach me directly if you need to.\"\n\"That’d be great. Go ahead.\"\n\"It’s 555 867 5309.\"\n\"555 867 5309. Got it. Hey, thanks. What was your name again?\"\n\"It’s Eddie. Listen, one other thing--I need to check which port your\ncomputer is connected to. Take a look on your computer and see if there’s\na sticker somewhere that says something like ’Port Number’.\"\n\"Hang on No, don’t see anything like that.\"\n\"Okay, then in the back of the computer, can you recognize the network\ncable.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Trace it back to where it’s plugged in. See if there’s a label on the jack it’s\nplugged into.\"\n\"Hold on a second. Yeah, wait a minute - I have to squat down here so I\ncan get close enough to read it. Okay - it says Port 6 dash 47.\"\n\"Good - that’s what we had you down as, just making sure.\"\nThe Second Call: The IT Guy\nTwo days later, a call came through to the same company’s Network\nOperations Center.\n\"Hi, this is Bob; I’m in Tom DeLay’s office in Bookkeeping. We’re trying\nto troubleshoot a cabling problem. I need you to disable Port 6-47.\"\nThe IT guy said it would be done in just a few minutes, and to let them\nknow when he was ready to have it enabled.\nThe Third Call: Getting Help from the Enemy\nAbout an hour later, the guy who called himself Eddie Martin was\nshopping at Circuit City when his cell phone rang. He checked the caller\nID, saw the call was from the shipbuilding company, and hurried to a\nquiet spot before answering.\n\"Help Desk, Eddie.\"\n\"Oh, hey, Eddie. You’ve got an echo, where are you?\"\n\"I’m, uh, in a cabling closet. Who’s this?\n\"It’s Tom DeLay. Boy, am I glad I got ahold of you. Maybe you\nremember you called me the other day? My network connection just went\ndown like you said it might, and I’m a little panicky here.\"\n\"Yeah, we’ve got a bunch of people down right now. We should have it\ntaken care of by the end of the day. That okay?\"\n\"NO! Damn, I’ll get way behind if I’m down that long. What’s the best you\ncan do for me?\"\n\"How pressed are you?\"\n\"I could do some other things for right now. Any chance you could take\ncare of it in half an hour?\"\n\"HALF AN HOUR! You don’t want much. Well, look, I’ll drop what I’m\ndoing and see if I can tackle it for you.\"\n\"Hey, I really appreciate that, Eddie.\"\nThe Fourth Call: Gotcha!\nForty-five minutes later...\n\"Tom? It’s Eddie. Go ahead and try your network connection.\"\nAfter a couple of moments:\n\"Oh, good, it’s working. That’s just great.\"\n\"Good, glad I could take care of it for you.\"\n\"Yeah, thanks a lot.\"\n\"Listen, if you want to make sure your connection doesn’t go down again,\nthere’s some software you oughta be running. Just take a couple of\nminutes.\"\n\"Now’s not the best time.\"\n\"I understand... It could save us both big headaches the next time this\nnetwork problem happens.\"\n\"Well . . . if it’s only a few minutes.\"\n\"Here’s what you do...\"\nEddie then took Tom through the steps of downloading a small\napplication from a Web site. After the program had downloaded, Eddie\ntold Tom to double-click on it. He tried, but reported:\n\"It’s not working. It’s not doing anything.\"\n\"Oh, what a pain. Something must be wrong with the program. Let’s just\nget rid of it, we can try again another time.\" And he talked Tom through\nthe steps of deleting the program so it couldn’t be recovered.\nTotal elapsed time, twelve minutes.\nThe Attacker’s Story\nBobby Wallace always thought it was laughable when he picked up a\ngood assignment like this one and his client pussyfooted around the\nunasked but obvious question of why they wanted the information. In this\ncase he could only think of two reasons. Maybe they represented some\noutfit that was interested in buying the target company, Starboard\nShipbuilding, and wanted to know what kind of financial shape they were\nreally in - especially all the stuff the target might want to keep hidden\nfrom a potential buyer. Or maybe they represented investors who thought\nthere was something fishy about the way the money was being handled\nand wanted to find out whether some of the executives had a case of\nhands-in-the cookie-jar.\nAnd maybe his client also didn’t want to tell him the real reason because,\nif Bobby knew how valuable the information was, he’d probably want\nmore money for doing the job.\nThere are a lot of ways to crack into a company’s most secret files. Bobby\nspent a few days mulling over the choices and doing a little checking\naround before he decided on a plan. He settled on one that called for an\napproach he especially liked, where the target is set up so that he asks the\nattacker for help.\nFor starters, Bobby picked up a $39.95 cell phone at a convenience store.\nHe placed a call to the man he had chosen as his target, passed himself off\nas being from the company help desk, and set things up so the man would\ncall Bobby’s cell phone any time he found a problem with his network\nconnection.\nHe left a pause of two days so as not to be too obvious, and then made a\ncall to the network operations center (NOC) at the company. He claimed\nhe was trouble-shooting a problem for Tom, the target, and asked to have\nTom’s network connection disabled. Bobby knew this was the trickiest\npart of the whole escapade - in many companies, the help desk people\nwork closely with the NOC; in fact, he knew the help desk is often part of\nthe IT organization. But the indifferent NOC guy he spoke with treated\nthe call as routine, didn’t ask for the name of the help desk person who\nwas supposedly working on the networking problem, and agreed to\ndisable the target’s network port. When done, Tom would be totally\nisolated from the company’s intranet, unable to retrieve files from the\nserver, exchange files with his co-workers, download his email, or even\nsend a page of data to the printer. In today’s world, that’s like living in a\ncave.\nAs Bobby expected, it wasn’t long before his cell phone rang. Of course\nhe made himself sound eager to help this poor \"fellow employee\" in\ndistress. Then he called the NOC and had the man’s network connection\nturned back on. Finally, he called the man and manipulated him once\nagain, this time making him feel guilty for saying no after Bobby had\ndone him a favor. Tom agreed to the request that he download a piece of\nsoftware to his computer.\nOf course, what he agreed to wasn’t exactly what it seemed. The software\nthat Tom was told would keep his network connection from going down,\nwas really a Trojan Horse, a software application that did for Tom’s\ncomputer what the original deception did for the Trojans: It brought the\nenemy inside the camp. Tom reported that nothing happened when he\ndouble-clicked on the software icon; the fact was that, by design, he\ncouldn’t see anything happening, even though the small application was\ninstalling a secret program that would allow the infiltrator covert access to\nTom’s computer.\nWith the software running, Bobby was provided with complete control\nover Tom’s computer, an arrangement known as a remote command shell.\nWhen Bobby accessed Tom’s computer, he could look for the accounting\nfiles that might be of interest and copy them. Then, at his leisure, he’d\nexamine them for the information that would give his clients what they\nwere looking for.\n\nLINGO\nTROJAN HORSE: A program containing malicious or harmful code,\ndesigned to damage the victim’s computer or files, or obtain information\nfrom the victim’s computer or network. Some Trojans are designed to hide\nwithin the computer’s operating system and spy on every keystroke or\naction, or accept instruction over a network connection to perform some\nfunction, all without the victim being aware of its presence.\nAnd that wasn’t all. He could go back at any time to search through the\nemail messages and private memos of the company’s executives, running\na text search for words that might reveal any interesting tidbits of\ninformation.\nLate on the night that he conned his target into installing the Trojan Horse\nsoftware, Bobby threw the cell phone into a Dumpster. Of course he was\ncareful to clear the memory first and pull the battery out before he tossed\nit - the last thing he wanted was for somebody to call the cell phone’s\nnumber by mistake and have the phone start ringing!\nAnalyzing the Con\nThe attacker spins a web to convince the target he has a problem that, in\nfact, doesn’t really exist - or, as in this case, a problem that hasn’t\nhappened yet, but that the attacker knows will happen because he’s going\nto cause it. He then presents himself as the person who can provide the\nsolution.\nThe setup in this kind of attack is particularly juicy for the attacker:\nBecause of the seed planted in advance, when the target discovers he has\na problem, he himself makes the phone call to plead for help. The attacker\njust sits and waits for the phone to ring, a tactic fondly known in the trade\nas reverse social engineering. An attacker who can make the target call\nhim\ngains instant credibility: If I place a call to someone I think is on the help\ndesk,\nI’m not going to start asking him to prove his identity. That’s when the\nattacker has it made.\n\nLINGO\nREMOTE COMMAND SHELL: A non graphical interface that accepts\ntext based commands to perform certain functions or run programs. An\nattacker who exploits technical vulnerabilities or is able to install a Trojan\nHorse program on the victims computer may be able to obtain remote\naccess to a command shell\nREVERSE SOCIAL ENGINEERING: A social\nengineering attack in which the attacker sets up a\nsituation where the victim encounters a problem and\ncontacts the attacker for help. Another form of reverse\nsocial engineering turns the tables on the attacker. The\ntarget recognizes the attack, and uses psychological\nprinciples of influence to draw out as much information\nas possible from the attacker so that the business can\nsafeguard targeted assets.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nIf a stranger does you a favor, then asks you for a favor,\ndon’t reciprocate without thinking carefully about what\nhe’s asking for.\nIn a con like this one, the social engineer tries to pick a target who is\nlikely to have limited knowledge of computers. The more he knows, the\nmore likely that he’ll get suspicious, or just plain figure out that he’s being\nmanipulated. What I sometimes call the computer-challenged worker,\nwho is less knowledgeable about technology and procedures, is more\nlikely to comply. He’s all the more likely to fall for a ruse like \"Just\ndownload this little program,\" because he has no idea of the potential\ndamage a software program can inflict. What’s more, there’s a much\nsmaller chance he’ll understand the value of the information on the\ncomputer network that he’s placing at risk.\n\nA LITTLE HELP FOR THE NEW GAL\nNew employees are a ripe target for attackers. They don’t know many\npeople yet, they don’t know the procedures or the dos and don’ts of the\ncompany. And, in the name of making a good first impression, they’re\neager show how cooperative and quick to respond they can be.\nHelpful Andrea\n\"Human Resources, Andrea Calhoun.\"\n\"Andrea, hi, this is Alex, with Corporate Security.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"How’re you doing today?\"\n\"Okay. What can I help you with?\"\n\"Listen, we’re developing a security seminar for new employees and we\nneed to round up some people to try it out on. I want to get the name and\nphone number of all the new hires in the past month. Can you help me\nwith that?\"\n\"I won’t be able to get to it ’til this afternoon. Is that okay?\n\"What’s your extension?\"\n\"Sure, okay, it’s 52 . . . oh, uh, but I’ll be in meetings most of today. I’ll\ncall you when I’m back in my office, probably after four.\"\nWhen Alex called about 4:30, Andrea had the list ready, and read him the\nnames and extensions.\nA Message for Rosemary\nRosemary Morgan was delighted with her new job. She had never worked\nfor a magazine before and was finding the people much friendlier than she\nexpected, a surprise because of the never-ending pressure most of the staff\nwas always under to get yet another issue finished by the monthly\ndeadline. The call she received one Thursday morning reconfirmed that\nimpression of friendliness.\n\"Is that Rosemary Morgan?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Hi, Rosemary. This is Bill Jorday, with the Information Security\ngroup.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Has anyone from our department discussed best security practices with\nyou?\"\n\"I don’t think so.\"\n\"Well, let’s see. For starters, we don’t allow anybody to install software\nbrought in from outside the company. That’s because we don’t want any\nliability for unlicensed use of software. And to avoid any problems with\nsoftware that might have a worm or a virus.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Are you aware of our email policies?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"What’s your current email address?\" \"Rosemary@ttrzine.net.\"\n\"Do you sign in under the username Rosemary?\"\n\"No, it’s R underscore Morgan.\"\n\"Right. We like to make all our new employees aware that it can be\ndangerous to open any email attachment you aren’t expecting. Lots of\nviruses and worms get sent around and they come in emails that seem to\nbe from people you know. So if you get an email with an attachment you\nweren’t expecting you should always check to be sure the person listed as\nsender really did send you the message. You understand?\"\n\"Yes, I’ve heard about that.\"\n\"Good. And our policy is that you change your password every ninety\ndays. When did you last change your password?\"\n\"I’ve only been here three weeks; I’m still using the one I first set.\"\n\"Okay, that’s fine. You can wait the rest of the ninety days. But we need\nto be sure people are using passwords that aren’t too easy to guess. Are\nyou using a password that consists of both letters and numbers?\"\n\"No.\"\nWe need to fix that. What password are you using now?\"\n\"It’s my daughter’s name - Annette.\"\n\"That’s really not a secure password. You should never choose a password\nthat’s based on family information. Well, let’s see.., you could do the same\nthing I do. It’s okay to use what you’re using now as the first part of the\npassword, but then each time you change it, add a number for the current\nmonth.\"\n\"So if I did that now, for March, would I use three, or oh-three.\"\n\"That’s up to you. Which would you be more comfortable with?\"\n\"I guess Annette-three.\"\n\"Fine. Do you want me to walk you through how to make the change?\"\n\"No, I know how.\"\n\"Good. And one more thing we need to talk about. You have anti-virus\nsoftware on your computer and it’s important to keep it up to date. You\nshould never disable the automatic update even if your computer slows\ndown every once in a while. Okay?\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"Very good. And do you have our phone number over here,\nso you can call us if you have any computer problems?\"\nShe didn’t. He gave her the number, she wrote it down carefully, and went\nback to work, once again, pleased at how well taken care of she felt.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThis story reinforces an underlying theme you’ll find throughout this\nbook: The most common information that a social engineer wants from an\nemployee, regardless of his ultimate goal, is the target’s authentication\ncredentials. With an account name and password in hand from a single\nemployee in the right area of the company, the attacker has what he needs\nto get inside and locate whatever information he’s after. Having this\ninformation is like finding the keys to the kingdom; with them in hand, he\ncan move freely around the corporate landscape and find the treasure he\nseeks.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nBefore new employees are allowed access to any company\ncomputer systems, they must be trained to follow good security\npractices, especially policies about never disclosing their\npasswords.\n\nNOT AS SAFE AS YOU THINK\n\"The company that doesn’t make an effort to protect its sensitive\ninformation is just plain negligent.\" A lot of people would agree with that\nstatement. And the world would be a better place if life were so obvious\nand so simple. The truth is that even those companies that do make an\neffort to protect confidential information may be at serious risk. Here’s a story that illustrates once again how companies fool themselves\nevery day into thinking their security practices, designed by experienced,\ncompetent, professionals, cannot be circumvented. Steve Cramer’s Story\nIt wasn’t a big lawn, not one of those expensively seeded spreads. It\ngarnered no envy. And it certainly wasn’t big enough to give him an\nexcuse for buying a sit-down mower, which was fine because he wouldn’t\nhave used one anyway. Steve enjoyed cutting the grass with a hand-\nmower because it took longer, and the chore provided a convenient excuse\nto focus on his own thoughts instead of listening to Anna telling him\nstories about the people at the bank where she worked or explaining\nerrands for him to do. He hated those honey-do lists that had become an\nintegral part of his weekends. It flashed though his mind that 12-year-old\nPete was damn smart to join the swimming team. Now he’d have to be at\npractice or a meet every Saturday so he wouldn’t get stuck with Saturday\nchores. Some people might think Steve’s job designing new devices for\nGeminiMed Medical Products was boring; Steve knew he was saving\nlives. Steve thought of himself as being in a creative line of work. Artist,\nmusic composer, engineer - in Steve’s view they all faced the same kind\nof challenge he did: They created something that no one had ever done\nbefore. And his latest, an intriguingly clever new type of heart stent,\nwould be his proudest achievement yet. It was almost 11:30 on this particular Saturday, and Steve was annoyed\nbecause he had almost finished cutting the grass and hadn’t made any real\nprogress in figuring out how to reduce the power requirement on the heart\nstent, the last remaining hurdle. A perfect problem to mull over while\nmowing, but no solution had come. Anna appeared at the door, her hair covered in the red paisley cowboy\nscarf she always wore when dusting. \"Phone call,\" she shouted to him. \"Somebody from work.\"\n\"Who?\" Steve shouted back. \"Ralph something. I think.\"\nRalph? Steve couldn’t remember anybody at GeminiMed named Ralph\nwho might be calling on a weekend. But Anna probably had the name\nwrong. \"Steve, this is Ramon Perez in Tech Support.\" Ramon - how in the world\ndid Anna get from a Hispanic name to Ralph, Steve wondered. \"This is just a courtesy call,, Ramon was saying. \"Three of the servers\nare down, we think maybe a worm, and we have to wipe the drives and\nrestore from backup. We should be able to have your files up and running\nby Wednesday or Thursday. If we’re lucky.\"\n\"Absolutely unacceptable,\" Steve said firmly, trying not to let his\nfrustration take over. How could these people be so stupid? Did they\nreally think he could manage without access to his files all weekend and\nmost of next week? \"No way. I’m going to sit down at my home terminal\nin just about two hours and I will need access to my files. Am I making\nthis clear?\"\n\"Yeah, well, everybody I’ve called so far wants to be at the top of the list. I gave up my weekend to come in and work on this and it’s no fun having\neverybody I talk to get pissed at me.\"\n\"I’m on a tight deadline, the company is counting on this; I’ve got to get\nwork done this afternoon. What part of this do you not understand?\"\n\"I’ve still got a lot of people to call before I can even get started,\" Ramon\nlaid. \"How about we say you’ll have your files by Tuesday?\"\n\"Not Tuesday, not Monday, today. NOW!\" Steve said, wondering who he\nwas going to call if he couldn’t get his point through this guy’s thick skull. \"Okay, okay,\" Ramon said, and Steve could hear him breathe a sigh of\nannoyance. \"Let me see what I can do to get you going. You use the\nRM22 server, right?\"\n\"RM22 and the GM16. Both.\"\n\"Right. Okay, I can cut some corners, save some time--I’ll need your\nusername and password.\"\nUh oh, Steve thought. What’s going on here? Why would he need my pass\nword? Why would IT, of all people, ask for it? \"What did you say your last name was? And who’s your supervisor?\"\n\"Ramon Perez. Look, I tell you what, when you were hired, there was a\nform you had to fill out to get your user account, and you had to put\ndown a password. I could look that up and show you we’ve got it on file\nhere. Okay?\"\nSteve mulled that over for a few moments, then agreed. He hung on\nwith growing impatience while Ramon went to retrieve documents from\na file cabinet. Finally back on the phone, Steve could hear him shuffling\nthrough a stack of papers. \"Ah, here it is,\" Ramon said at last. \"You put down the password\n’Janice.’\"\nJanice, Steve thought. It was his mother’s name, and he had indeed\nsometimes used it as a password. He might very well have put that down\nfor his password when filling out his new-hire papers. \"Yes, that’s right,\" he acknowledged. \"Okay, we’re wasting time here. You know I’m for real, you want me to\nuse the shortcut and get your files back in a hurry, you re gonna have to\nhelp me out here.\"\n\"My ID is s, d, underscore, cramer--c-r-a-m-e-r. The password is ’pelican\n1 .’\"\n\"I’ll get right on it,\" Ramon said, sounding helpful at last. \"Give me a\ncouple of hours.\"\nSteve finished the lawn, had lunch, and by the time he got to his\ncomputer found that his files had indeed been restored. He was pleased\nwith himself for handling that uncooperative IT guy so forcefully, and\nhoped Anna had heard how assertive he was. Would be good to give the\nguy or\nhis boss an attaboy, but he knew it was one of those things he’d never get\naround to doing. Craig Cogburne’s Story\nCraig Cogburne had been a salesman for a high-tech company, and done\nwell at it. After a time he began to realize he had a skill for reading a\ncustomer, understanding where the person was resistant and recognizing\nsome weakness or vulnerability that made it easy to close the sale. He\nbegan to think about other ways to use this talent, and the path eventually\nled him into a far more lucrative field: corporate espionage. This one was a hot assignment. Didn’t look to take me very long and\nworth enough to pay for a trip to Hawaii. Or maybe Tahiti. The guy that hired me, he didn’t tell me the client, of course, but it figured\nto be some company that wanted to catch up with the competition in one\nquick, big, easy leap. All I’d have to do is get the designs and product\nspecs for a new gadget called a heart stent, whatever that was. The\ncompany was called GeminiMed. Never heard of it, but it was a Fortune\n500 outfit with offices in half a dozen locations - which makes the job\neasier than a smaller company where there’s a fair chance the guy you’re\ntalking to knows the guy you’re claiming to be and knows you’re not him. This, like pilots say about a midair collision, can ruin your whole day. My client sent me a fax, a bit from some doctor’s magazine that said\nGeminiMed was working on a stent with a radical new design and it\nwould be called the STH-IO0. For crying out loud, some reporter has\nalready done a big piece of the legwork for me. I had one thing I needed\neven before I got started, the new product name. First problem: Get names of people in the company who worked on the\nSTH-100 or might need to see the designs. So I called the switchboard\noperator and said, \"I promised one of the people in your engineering\ngroup I’d get in touch with him and I don’t remember his last name, but\nhis first name started with an S.\" And she said, \"We have a Scott Archer\nand a Sam Davidson.\" I took a long shot. \"Which one works in the\nSTH100 group?\" She didn’t know, so I just picked Scott Archer at\nrandom, and she rang his phone. When he answered, I said, \"Hey, this is Mike, in the mail room. We’ve got\na FedEx here that’s for the Heart Stent STH-100 project team. Any idea\nwho that should go to?\" He gave me the name of the project leader, Jerry\nMendel. I even got him to look up the phone number for me. I called. Mendel wasn’t there but his voice mail message said he’d be on\nvacation till the thirteenth, which meant he had another week left for\nskiing or whatever, and anybody who needed something in the meantime\nshould call Michelle on 9137. Very helpful, these people. Very helpful. I hung up and called Michelle, got her on the phone and said, \"This is Bill\nThomas. Jerry told me I should call you when I had the spec ready\nthat he wanted the guys on his team to review. You’re working on the\nheart stent, right?\" She said they were. Now we were getting to the sweaty part of the scam. If she started\nsounding suspicious, I was ready to play the card about how I was just\ntrying to\ndo a favor Jerry had asked me for. I said, \"Which system are you on?\"\n\"System?\"\n\"Which computer servers does your group use?\"\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"RM22. And some of the group also use GM16.\" Good. I\nneeded that, and it was a piece of information I could get from her without\nmaking her suspicious. Which softened her up for the next bit, done as\ncasually as I could manage. \"Jerry said you could give me a list of email\naddresses for people on the development team,\" I said, and held my\nbreath. \"Sure. The distribution list is too long to read off, can I email it to you?\"\nOops. Any email address that didn’t end in GeminiMed.com would be\na huge red flag. \"How about you fax it to me?\" I said. She had no problem with doing that. \"Our fax machine is on the blink. I’ll have to get the number of another\none. Call you back in a bit,\" I said, and hung up. Now, you might think I was saddled with a sticky problem here, but it’s\njust another routine trick of the trade. I waited a while so my voice\nwouldn’t sound familiar to the receptionist, then called her and said, \"Hi,\nit’s Bill Thomas, our fax machine isn’t working up here, can I have a fax\nsent to your machine?\" She said sure, and gave me the number. Then I just walk in and pick up the fax, right? Of course not. First rule:\nNever visit the premises unless you absolutely have to. They have a hard\ntime identifying you if you’re just a voice on the telephone. And if they\ncan’t identify you, they can’t arrest you. It’s hard to put handcuffs around a\nvoice. So I called the receptionist back after a little while and asked her,\ndid my fax come? \"Yes,\" she said. \"Look,\" I told her, \"I’ve got to get that to a consultant we’re using. Could\nyou send it out for me?\" She agreed. And why not--how could any\nreceptionist be expected to recognize sensitive data? While she sent the\nfax out to the \"consultant,\" I had my exercise for the day walking over to\na stationery store near me, the one with the sign out front \"Faxes\nSent/Rcvd.\" My fax was supposed to arrive before I did, and as expected,\nit was there waiting for me when I walked in. Six pages at $1.75. For a\n$10 bill and change, I had the group’s entire list of names and email\naddresses. Getting Inside\nOkay, so I had by now talked to three or four different people in only a\nfew hours and was already one giant step closer to getting inside the\ncompany’s computers. But I’d need a couple more pieces before I was\nhome. Number one was the phone number for dialing into the Engineering server\nfrom outside. I called GeminiMed again and asked the switchboard\noperator for the IT Department, and asked the guy who answered for\nsomebody who could give me some computer help. He transferred me,\nand I put on an act of being confused and kind of stupid about anything\ntechnical. \"I’m at home, just bought a new laptop, and I need to set it up o\nI can dial in from outside.\"\nThe procedure was obvious but I patiently let him talk me through it until\nhe got to the dial-in phone number. He gave me the number like it was\njust another routine piece of information. Then I made him wait while I\ntried it. Perfect. So now I had passed the hurdle of connecting to the network. I dialed in\nand found they were set up with a terminal server that would let a caller\nconnect to any computer on their internal network.\n\nAfter a bunch of tries\nI stumbled across somebody’s computer that had a guest account with no\npassword required. Some operating systems, when first installed, direct\nthe user to set up an ID and password, but also provide a guest account. The user is supposed to set his or her own password for the guest account\nor disable it, but most people don’t know about this, or just don’t bother. This system was probably just set up and the owner hadn’t bothered to\ndisable the guest account.\n\nLINGO\nPASSWOPRD HASH: A string of gibberish that results from processing a password\nthrough a one way encryption process. The process is supposedly irreversible; that is,\nits believed that it is not possible to reconstruct the password from the hash\nThanks to the guest account, I now had access to one computer, which\nturned out to be running an older version of the UNIX operating system.\nUnder UNIX, the operating system maintains a password file which con-\nrains the encrypted passwords of everybody authorized to access that\ncomputer. The password file contains the one-way hash (that is, a form of\nencryption that is irreversible) of every user’s password. With a one-way\nhash an actual password such as, say, \"justdoit\" would be represented by a\nhash in encrypted form; in this case the hash would be converted by\nUNIX to thirteen alphanumeric characters.\nWhen Billy Bob down the hall wants to transfer some files to a computer,\nhe’s required to identify himself by providing a username and password.\nThe system program that\" checks his authorization encrypts the password\nhe enters, and then compares the result to the encrypted password (the\nhash) contained in the password file; if the two match, he’s given access.\nBecause the passwords in the file were encrypted, the file itself was made\navailable to any user on the theory that there’s no known way to decrypt\nthe passwords. That’s a laugh - I downloaded the file, ran a dictionary\nattack on it (see Chapter 12 for more about this method) and found that\none of the engineers on the development team, a guy named Steven\nCramer, currently had an account on the computer with the password\n\"Janice.\" Just on the chance, I tried entering his account with that\npassword on one of the development servers; if it had worked, it would\nhave saved me some time and a little risk. It didn’t.\nThat meant I’d have to trick the guy into telling me his username and\npassword. For that, I’d wait until the weekend. 70 You already know the\nrest. On Saturday I called Cramer and walked him through a ruse about a\nworm and the servers having to be restored from backup to overcome his\nsuspicions.\nWhat about the story I told him, the one about listing a password when he\nfilled out his employee papers? I was counting on him not remembering\nthat had never happened. A new employee fills out so many forms that,\nyears later, who would remember? And anyway, if I had struck out with\nhim, I still had that long list of other names.\nWith his username and password, I got into the server, fished around for a\nlittle while, and then located the design files for the STH-100. I wasn’t\nexactly sure which ones were key, so I just transferred all the files to a\ndead drop, a free FTP site in China, where they could be stored without\nanybody getting suspicious. Let the client sort through the junk and find\nwhat he wants.\n\nLINGO\nDEAD DROP A place for leaving information where it is unlikely to be\nfound by others. In the world of traditional spies, this might be behind a\nloose stone in a wall; in the world of the computer hacker, it’s commonly\nan Internet site in a remote country.\nAnalyzing the Con\nFor the man we’re calling Craig Cogburne, or anyone like him equally\nskilled in the larcenous-but-not-always-illegal arts of social engineering,\nthe challenge presented here was almost routine. His goal was to locate\nand download files stored on a secure corporate computer, protected by a\nfirewall and all the usual security technologies.\nMost of his work was as easy as catching rainwater in a barrel. He began\nby posing as somebody from the mail room and furnished an added sense\nof urgency by claiming there was a FedEx package waiting to be\ndelivered. This deception produced the name of the team leader for the\nheart-stent engineering group, who was on vacation, but - convenient for\nany social engineer trying to steal information - he had helpfully left the\nname and phone number of his assistant. Calling her, Craig defused any\nsuspicions by claiming that he was responding to a request from the team\nleader. With the team leader out of town, Michelle had no way to verify\nhis claim. She accepted it as the truth and had no problem providing a list\nof people in the group - for Craig, a necessary and highly prized set of\ninformation.\nShe didn’t even get suspicious when Craig wanted the list sent by fax\ninstead of by email, ordinarily more convenient on both ends. Why was\nshe so gullible? Like many employees, she didn’t want her boss to return\nto town and find she had stonewalled a caller who was just trying to do\nsomething the boss had asked him for. Besides, the caller said that the\nboss had not just authorized the request, but asked for his assistance. Once\nagain, here’s an example of someone displaying the strong desire to be a\nteam player, which makes most people susceptible to deception.\nCraig avoided the risk of physically entering the building simply by\nhaving the fax sent to the receptionist, knowing she was likely to be\nhelpful. Receptionists are, after all, usually chosen for their charming\npersonalities and their ability to make a good impression. Doing small\nfavors like receiving a fax and sending it on comes with the receptionist’s\nterritory, a fact that Craig was able to take advantage of. What she was\nending out happened to be information that might have raised alarm bells\nwith anyone knowing the value of the information - but how could\nreceptionist be expected to know which information is benign and which\nsensitive?\nUsing a different style of manipulation, Craig acted confused and naive\nto convince the guy in computer operations to provide him with the dial\nup access number to the company’s terminal server, the hardware used as\na connection point to other computer systems within the internal network.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nEverybody’s first priority at work is to get the job done. Under that\npressure, security practices often take second place and are overlooked or\nignored. Social engineers rely on this when practicing their craft.\nCraig was able to connect easily by trying a default password that had\nnever been changed, one of the glaring, wide-open gaps that exist\nthroughout many internal networks that rely on firewall security. In fact,\nthe default passwords for many operating systems, routers, and other\ntypes\nof products, including PBXs, are made available on line. Any social\nengineer, hacker, or industrial spy, as well as the just plain curious, can\nfind the list at http://www.phenoelit.de/dpl/dpl.html. (It’s absolutely\nincredible\nhow easy the Internet makes life for those who know where to look. And\nnow you know, too.)\nCogburne then actually managed to convince a cautious, suspicious\nman (\"What did you say your last name was? Who’s your supervisor?\")\nto\ndivulge his username and password so that he could access servers used\nby\nthe heart-stent development team. This was like leaving Craig with an\nopen door to browse the company’s most closely guarded secrets and\ndownload the plans for the new product.\nWhat if Steve Cramer had continued to be suspicious about Craig’s call?\nIt was unlikely he would do anything about reporting his suspicions until\nhe showed up at work on Monday morning, which would have been too\nlate to prevent the attack.\nOne key to the last part of the ruse: Craig at first made himself sound\nlackadaisical and uninterested in Steve’s concerns, then changed his tune\nand sounded as if he was trying to help so Steve could get his work done.\nMost of the time, if the victim believes you’re trying to help him or do\nhim\nsome kind of favor, he will part with confidential information that he\nwould have otherwise protected carefully.\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nOne of the most powerful tricks of the social engineer involves turning the\ntables. That’s what you’ve seen in this chapter. The social engineer creates\nthe problem, and then magically solves the problem, deceiving the victim\ninto providing access to the company’s most guarded secrets. Would your\nemployees fall for this type of ruse? Have you bothered to draft and\ndistribute specific security rules that could help to prevent it?\nEducate, Educate, and Educate...\nThere’s an old story about a visitor to New York who stops a man on the\nstreet and asks, \"How do I get to Carnegie Hall?\" The man answers,\n\"Practice, practice, practice.\" Everyone is so vulnerable to social\nengineering attacks that a company’s only effective defense is to educate\nand train your people, giving them the practice they need to spot a social\nengineer. And then keep reminding people on a consistent basis of what\nthey learned in the training, but are all too apt to forget.\nEveryone in the organization must be trained to exercise an appropriate\ndegree of suspicion and caution when contacted by someone he or she\ndoesn’t personally know, especially when that someone is asking for any\nsort of access to a computer or network. It’s human nature to want to trust\nothers, but as the Japanese say, business is war. Your business cannot\nafford to let down its guard. Corporate security policy must clearly define\nappropriate and inappropriate behavior.\nSecurity is not one-size-fits-all. Business personnel usually have disparate\nroles and responsibilities and each position has associated vulnerabilities.\nThere should be a base level of training that everyone in the company is\nrequired to complete, and then people must also be trained according to\ntheir job profile to adhere to certain procedures that will reduce the chance\nthat they will become part of the problem. People who work with\nsensitive information or are placed in positions of trust should be given\nadditional specialized training.\nKeeping Sensitive Information Safe\nWhen people are approached by a stranger offering to help, as seen in the\nstories in this chapter, they have to fall back on corporate security policy\nthat is tailored as appropriate to the business needs, size, and culture of\nyour company.\n\nNOTE\nPersonally, I don(cid:146)t believe any business should allow any exchange of\npasswords. Its much easier to establish a hard rule that forbids personnel\nfrom ever sharing or exchanging confidential passwords. Its safer, too.\nBut each business has to assess its own culture and security concerns in\nmaking this choice\nNever cooperate with a stranger who asks you to look up information,\nenter unfamiliar commands into a computer, make changes to software\nsettings or - the most potentially disastrous of all - open an email\nattachment\nor download unchecked software. Any software program - even one that\nappears to do nothing at all - may not be as innocent as it appears to be.\nThere are certain procedures that, no matter how good our training, we\ntend to grow careless about over time. Then we forget about that training\nat crunch time, just when we need it. You would think that not giving out\nyour account name and password is something that just about everybody\nknows (or should know) and hardly needs to be told: it’s simple common\nsense. But in fact, every employee needs to be reminded frequently that\ngiving out the account name and password to their office computer, their\nhome computer, or even the postage machine in the mail room is\nequivalent to giving out the PIN number for their ATM card.\nThere is occasionally - very occasionally - a quite valid circumstance\nwhen it’s necessary, perhaps even important, to give someone else\nconfidential information. For that reason, it’s not appropriate to make an\nabsolute rule about \"never.\" Still, your security policies and procedures do\nneed to be very specific about circumstances under which an employee\nmay give out his or her password and - most importantly--who is\nauthorized to ask for the information.\nConsider the Source\nIn most organizations, the rule should be that any information that can\npossibly cause harm to the company or to a. fellow employee may be\ngiven only to someone who is known on a face-to-face basis, or whose\nvoice is so familiar that you recognize it without question.\nIn high-security situations, the only requests that should be granted are\nones delivered in person or with a strong form of authentication--for\nexample, two separate items such as a shared secret and a time-based\ntoken.\nData classification procedures must designate that no information be\nprovided from a part of the organization involved with sensitive work to\nanyone not personally known or vouched for in some manner.\n\nNOTE\nIncredibly, even looking up the name and phone number of the caller in\nthe company’s employee database and calling him back is not an absolute\nguarantee social engineers know ways of planting names in a corporate\ndatabase or redirecting telephone calls.\nSo how do you handle a legitimate-sounding request for information from\nanother company employee, such as the list of names and email addresses\nof people in your group? In fact, how do you raise awareness so that an\nitem like this, which is clearly less valuable than, say, a spec sheet for a\nproduct under development, is recognized as something for internal use\nonly? One major part of the solution: Designate employees in each\ndepartment who will handle all requests for information to be sent outside\nthe group. An advanced security-training program must then be\nprovided to make these designated employees aware of the special\nverification procedures they should follow.\nForget Nobody\nAnyone can quickly rattle off the identity of organizations within her\ncompany that need a high degree of protection against malicious attacks.\nBut we often overlook other places that are less obvious, yet highly\nvulnerable. In one of these stories, the request for a fax to be sent to a\nphone number within the company seemed innocent and secure enough,\nyet the attacker took advantage of this security loophole. The lesson here:\nEverybody from secretaries and administrative assistants to company\nexecutives and high-level managers needs to have special security training\nso that they can be alert to these types of tricks. And don’t forget to guard\nthe front door: Receptionists, too, are often prime targets for social\nengineers and must also be made aware of the deceptive techniques used\nby some visitors and callers.\nCorporate security should establish a single point of contact as a kind of\ncentral clearinghouse for employees who think they may have been the\ntarget of a social engineering ruse. Having a single place to report security\nincidents will provide an effective early-warning system that will make it\ndear when a coordinated attack is under way, so that any damage can be\ncontrolled immediately.",
    "question": "What is the method used by social engineers to manipulate individuals into providing sensitive information or access to company systems?",
    "summary": "This chapter explains how social engineers exploit people's gratitude by first creating a problem and then offering help, often leading to the extraction of sensitive information. It details a scenario where an attacker tricks an employee into providing login credentials by posing as a help desk representative. Another example shows an attacker gaining access to a company's network by using a guest account and default passwords. The text emphasizes the importance of educating employees to recognize and resist social engineering tactics, as well as implementing strict security policies to prevent the unauthorized sharing of passwords and other sensitive data."

We can all sympathize with people in a tight spot, and the approach\nproves effective over and over again in allowing a social engineer to\nreach\nhis goal.\n\nTHE OUT-OF TOWNER\nA story in Chapter 3 showed how an attacker can talk a victim into\nrevealing his employee number. This one uses a different approach for\nachieving the same result, and then shows how the attacker can make use\nof that\nKeeping Up with the Joneses\nIn Silicon Valley there is a certain global company that shall be nameless.\nThe scattered sales offices and other field installations around the world\nare all connected to that company’s headquarters over a WAN, a wide area\nnetwork. The intruder, a smart, feisty guy named Brian Atterby, knew\nit was almost always easier to break into a network at one of the remote\nsites where security is practically guaranteed to be more lax than at\nheadquarters.\nThe intruder phoned the Chicago office and asked to speak with Mr Jones.\nThe receptionist asked if he knew Mr. Jones’s first name; he\nanswered, \"I had it here, I’m looking for it. How many Joneses do you\nhave?\" She said, \"Three. Which department would he be in?\"\nHe said, \"If you read me the names, maybe I’ll recognize it.\" So she did:\n\"Barry, Joseph, and Gordon.\"\n\"Joe. I’m pretty sure that was it,\" he said. \"And he was in . . . which\ndepartment?\"\n\"Business Development.\"\n\"Fine. Can you connect me, please?\"\nShe put the call through. When Jones answered, the attacker said, \"Mr.\nJones? Hi, this is Tony in Payroll. We just put through your request to\nhave your paycheck deposited directly to your credit union account.\"\n\"WHAT???!!! You’ve got to be kidding. I didn’t make any request like\nthat. I don’t even have an account at a credit union.\"\n\"Oh, damn, I already put it through.\"\nJones was more than a little upset at the idea that his paycheck might be\ngoing to someone else’s account, and he was beginning to think the guy\non the other end of the phone must be a little slow. Before he could even\nreply, the attacker said, \"I better see what happened. Payroll changes are\nentered by employee number. What’s your employee number?\"\nJones gave the number. The caller said, \"No, you’re right, the request\nwasn’t from you, then.\" They get more stupid every year, Jones thought.\n\"Look, I’ll see it’s taken care of. I’ll put in a correction right now. So\ndon’t worry - you’ll get your next paycheck okay,\" the guy said\nreassuringly.\nA Business Trip\nNot long after, the system administrator in the company’s Austin, Texas,\nsales office received a phone call. \"This is Joseph Jones,\" the caller\nannounced. \"I’m in Business Development at corporate. I’ll be in to, for\nthe week, at the Driskill Hotel. I’d like to have you set me up with a\ntemporary account so I can access my email without making a long\ndistance call.\"\n\"Let me get that name again, and give me your employee number,\" the\nsys admin said. The false Jones gave the number and went on, \"Do you\nhave any high speed dial-up numbers.\n\"Hold on, buddy. I gotta verify you in the database.\" After a bit, he said,\n\"Okay, Joe. Tell me, what’s your building number?\" The attacker had\ndone his homework and had the answer ready\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nDon’t rely on network safeguards and firewalls to protect your\ninformation. Look to your most vulnerable spot. You’ll usually find that\nvulnerability lies in your people.\n\"Okay,\" the sys admin told him, \"you convinced me.\"\nIt was as simple as that. The sys admin had verified the name Joseph\nJones, the department, and the employee number, and \"Joe\" had given the\nright answer to the test question. \"Your username’s going to be the same\nas your corporate one, jbjones,\" the sys admin said, \"and I’m giving you\nan initial password of ’changeme.’\"\nAnalyzing the Con\nWith a couple of phone calls and fifteen minutes of time, the attacker had\ngained access to the company’s wide area network. This was a company\nthat, like many, had what I refer to as candy security, after a description\nfirst used by two Bell Labs researchers, Steve Bellovin and Steven\nCheswick. They described such security as \"a hard crunchy shell with a\noft chewy center\" - like an M&M candy. The outer shell, the firewall,\nBellovin and Cheswick argued, is not sufficient protection, because once\nan intruder is able to circumvent it, the internal computer systems have\nsoft, chewy security. Most of the time, they are inadequately protected.\nThis story fits the definition. With a dial-up number and an account,\nthe attacker didn’t even have to bother trying to defeat an Internet firewall,\nand, once inside, he was easily able to compromise most of the systems\non the internal network.\nThrough my sources, I understand this exact ruse was worked on one of\nthe largest computer software manufacturers in the world. You would\nthink the systems administrators in such a company would be trained to\ndetect this type of ruse. But in my experience, nobody is completely safe\nif a social engineer is clever and persuasive enough.\n\nLINGO\nCANDY SECURITY A term coined by Bellovin and\nCheswick of Bell Labs to describe a security scenario\nwhere the outer perimeter, such as firewall, is strong,\nbut the infrastructure behind it is weak. The term\nrefers to M&M candy, which has a hard outer shell\nand soft center.\n\nLINGO\nSPEAKEASY SECURITY Security that relies on knowing where\ndesired information is, and using a word or name to gain access to that\ninformation or computer system.\n\nSPEAKEASY SECURITY\nIn the old days of speakeasies - those Prohibition-era nightclubs where so-\ncalled bathtub gin flowed--a would-be customer gained admission by\nshowing up at the door and knocking. After a few moments, a small flap\nin the door would swing open and a tough, intimidating face would peer\nout. If the visitor was in the know, he would speak the name of some\nfrequent patron of the place (\"Joe sent me\" was often enough), whereupon\nthe bouncer inside would unlatch the door and let him in.\nThe real trick lay in knowing the location of the speakeasy because the\ndoor was unmarked, and the owners didn’t exactly hang out neon signs to\nmark their presence. For the most part, just showing up at the right place\nwas about all it took to get in. The same degree of safekeeping is,\nunhappily, practiced widely in the corporate world, providing a level of\nnon protection that I call speakeasy security.\nI Saw It at the Movies\nHere’s an illustration from a favorite movie that many people will\nremember. In Three Days of the Condor the central character, Turner\n(played by Robert Redford), works for a small research firm contracted by\nthe CIA. One day he comes back from a lunch run to find that all his co\nworkers have been gunned down. He’s left to figure out who has done this\nand why, all the while knowing that the bad guys, whoever they are, are\nlooking for him.\nLate in the story, Turner manages to get the phone number of one the bad\nguys. But who is this person, and how can Turner pin down his location?\nHe’s in luck: The screenwriter, David Rayfiel, has happily given Turner a\nbackground that includes training as a telephone lineman with the Army\nSignal Corps, making him knowledgeable about techniques and practices\nof the phone company. With the bad guy’s phone number in hand, Turner\nknows exactly what to do. In the screenplay, the scene reads like this:\nTURNER RECONNECTS and TAPS OUT ANOTHER NUMBER.\nRING! RING! Then:\nWOMAN’S VOICE (FILTER) CNA, Mrs. Coleman speaking.\nTURNER (into test set)\nThis is Harold Thomas, Mrs. Coleman. Customer Service.\nCNA on 202-555-7389, please.\nWOMAN’S VOICE (FILTER) One moment, please. (almost at once)\nLeonard Atwood, 765 MacKensie Lane, Chevy Chase, Maryland.\nIgnoring the fact that the screenwriter mistakenly uses a Washington,\nD.C., area code for a Maryland address, can you spot what just happened\nhere?\nTurner, because of his training as a telephone lineman, knew what number\nto dial in order to reach a phone company office called CNA, the\nCustomer Name and Address bureau. CNA is set up for the convenience\nof installers and other authorized phone company personnel. An installer\ncould call CNA, and give them a phone number. The CNA clerk would\nrespond by providing the name of the person the phone belongs to and\nhis address.\nFooling the Phone Company\nIn the real world, the phone number for CNA is a closely guarded secret.\nAlthough the phone companies finally caught on and these days are less\ngenerous about handing out information so readily, at the time they\noperated\non a variation of speakeasy security that security professionals call\nsecurity through obscurity. They presumed that anybody who called\nCNA\nand knew the proper lingo (\"Customer service. CNA on 555-1234,\nplease for example) was a person authorized to have the information.\n\nLINGO\nSECURITY THROUGH OBSCURITY An ineffective method of\ncomputer security that relies on keeping secret the details of how the\nsystem works (protocols, algorithms, and internal systems). Security\nthrough obscurity relies on the false assumption that no one outside a\ntrusted group of people will be able to circumvent the system.\n\nMITNICK MESSGAE\nSecurity through obscurity does not have any effect in blocking social\nengineering attacks. Every computer system in the world has at least one\nhuman that use it. So, if the attacker is able to manipulate people who use\nthe systems, the obscurity of the system is irrelevant.\nThere was no need to verify or identify oneself, no need to give an\nemployee number, no need for a password that was changed daily. If you\nknew the number to call and you sounded authentic, then you must be\nentitled to the information.\nThat was not a very solid assumption on the part of the telephone\ncompany. Their only effort at security was to change the phone number\non l periodic basis, at least once a year. Even so, the current number at\nany particular moment was very widely known among phone phreaks,\nwho delighted in taking advantage of this convenient source of\ninformation and in sharing the how-to-do-it with their fellow phreaks. The\nCN,’ Bureau trick was one of the first things I learned when I was in to the\nhobby of phone phreaking as a teenager.\nThroughout the world of business and government, speakeasy security. is\nstill prevalent. It’s likely that\nabout your company’s departments, people, and lingo. Sometimes les to\nthan that: Sometimes an internal phone number is all it takes.\n\nTHE CARELESS COMPUTER MANAGER\nThough many employees in organizations are negligent, unconcerned, or\nunaware of security dangers, you’d expect someone with the title manager\nin the computer center of a Fortune 500 corporation to be thoroughly\nknowledgeable about best security practices, right?\nYou would not expect a computer center manager - someone who is part\nof his company’s Information Technology department - to fall victim to a\nsimplistic and obvious social engineering con game. Especially not the\nsocial engineer is hardly more than a kid, barely out of his teens. But\nsometimes your expectations can be wrong.\nTuning In\nYears ago it was an amusing pastime for many people to keep a radio\ntuned to the local police or fire department frequencies, listening in on the\noccasional highly charged conversations about a bank robbery in progress,\nan office building on fire, or a high-speed chase as the event unfolded.\nThe radio frequencies used by law enforcement agencies and fire\ndepartments used to be available in books at the corner bookstore; today\nthey’re provided in listings on the Web, and from a book you can buy at\nRadio Shack frequencies for local, county, state, and, in some cases, even\nfederal agencies.\nOf course, it wasn’t just the curious who were listening in. Crooks robbing\na store in the middle of the night could tune in to hear if a police car was\nbeing dispatched to the location. Drug dealers could keep a check on\nactivities of the local Drug Enforcement Agency agents. An arsonist could\nenhance his sick pleasure by lighting a blaze and then listening to all the\nradio traffic while firemen struggled to put it out.\nOver recent years developments in computer technology have made it\npossible to encrypt voice messages. As engineers found ways to cram\nmore and more computing power onto a single microchip, they began to\nbuild small, encrypted radios for law enforcement that kept the bad guys\nand the curious from listening in.\nDanny the Eavesdropper\nA scanner enthusiast and skilled hacker we’ll call Danny decided to see if\nhe couldn’t find a way to get his hands on the super-secret encryption\nsoftware - the source code - from one of the top manufacturers of secure\nradio systems. He was hoping a study of the code would enable him to\nlearn how to eavesdrop on law enforcement, and possibly also use the\ntechnology so that even the most powerful government agencies would\nfind it difficult to monitor his conversations with his friends.\nThe Dannys of the shadowy world of hackers belong to a special category\nthat falls somewhere in between the merely-curious but-entirely- benign\nand the dangerous. Dannys have the knowledge of the expert, combined\nwith the mischievous hacker’s desire to break into systems and networks\nfor the intellectual challenge and for the pleasure of gaining insight into\nhow technology works. But their electronic breaking-and- entering stunts\nare just that--stunts. These folks, these benign hackers, illegally enter sites\nfor the sheer fun and exhilaration of proving they can do it. They don’t\nsteal anything, they don’t make any money from their exploits; they don’t\ndestroy any files, disrupt any network connections, or crash any computer\nsystem. The mere fact of their being there, snaring copies of files and\nsearching emails for passwords behind the backs of curity and network\nadministrators, tweaks the noses of the people\nresponsible for keeping out intruders like them. The one-upmanship is a\nbig part of the satisfaction.\nIn keeping with this profile, our Danny wanted to examine the details of\nhis target company’s most closely guarded product just to satisfy his own\nburning curiosity and to admire whatever clever innovations the\nmanufacturer might have come up with.\nThe product designs were, needless to say, carefully guarded trade secrets,\nas precious and protected as just about anything in the company’s\npossession. Danny knew that. And he didn(cid:146)t care a bit. After all, it was\njust some big, nameless company.\nBut how to get the software source code? As it turned out, grabbing the\ncrown jewels of the company’s Secure Communications Group proved to\nbe all too easy, even though the company was one of those that used two-\nfactor authentication, an arrangement under which people are required to\nuse not one but two separate identifiers to prove their identity.\nHere’s an example you’re probably already familiar with. When your\nrenewal credit card arrives, you’re asked to phone the issuing company to\nlet them know that the card is in possession of the intended customer, and\nnot somebody who stole the envelope from the mail. The instructions with\nthe card these days generally tell you to call from home. When you\ncall, software at the credit card company analyzes the ANI, the automatic\nnumber identification, which is provided by the telephone switch on toll-\nfree calls that the credit card company is paying for.\nA computer at the credit card company uses the calling party’s number\nprovided by the ANI, and matches that number against the company’s\ndatabase of cardholders. By the time the clerk comes on the line, her or\nhis display shows information from the database giving details about the\ncustomer. So the clerk already knows the call is coming from the home of\na customer; that’s one form of authentication.\n\nLINGO\nTWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION The use of two different types\nof authentication to verify identity. For example, a person might have to\nidentify himself by calling from a certain identifiable location and\nknowing a password.\nThe clerk then picks an item from the information displayed about\nyou - most often social security number, date of birth, or mother’s maiden\nname - and asks you for this piece of information. If you give the right\nanswer, that’s a second form of authentication - based on information you\nshould know.\nAt the company manufacturing the secure radio systems in our story,\nevery employee with computer access had their usual account name and\npassword, but in addition was provided with a small electronic device\ncalled Secure ID. This is what’s called a time-based token. These devices\ncome in two types: One is about half the size of a credit card but a little\nthicker; another is small enough that people simply attach it to their key\nchains.\nDerived from the world of cryptography, this particular gadget has a small\nwindow that displays a series of six digits. Every sixty seconds, the\ndisplay changes to show a different six-digit number. When an authorized\nperson needs to access the network from offsite, she must first identify\nherself as an authorized user by typing in her secret PIN and the digits\ndisplayed on her token device. Once verified by the internal system, she\nthen authenticates with her account name and password.\nFor the young hacker Danny to get at the source code he so coveted, he\nwould have to not only compromise some employee’s account name and\npassword (not much of a challenge for the experienced social engineer)\nbut also get around the time-based token.\nDefeating the two-factor authentication of a time-based token combined\nwith a user’s secret PIN code sounds like a challenge right out of Mission\nImpossible. But for social engineers, the challenge is similar to that aced\nby a poker player who has more than the usual skill at reading his\nopponents. With a little luck, when he sits down at a table he knows he’s\nlikely to walk away with a large pile of other people’s money.\nStorming the Fortress\nDanny began by doing his homework. Before long he had managed to put\ntogether enough pieces to masquerade as a real employee. He had an\nemployee’s name, department, phone number, and employee number, as\nwell as the manager’s name and phone number.\nNow was the calm before the storm. Literally. Going by the plan he had\nworked out, Danny needed one more thing before he could take the next\nstep, and it was something he had no control over: He needed a snow-\nstorm. Danny needed a little help from Mother Nature in the form of\nweather so bad that it would keep workers from getting into the office. In\nthe winter in South Dakota, where the manufacturing plant in question\nwas located, anyone hoping for bad weather did not have very long\nto wait. On Friday night, a storm arrived. What had begun as snow\nquickly turned to freezing rain so that, by morning, the roads were coated\nwith a slick, dangerous sheet of ice. For Danny, this was a perfect\nopportunity.\nHe telephoned the plant, asked for-the computer room and reached one of\nthe worker bees of IT, a computer operator who announced himself as\nRoger Kowalski.\nGiving the name of the real employee he had obtained, Danny said, \"This\nis Bob Billings. I work in the Secure Communications Group. I’m at home\nright now and I can’t drive in because of the storm. And the problem is\nthat I need to access my workstation and the server from home, and I left\nmy Secure ID in my desk. Can you go fetch it for me? Or can somebody?\nAnd then read off my code when I need to get in? Because my team has a\ncritical deadline and there’s no way I can get my work done. And there’s\nno way I can get to the office--the roads are much too dangerous up my\nway.\nThe computer operator said, \"I can’t leave the Computer Center.\" Danny\njumped right in: \"Do you have a Secure ID yourself?.\"\n\"There’s one here in the Computer Center,\" he said. \"We keep one for the\noperators in case of an emergency.\"\n\"Listen,\" Danny said. \"Can you do me a big favor? When I need to dial\ninto the network, can you let me borrow your Secure ID? Just until it’s\nsafe to drive in.\"\n\"Who are you again?\" Kowalski asked.\n\"Who do you work for.\n\"For Ed Trenton.\"\n\"Oh, yeah, I know him.\"\nWhen he’s liable to be faced with tough sledding, a good social engineer\ndoes more than the usual amount of research. \"I’m on the second floor,\"\nDanny went on. \"Next to Roy Tucker.\"\nHe knew that name, as well. Danny went back to work on him. \"It’d be\nmuch easier just to go to my desk and fetch my Secure ID for me.\"\nDanny was pretty certain the guy would not buy into this. First of all, he\nwould not want to leave in the middle of his shift to go traipsing down\ncorridors and up staircases to some distant part of the building. He would\nalso not want to have to paw through someone else’s desk, violating\nsomebody’s personal space. No, it was a safe bet he wouldn’t want to do\nthat.\nKowalski didn’t want to say no to a guy who needed some help, but he\ndidn’t want to say yes and get in trouble, either. So he sidestepped the\ndecision: I’ll have to ask my boss. Hang on.\" He put the phone down, and\nDanny could hear him pick up another phone, put in the call, and explain\nthe request. Kowalski then did something unexplainable: He actually\nvouched for the man using the name Bob Billings. \"I know him,\" he told\nhis manager. \"He works for Ed Trenton. Can we let him use the Secure ID\nin the Computer Center’ Danny, holding on to the phone, was amazed to\noverhear this extraordinary and unexpected support for his cause. He\ncouldn’t believe his ears or his luck.\nAfter another couple of moments, Kowalski came back on the line and\nsaid, \"My manager wants to talk to you himself,\" and gave him the man’s\nname and cell phone number.\nDanny called the manager and went through the whole story one more\ntime, adding details about the project he was working or and why his\nproduct team needed to meet a critical deadline. \"It’d be easier if someone\njust goes and fetches my card,\" he said. \"I don’t think the desk is locked,\nit should be there in my upper left drawer.\"\n\"Well,\" said the manager, \"just for the weekend, I think we can let you\nuse the one in the Computer Center. I’ll tell the guys on duty that when\nyou call, they should read off the random-access code for you,\" and he\ngave him the PIN number to use with it.\nFor the whole weekend, every time Danny wanted to get into the\ncorporate computer system, he only had to call the Computer Center and\nask them to read off the six digits displayed on the Secure ID token.\nAn Inside Job\nOnce he was inside the company’s computer system, then what? How\nwould Danny find his way to the server with the software he wanted?\nHe had already prepared for this.\nMany computer users are familiar with newsgroups, that extensive set of\nelectronic bulletin boards where people can post questions that other\npeople answer, or find virtual companions who share an interest in music,\ncomputers, or any of hundreds of other topics.\nWhat few people realize when they post any message on a newsgroup\nsite is that their message remains on line and available for years. Google,\nfor example, now maintains an archive of seven hundred million\nmessages,\nsome dating back twenty years! Danny started by going to the Web\naddress\nhttp://groups.google.com.\nAs search terms, Danny entered \"encryption radio communications\" and\nthe name of the company, and found a years-old message on the subject\nfrom an employee. It was a posting that had been made back when the\ncompany was first developing the product, probably long before police\ndepartments and federal agencies had considered scrambling radio\nsignals.\nThe message contained the sender’s signature, giving not just the man’s\nname, Scott Press, but his phone number and even the name of his\nworkgroup, the Secure Communications Group.\nDanny picked up the phone and dialed the number. It seemed like a long\nshot--would he still be working in the same organization years later?\nWould he be at work on such a stormy weekend? The phone rang once,\ntwice, three times, and then a voice came on the line. \"This is Scott,\" he\nsaid.\nClaiming to be from the company’s IT Department, Danny manipulated\nPress (in one of the ways now familiar to you from earlier chapters) into\nrevealing the names of the servers he used for development work. These\nwere the servers that could be expected to hold the source code containing\nthe proprietary encryption algorithm and firmware used in the company’s\nsecure radio products.\nDanny was moving closer and closer, and his excitement was building. He\nwas anticipating the rush, the great high he always felt when he succeeded\nat something he knew only a very limited number of people could\naccomplish.\nStill, he wasn’t home free yet. For the rest of the weekend he’d be able to\nget into the company’s network whenever he wanted to, thanks to that\ncooperative computer center manager. And he knew which servers he\nwanted to access. But when he dialed in, the terminal server he logged on\nto would not permit him to connect to the Secure Communications Group\ndevelopment systems. There must have been an internal firewall or router\nprotecting the computer systems of that group. He’d have to find some\nother way in.\nThe next step took nerve: Danny called back to Kowalski in Computer\nOperations and complained \"My server won’t let me connect,\" and told\nthe IT guy, \"I need you to set me up with an account on one of the\ncomputers in your department so I can use Telnet to connect to my\nsystem.\"\nThe manager had already approved disclosing the access code displayed\non the time-based token, so this new request didn’t seem unreasonable.\nKowalski set up a temporary account and password on one of the\nOperation Center’s computers, and told Danny to \"call me back when you\ndon’t need it any more and I’ll remove it.\"\nOnce logged into the temporary account, Danny was able to connect over\nthe network to the Secure Communications Group’s computer systems.\nAfter an hour of on-line searching for a technical vulnerability that would\ngive him access to a main development server, he hit the jackpot.\nApparently the system or network administrator wasn’t vigilant in keeping\nup with the latest news on security bugs in the operating system that\nallowed remote access. But Danny was.\nWithin a short time he had located the source code files that he was after\nand was transferring them remotely to an e-commerce site that offered\nfree storage space. On this site, even if the files were ever discovered,\nthey would never be traced back to him.\nHe had one final step before signing off: the methodical process of erasing\nhis tracks. He finished before the Jay Leno show had gone off the air for\nthe night. Danny figured this had been one very good weekend’s work.\nAnd he had never had to put himself personally at risk. It was an\nintoxicating thrill, even better than snowboarding or skydiving.\nDanny got drunk that night, not on scotch, gin, beer, or sake, but on his\nsense of power and accomplishment as he poured through the files he had\nstolen, closing in on the elusive, extremely secret radio software.\nAnalyzing the Con\nAs in the previous story, this ruse only worked because one company\nemployee was all too willing to accept at face value that a caller was\nreally the employee he claimed to be. That eagerness to help out a co\nworker with a problem is, on the one hand, part of what greases the\nwheels of industry, and part of what makes the employees of some\ncompanies more pleasant to work with than employees of others. But on\nthe other hand, this helpfulness can be a major vulnerability that a social\nengineer will attempt to exploit.\nOne bit of manipulation Danny used was delicious: When he made the\nrequest that someone get his Secure ID from his desk, he kept saying he\nwanted somebody to \"fetch\" it for him. Fetch is a command you give your\ndog. Nobody wants to be told to fetch something. With that one word,\nDanny made it all the more certain the request would be refused and some\nother solution accepted instead, which was exactly what he wanted.\nThe Computer Center operator, \"Kowalski, was taken in by Danny\ndropping the names of people Kowalski happened to know. But why\nwould Kowalski’s manager - an IT manager, no less - allow some stranger\naccess to the company’s internal network? Simply because the call for\nhelp can be a powerful, persuasive tool in the social engineer’s arsenal.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nThis story goes to show that time-based tokens and similar forms of\nauthentication are not a defense against the wily social engineer. The only\ndefense is a conscientious employee who follows security policies and\nunderstands how others can maliciously influence his behavior.\nCould something like that ever happen in your company? Has it already?\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nIt seems to be an often-repeated element in these stories that an attacker\narranges to dial in to a computer network from outside the company,\nwithout the person who helps him taking sufficient measures to verify that\nthe caller is really an employee and entitled to the access. Why do I return\nto this theme so often? Because it truly is a factor in so many social\nengineering attacks. For the social engineer, it’s the easiest way to reach\nhis goal. Why should an attacker spend hours trying to break in, when he\ncan do it instead with a simple phone call?\nOne of the most powerful methods for the social engineer to carry out\nthis kind of attack is the simple ploy of pretending to need help - an\napproach frequently used by attackers. You don’t want to stop your\nemployees from being helpful to co workers or customers, so you need to\narm them with specific verification procedures to use with anybody\nmaking a request for computer access or confidential information. That\nway they can be helpful to those who deserve to be helped, but at the\nsame time protect the organization’s information assets and computer\nsystems.\nCompany security procedures need to spell out in detail what kind of\nverification mechanisms should be used in various circumstances. Chapter\n17 provides a detailed list of procedures, but here are some guidelines to\nconsider:\nOne good way to verify the identity of a person making a\nrequest is to call the phone number listed in the company\ndirectory for that person. If the person making the request is\nactually an attacker, the verification call will either let you\nspeak to the real person on the phone while the imposter is on\nhold, or you will reach the employee’s voice mail so that you\ncan listen to the sound of his voice, and compare it to the\nspeech of the attacker.\nIf employee numbers are used in your company for verifying identity,\nthen those numbers have to be treated as sensitive information, carefully\nguarded and not given out to strangers. The same goes for all other kinds\nof internal identifiers, such as internal telephone numbers, departmental\nbilling identifiers, and even email addresses.\nCorporate training should call everyone’s attention to the common\npractice of accepting unknown people as legitimate employees on the\ngrounds that they sound authoritative or knowledgeable. Just because\nsomebody knows a company practice or uses internal terminology is no\nreason to assume that his identity doesn’t need to be verified in other\nways.\nSecurity officers and system administrators must not narrow their focus so\nthat they are only alert to how security-conscious everyone else is being.\nThey also need to make sure they themselves are following the same\nrules, procedures, and practices.\nPasswords and the like must, of course, never be shared, but the\nrestriction against sharing is even more important with time-based tokens\nand other secure forms of authentication. It should be a matter of common\nsense that sharing any of these items violates the whole point of the\ncompany’s having installed the systems. Sharing means there can be no\naccountability. If a security incident takes place or something goes wrong,\nyou won’t be able to determine who the responsible party is.\nAs I reiterate throughout this book, employees need to be familiar with\nsocial engineering strategies and methods to thoughtfully analyze requests\nthey receive. Consider using role-playing as a standard part of security\ntraining, so that employees can come to a better understanding of how the\nsocial engineer works.",
    "question": "What is the key concept discussed in the text regarding the vulnerability of corporate security systems to social engineering attacks?",
    "summary": "The chapter discusses how social engineers manipulate people by pretending to need help, often bypassing security measures. It uses examples like Brian Atterby, who gained access to a company's network by impersonating an employee, and Danny, who exploited a snowstorm to trick an IT manager into granting him access. The text emphasizes that human vulnerability, not technical defenses, is the main weakness in security, and highlights the importance of verifying identities and following proper procedures to prevent such attacks."

    "text": "Chapter 7\nPhony Sites and Dangerous Attachments\nThere(cid:146)s an old saying that you never get something for nothing,\nStill, the ploy of offering something for free continues to be a big draw for\nboth legitimate (\"But wait--there’s more! Call right now and we’ll throw in\na set of knives and a popcorn popper!\") and not-so- legitimate (\"Buy one\nacre of swampland in Florida and get a second acre free!\") businesses.\nAnd most of us are so eager to get something free that we may be\ndistracted from thinking clearly about the offer or the promise being\nmade.\nWe know the familiar warning, \"buyer beware,\" but it’s time to heed\nanother warning: Beware of come-on email attachments and free\nsoftware. The savvy attacker will use nearly any means to break into the\ncorporate network, including appealing to our natural desire to get a free\ngift. Here are a few examples.\nWOULDN’T YOU LIKE A FREE (BLANK)?\"\nJust as viruses have been a curse to mankind and medical practitioners\nsince the beginning of time, so the aptly named computer virus represents\na similar curse to users of technology. The computer viruses that get most\nof the attention and end up in the spotlight, not coincidentally, do the most\ndamage. These are the product of computer vandals.\nComputer nerds turned malicious, computer vandals strive to show off\nhow clever they are. Sometimes their acts are like a rite of initiation,\nmeant to impress older and more experienced hackers. These people are\nmotivated to create a worm or virus intended to inflict damage. If their\nwork\ndestroys files, trashes entire hard drives, and emails itself to thousands of\nunsuspecting people, vandals puff with pride at their accomplishment. If\nthe virus causes enough chaos that newspapers write about it and the\nnetwork news broadcasts warn against it, so much the better.\nMuch has been written about vandals and their viruses; books, software\nprograms, and entire companies have been created to offer protection, and\nwe won’t deal here with the defenses against their technical attacks. Our\ninterest at the moment is less in the destructive acts of the vandal than in\nthe more targeted efforts of his distant cousin, the social engineer.\nIt Came in the Email\nYou probably receive unsolicited emails every day that carry advertising\nmessages or offer a free something-or-other that you neither need nor\nwant. You know the kind. They promise investment advice, discounts on\ncomputers, televisions, cameras, vitamins, or travel, offers for credit cards\nyou don’t need, a device that will let you receive pay television channels\nfree, ways to improve your health or your sex life, and on and on.\nBut every once in a while an offer pops up in your electronic mailbox for\nsomething that catches your eye. Maybe it’s a free game, an offer of\nphotos of your favorite star, a free calendar program, or inexpensive\nshare\" ware that will protect your computer against viruses. Whatever the\noffer, the email directs you to download the file with the goodies that the\nmessage has convinced you to try.\nOr maybe you receive a message with a subject line that reads Don, I miss\nyou,\" or \"Anna, why haven’t you written me,\" or \"Hi, Tim, here’s the sexy\nphoto I promised you.\" This couldn’t be junk advertising mail, you think,\nbecause it has your own name on it and sounds so personal. So you open\nthe attachment to see the photo or read the message.\nAll of these actions--downloading software you learned about from an\nadvertising email, clicking on a link that takes you to a site you haven’t\nheard of before, opening an attachment from someone you don’t really\nknow--are invitations to trouble. Sure, most of the time what you get is\nexactly what you expected, or at worst something disappointing or\noffensive, but harmless. But sometimes what you get is the handiwork of\na vandal.\nSending malicious code to your computer is only a small part of the\nattack. The attacker needs to persuade you to download the attachment for\nthe attack to succeed.\n\nNOTE\nOne type of program know in the computer underground as a RAT, or\nRemote Access Trojan, gives the attacker full access to your computer,\njust as if he were sitting at your keyboard.\nThe most damaging forms of malicious code - worms with names like\nLove Letter, SirCam, and Anna Kournikiva, to name a few - have all\nrelied on social engineering techniques of deception and taking advantage\nof our desire to get something for nothing in order to be spread. The worm\narrives as an attachment to an email that offers something tempting, such\nas confidential information, free pornography, or - a very clever ruse - a\nmessage saying that the attachment is the receipt for some expensive item\nyou supposedly ordered. This last ploy leads you to open the attachment\nfor fear your credit card has been charged for an item you didn’t order.\nIt’s astounding how many people fall for these tricks; even after being told\nand told again about the dangers of opening email attachments, awareness\nof the danger fades over time, leaving each of us vulnerable.\nSpotting Malicious Software\nAnother kind of malware - short for malicious software - puts a program\nonto your computer that operates without your knowledge or consent, or\nperforms a task without your awareness. Malware may look innocent\nenough, may even be a Word document or PowerPoint presentation, or\nany program that has macro functionality, but it will secretly install an\nunauthorized program. For example, malware may be a version of the\nTrojan Horse talked about in Chapter 6. Once this software is installed on\nyour machine, it can feed every keystroke you type back to the attacker,\nincluding all your passwords and credit card numbers.\nThere are two other types of malicious software you may find shocking.\nOne can feed the attacker every word you speak within range of your\ncomputer microphone, even when you think the microphone is turned off.\nWorse, if you have a Web cam attached to your computer, an attacker\nusing a variation of this technique may be able to capture everything that\ntakes place in front of your terminal, even when you think the camera is\noff, day or night.\n\nLINGO\nMALWARE Slang for malicious software, a computer program, such as\na virus, worm, or Trojan Horse, that performs damaging tasks.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nBeware of geeks bearing gifts, otherwise your company might endure the\nsame fate as the city of Troy. When in doubt, to avoid an infection, use\nprotection.\nA hacker with a malicious sense of humor might try to plant a little\nprogram designed to be wickedly annoying on your computer. For\nexample, it might make your CD drive tray keep popping open, or the file\nyou’re working on keep minimizing. Or it might cause an audio file to\nplay a scream at full volume in the middle of the night. None of these is\nmuch fun when you’re trying to get sleep or get work done.., but at least\nthey don’t do any lasting damage.\n\nMESSAGE FROM A FRIEND\nThe scenarios can get even worse, despite your precautions. Imagine:\nYou’ve decided not to take any chances. You will no longer download any\nfiles except from secure sites that you know and trust, such as\nSecurityFocus.com or Amazon.com. You no longer click on links in email\nfrom unknown sources. You no longer open attachments in any email that\nyou were not expecting. And you check your browser page to make sure\nthere is a secure site symbol on every site you visit for e-commerce\ntransactions or to exchange confidential information.\nAnd then one day you get an email from a friend or business associate that\ncarries an attachment. Couldn’t be anything malicious if it comes from\nsomeone you know well, right? Especially since you would know who to\nblame if your computer data were damaged.\nYou open the attachment, and... BOOM! You just got hit with a worm or\nTrojan Horse. Why would someone you know do this to you? Because\nsome things are not as they appear. You’ve read about this: the worm that\ngets onto someone’s computer, and then emails itself to everyone in that\nperson’s address book. Each of those people gets an email from someone\nhe knows and trusts, and each of those trusted emails contains the worm,\nwhich propagates itself like the ripples from a stone thrown into a still\npond.\nThe reason this technique is so effective is that it follows the theory of\nkilling two birds with one stone: The ability to propagate to other\nunsuspecting victims, and the appearance that it originated from a trusted\nperson.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nMan has invented many wonderful things that have changed the world\nand our way of life. But for every good use of technology, whether a\ncomputer, telephone, or the Internet, someone will always find a way to\nabuse it for his or her own purposes.\nIt’s a sad fact of life in the current state of technology that you may get an\nemail from someone close to you and still have to wonder if it’s safe to\nopen.\n\nVARIATIONS ON A THEME\nIn this era of the Internet, there is a kind of fraud that involves\nmisdirecting you to a Web site that is not what you expected. This\nhappens regularly, and it takes a variety of forms. This example, which is\nbased on an actual scam perpetrated on the Internet, is representative.\nMerry Christmas. . .\nA retired insurance salesman named Edgar received an email one day\nfrom\nPayPal, a company that offers a fast and convenient way of making online\npayments. This kind of service is especially handy when a person in one\npart of the country (or the world, for that matter) is buying an item from\nan individual he doesn’t know. PayPal charges the purchaser’s credit card\nand transfers the money directly to the seller’s account.\nAs a collector of antique glass jars Edgar did a lot of business through\nthe on-line auction company eBay. He used PayPal often, sometimes\nseveral times a week. So Edgar was interested when he received an email\nin\nthe holiday season of 2001 that seemed to be from PayPal, offering him a\nreward for updating his PayPal account. The message read:\nSeason’s Greetings Valued PayPal Customer;\nAs the New Year approaches and as we all get ready to move a year\nahead, PayPal would like to give you a $5 credit to your account!\nAll you have to do to claim your $5 gift from us is update your\ninformation on our secure Pay Pal site by January 1st, 2002. A year\nbrings a lot of changes, by updating your information with us you will\nallow for us to continue providing you and our valued customer service\nwith excellent service and in the meantime, keep our records straight!\nTo update your information now and to receive $5 in your PayPal account\ninstantly,\nclick this link:\nhttp://www, paypal -secure. com/cgi bin\nThank you for using PayPal.com and helping us grow to be the largest of\nour kind!\nSincerely wishing you a very \"Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,\"\nPayPal Team\nA Note about E.commerce Web Sites\nYou probably know people who are reluctant to buy goods on line, even\nfrom brand-name companies such as Amazon and eBay, or the Web sites\nof Old Navy, Target, or Nike. In a way, they’re right to be suspicious. If\nyour browser uses today’s standard of 128-bit encryption, the information\nyou send to any secure site goes out from your computer encrypted. This\ndata could be unencrypted with a lot of effort, but probably is not\nbreakable in a reasonable amount of time, except perhaps by the National\nSecurity Agency (and the NSA, so far 98 as we know, has not shown any\ninterest in stealing credit card numbers of American citizens or trying to\nfind out who is ordering sexy videotapes or kinky underwear).\nThese encrypted files could actually be broken by anyone with the time\nand resources. But really, what fool would go to all that effort to steal one\ncredit card number when many e-commerce companies make the mistake\nof storing all their customer financial information unencrypted in their\ndatabases? Worse, a number of e-commerce companies that use a\nparticular SQL database software badly compound the problem: They\nhave never changed the default system administrator password for the\nprogram. When they took the software out of the box, the password was\n\"null,\" and it’s still \"null\" today. So the contents of the database are\navailable to anyone on the Internet who decides to try to connect to the\ndatabase server. These sites are under attack all the time and information\ndoes get stolen, without anyone being the wiser,\nOn the other hand, the same people who won’t buy on the Internet because\nthey’re afraid of having their credit card information stolen\nhave no problem buying with that same credit card in a brick-and- mortar\nstore, or paying for lunch, dinner, or drinks with the card\neven in a back-street bar or restaurant they wouldn’t take their mother to.\nCredit card receipts get stolen from these places all the time, or fished out\nof trash bins in the back alley. And any unscrupulous clerk or waiter can\njot down your name and card info, or use a gadget readily available on the\nInternet, a card-swiping device that stores data from any credit card\npassed through it, for later retrieval.\nThere are some hazards to shopping on line, but it’s probably as safe as\nshopping in a bricks-and-mortar store. And the credit card companies\noffer you the same protection when using your card on line--if any\nfraudulent charges get made to the account, you’re only responsible for\nthe first $50.\nSo in my opinion, fear of shopping online is just another misplaced\nworry.\nEdgar didn’t notice any of the several tell-tale signs that something was\nwrong with this email (for example, the semicolon after the greeting line,\nand the garbled text about \"our valued customer service with excellent\nservice\"). He clicked on the link, entered the information requested -\nname, address, phone number, and credit card information - and sat. back\nto wait for the five-dollar credit to show up on his next credit-card bill.\nWhat showed up instead was a list of charges for items he never\npurchased.\nAnalyzing the Con\nEdgar had been taken in by a commonplace Internet scam. It’s a scam that\ncomes in a variety of forms. One of them (detailed in Chapter 9) involves\na decoy login screen created by the attacker that looks identical to the real\nthing. The difference is that the phony screen doesn’t give access to the\ncomputer system that the user is trying to reach, but instead feeds his\nusername and password to the hacker.\nEdgar had been taken in by a scam in which the crooks had registered a\nWeb site with the name \"paypal-secure.com\"- which sounds as if it should\nhave been a secure page on the legitimate PayPal site, but it isn’t. When\nhe entered information on that site, the attackers got just what they\nwanted.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nWhile not foolproof (no security is), whenever visiting a site that requests\ninformation you consider private, always ensure that the connection is\nauthenticated and encrypted. And even more important, do not\nautomatically click Yes in any dialog box that may indicate a security\nissue, such as an invalid, expired, or revoked digital certificate.\n\nVARIATIONS ON THE VARIATION\nHow many other ways are there to deceive computer users into going to a\nbogus Web site where they provide confidential information? I don’t\nsuppose anyone has a valid, accurate answer, but \"lots and lots\" will serve\nthe purpose.\nThe Missing Link\nOne trick pops up regularly: Sending out an email that offers a tempting\nreason to visit a site, and provides a link for going directly to it. Except\nthat the link doesn’t take you to the site you think you’re going to, because\nthe link actually only resembles a link for that site. Here’s another exam-\npie that has actually been used on the Internet, again involving misuse of\nthe name PayPal:\nwww. PayPai. com\nAt a quick glance, this looks as if it says PayPal. Even if the victim\nnotices, he may think it’s just a slight defect in the text that makes the \"I\"\nof Pal look like an \"i.\" And who would notice at a glance that:\nwww. PayPal. com\nuses the number 1 instead of a lowercase letter L? There are enough\npeople who accept misspellings and other misdirection to make this\ngambit continually popular with credit card bandits. When people go to\nthe phony site, it looks like the site they expected to go to, and they\nblithely enter their credit card information. To set up one of these scares,\nan attacker only needs to register the phony domain name, send out his\nemails, and wait for suckers to show up, ready to be cheated.\nIn mid-2002, I received an email, apparently part of a mass mailing that\nwas marked as being from \"Ebay@ebay.com.\" The message is shown in\nFigure 8.1.\nFigure 8.1. The link in this or any other email should be used with\ncaution.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------\nmsg: Dear eBay User,\nIt has become very noticeable that another party has\nbeen corrupting your eBay account and has violated our User Agreement\npolicy listed:\n4. Bidding and Buying\nYou are obligated to complete the transaction with the\nseller if you purchase an item through one of our fixed price formats or\nare the highest bidder as described below. If you are the highest bidder at\nthe end of an auction (meeting the applicable minimum bid or reserve\nrequirements) and your bid is accepted by the seller, you are obligated to\ncomplete the transaction with the seller, or the transaction is prohibited by\nlaw or by this Agreement.\nYou received this notice from eBay because it has come\nto our attention that your current account has caused interruptions with\nother eBay members and eBay requires immediate verification for your\naccount. Please verify your account or the account may become disabled.\nClick Here To Verify Your Account - http://error ebay.tripod.com\nDesignated trademarks and brands are the property of\ntheir respective owners, eBay and the eBay logo are trademarks of eBay\nInc.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------\nVictims who clicked on the link went to a Web page that looked very\nmuch like an eBay page. In fact, the page was well designed, with an\nauthentic eBay logo, and \"Browse,\" \"Sell\" and other navigation links that,\nif clicked, took the visitor to the actual eBay site. There was also a\nsecurity logo in the bottom right corner. To deter the savvy victim, the\ndesigner had even used HTML encryption to mask where the user-\nprovided information was being sent.\nIt was an excellent example of a malicious computer-based social\nengineering attack. Still, it was not without several flaws.\nThe email message was not well written; in particular, the paragraph\nbeginning \"You received this notice\" is clumsy and inept (the people\nresponsible for these hoaxes never hire a professional to edit their copy,\nand it always shows). Also, anybody who was paying close attention\nwould have become suspicious about eBay asking for the visitor’s PayPal\ninformation; there is no reason eBay would ask a customer for this private\ninformation involving a different company.\nAnd anyone knowledgeable about the Internet would probably recognize\nthat the hyperlink connects not to the eBay domain but to tripod.com,\nwhich is a free Web hosting service. This was a dead giveaway that the\nemail was not legitimate. Still, I bet a lot of people entered their\ninformation, including a credit card number, onto this page.\n\nNOTE\nWhy are people allowed to register deceptive or inapproprate domain\nnames?. Because under current law and on-line policy, anyone can\nregister any site names that(cid:146) not already in use.\nCompanies try to fight this use of copycat addresses, but consider what\nthey(cid:146)re up against. General Motors filed suit against a company that\nregistered f**kgeneralmotors.com (but without the asterisks) and pointed\nthe URL to General Motor’s Web site. GM lost.\nBe Alert\nAs individual users of the Internet, we all need to be alert, making a\nconscious decision about when it’s okay to enter personal information,\npasswords, account numbers, PINs, and the like.\nHow many people do you know who could tell you whether a particular\nInternet page they’re looking at meets the requirements of a secure page?\nHow many employees in your company know what to look for?\nEveryone who uses the Internet should know about the little symbol that\noften appears somewhere on a Web page and looks like a drawing of a\npadlock. They should know that when the hasp is closed, the site has been\ncertified as being secure. When the hasp is open or the lock icon is\nmissing, the Web site is not authenticated as genuine, and any information\ntransmitted is in the clear--that is, unencrypted.\nHowever, an attacker who manages to compromise administrative\nprivileges on a company computer may be able to modify or patch the\noperating system code to change the user’s perception of what is really\nhappening. For example, the programming instructions in the browser\nsoftware that indicate a Web site’s digital certificate is invalid can be\nmodified to bypass the check. Or the system could be modified with\nsomething called a root kit, installing one or more back doors at the\noperating system level, which are harder to detect.\nA secure connection authenticates the site as genuine, and encrypts the\ninformation being communicated, so an attacker cannot make use of any\ndata that is intercepted. Can you trust any Web site, even one that uses a\nsecure connection? No, because the site owner may not be vigilant about\napplying all the necessary security patches, or forcing users or\nadministrators to respect good password practices. So you can’t assume\nthat any supposedly secure site is invulnerable to attack.\n\nLINGO\nBACK DOOR A covert entry point that provides a secret way into a\nuser(cid:146)s computer that is unkown to the user. Also used by programmers\nwhile developing a software program so that they can go into the program\nto fix problems\nSecure HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) or SSL (secure sockets layer)\nprovides an automatic mechanism that uses digital certificates not only to\nencrypt information being sent to the distant site, but also to provide\nauthentication (an assurance that you are communicating with the genuine\nWeb site). However, this protection mechanism does not work for users\nwho fail to pay attention to whether the site name displayed in the address\nbar is in fact the correct address of the site they’re trying to access.\nAnother security issue, mostly ignored, appears as a warning message that\nsays something like \"This site is not secure or the security certificate has\nexpired. Do you want to go to the site anyway?\" Many Internet users don’t\nunderstand the message, and when it appears, they simply click Okay or\nYes and go on with their work, unaware that they may be on quicksand.\nBe warned: On a Web site that does not use a secure protocol, you should\nnever enter any confidential information such as your address or phone\nnumber, credit card or bank account numbers, or anything else you want\nto keep private.\nThomas Jefferson said maintaining our freedom required \"eternal\nvigilance.\" Maintaining privacy and security in a society that uses\ninformation as currency requires no less.\nBecoming Virus Savvy\nA special note about virus software: It is essential for the corporate\nintranet, but also essential for every employee who uses a computer.\nBeyond just having anti virus software installed on their machines, users\nobviously need to have the software turned on (which many people don’t\nlike because it inevitably slows down some computer functions).\nWith anti virus software there’s another important procedure to keep in\nmind, as well: Keeping the virus definitions up to date. Unless your\ncompany is set up to distribute software or updates over the network to\nevery user, each individual user must carry the responsibility of\ndownloading the\nlatest set of virus definitions on his own. My personal recommendation is\nto have everyone set the virus software preferences so that new virus\ndefinitions are automatically updated every day.\n\nLINGO\nSECURE SOCKETS LAYER A protocol developed by Netscape that\nprovides authentication of both client and server in a secure\ncommunication on the internet.\nSimply put, you’re vulnerable unless the virus definitions are updated\nregularly. And even so, you’re still not completely safe from viruses or\nworms that the anti virus software companies don’t yet know about or\nhaven’t yet published a detection pattern file for.\nAll employees with remote access privileges from their laptops or home\ncomputers need to have updated virus software and a personal firewall on\nthose machines at a minimum. A sophisticated attacker will look at the\nbig picture to seek out the weakest link, and that’s where he’ll attack.\nReminding people with remote computers regularly about the need for\npersonal firewalls and updated, active virus software is a corporate\nresponsibility, because you can’t expect that individual workers,\nmanagers, sales people, and others remote from an IT department will\nremember the dangers of leaving their computers unprotected.\nBeyond these steps, I strongly recommend use of the less common, but no\nless important, software packages that guard against Trojan Horse attacks,\nso-called anti-Trojan software. At the time of this writing, two of the\nbetter-known programs are The Cleaner (www.moosoft.com), and Trojan\nDefense Sweep (www.diamondcs.com.au).\nFinally, what is probably the most important security message of all for\ncompanies that do not scan for dangerous emails at the corporate gateway:\nSince we all tend to be forgetful or negligent about things that seem\nperipheral to getting our jobs done, employees need to be reminded over\nand over again, in different ways, about not opening email attachments\nunless they are certain that the source is a person or organization they can\ntrust. And management also needs to remind employees that they must\nuse active virus software and anti-Trojan software that provides\ninvaluable protection against the seemingly trustworthy email that may\ncontain a destructive payload.\n\nChapter 8\nUsing Sympathy, Guilt, and Intimidation\nAs discussed in Chapter 15, a social engineer uses the psychology of\ninfluence to lead his target to comply with his request. Skilled social\nengineers are very adept at developing a ruse that stimulates emotions,\nsuch as fear, excitement, or guilt. They do this by using psychological\ntriggers--automatic mechanisms that lead people to respond to requests\nwithout in-depth analysis of all the available information.\nWe all want to avoid difficult situations for ourselves and others. Based\non this positive impulse, the attacker can play on a person’s sympathy,\nmake his victim feel guilty, or use intimidation as a weapon.\nHere are some graduate-school lessons in popular tactics that play on the\nemotions.\n\nA VISIT TO THE STUDIO\nHave you ever noticed how some people can walk up to the guard at the\ndoor of, say, a hotel ballroom where some meeting, private party, or book-\nlaunching function is under way, and just walk past that person without\nbeing asked for his ticket or pass?\nIn much the same way, a social engineer can talk his way into places that\nyou would not have thought possible - as the following story about the\nmovie industry makes clear.\nThe Phone Call\n\"Ron Hillyard’s office, this is Dorothy.\"\n\"Dorothy, hi. My name is Kyle Bellamy. I’ve just come on board to work\nin Animation Development on Brian Glassman’s staff. You folks sure do\nthings different over here.\"\n\"I guess. I never worked on any other movie lot so I don’t really know.\nWhat can I do for you?\"\n\"To tell you the truth, I’m feeling sort of stupid. I’ve got a writer coming\nover this afternoon for a pitch session and I don’t know who I’m supposed\nto talk to about getting him onto the lot. The people over here in Brian’s\noffice are really nice but I hate to keep bothering them, how do I do this,\nhow do I do that. It’s like I just started junior high and can’t find my way\nto the bathroom. You know what I mean?\"\nDorothy laughed.\n\"You want to talk to Security. Dial 7, and then 6138. If you\nget Lauren, tell her Dorothy said she should take good\ncare of you.\"\n\"Thanks, Dorothy. And if I can’t find the men’s room, I may call you\nback!\"\nThey chuckled together over the idea, and hung up.\nDavid Harold’s Story\nI love the movies and when I moved to Los Angeles, I thought I’d get to\nmeet all kinds of people in the movie business and they’d take me along\nto parties and have me over to lunch at the studios. Well, I was there for\na year, I was turning twenty-six years old, and the closest I got was going\non the Universal Studios tour with all the nice people from Phoenix and\nCleveland. So finally it got to the point where I figured, if they won’t\ninvite me in, I’ll invite myself. Which is what I did.\nI bought a copy of the Los Angeles Times and read the entertainment\ncolumn\nfor a couple of days, and wrote down the names of some producers\nat different studios. I decided I’d try hitting on one of the big studios first.\nSo I called the switchboard and asked for the office of this producer I\nhad read about in the paper. The secretary that answered sounded like the\nmotherly type, so I figured I had gotten lucky; if it was some young girl\nwho was just there hoping she’d be discovered, she probably wouldn’t\nhave\ngiven me the time of day.\nBut this Dorothy, she sounded like somebody that would take in a stray\nkitten, somebody who’d feel sorry for the new kid that was feeling a little\noverwhelmed on the new job. And I sure got just the right touch with her.\nIt’s not every day you try to trick somebody and they give you even more\nthan you asked for. Out of pity, she not only gave me the name of one of\nthe people in Security, but said I should tell the lady that Dorothy wanted\nher to help me.\nOf course I had planned to use Dorothy’s name anyway. This made it even\nbetter. Lauren opened right up and never even bothered to look up the\nname I gave to see if it was really in the employee database.\nWhen I drove up to the gate that afternoon, they not only had my name on\nthe visitor’s list, they even had a parking space for me. I had a late lunch\nat the commissary, and wandered the lot until the end of the day. I even\nsneaked into a couple of sound stages and watched them shooting movies.\nDidn’t leave till 7 o’clock. It was one of my most exciting days ever.\nAnalyzing the Con\nEverybody was a new employee once. We all have memories of what that\nfirst day was like, especially when we were young and inexperienced. So\nwhen a new employee asks for help, he can expect that many people--\nespecially entry-level people--will remember their own new-kid on-the-\nblock feelings and go out of their way to lend a hand. The social engineer\nknows this, and he understands that he can use it to play on the\nsympathies of his victims.\nWe make it too easy for outsiders to con their way into our company\nplants and offices. Even with guards at entrances and sign-in procedures\nfor anyone who isn’t an employee, any one of several variations on the\nruse used in this story will allow an intruder to obtain a visitor’s badge and\nwalk right in. And if your company requires that visitors be escorted?\nThat’s a good rule, but it’s only effective if your employees are truly\nconscientious about stopping anyone with or without a visitor’s badge\nwho is on his own, and questioning him. And then, if the answers aren’t\nsatisfactory, your employees have to be willing to contact security.\nMaking it too easy for outsiders to talk their way into your facilities\nendangers your company’s sensitive information. In today’s climate, with\nthe threat of terrorist attacks hanging over our society, it’s more than just\ninformation that could be at risk.\n\"DO IT NOW\"\nNot everyone who uses social engineering tactics is a polished social\nengineer. Anybody with an insider’s knowledge of a particular company\ncan turn dangerous. The risk is even greater for any company that holds in\nits files and databases any personal information about its employees,\nwhich, of course, most companies do.\nWhen workers are not educated or trained to recognize social engineering\nattacks, determined people like the jilted lady in the following story can\ndo things that most honest people would think impossible.\nDoug’s Story\nThings hadn’t been going all that well with Linda anyway, and I knew as\nsoon as I met Erin that she was the one for me. Linda is, like, a little bit...\nwell, sort of not exactly unstable but she can sort of go off the deep end\nwhen she gets upset.\nI told her as gentle as I could that she had to move out, and I helped her\npack and even let her take a couple of the Queensryche CDs that were\nreally mine. As soon as she was gone I went to the hardware store for a\nnew Medico lock to put on the front door and put it on that same night.\nThe next morning I called the phone company and had them change my\nphone number, and made it unpublished.\nThat left me free to pursue Erin.\nLinda’s Story\nI was ready to leave, anyway, I just hadn’t decided when. But nobody\nlikes to feel rejected. So it was just a question of, what could I do to let\nhim know what a jerk he was?\nIt didn’t take long to figure out. There had to be another girl, otherwise he\nwouldn’t of sent me packing in such a hurry. So I’d just wait a bit and then\nstart calling him late in the evening. You know, around the time they\nwould least want to be called.\nI waited till the next weekend and called around 11 o’clock on Saturday\nnight. Only he had changed his phone number. And the new number was\nunlisted. That just shows what kind of SOB the guy was.\nIt wasn’t that big of a setback. I started rummaging through the papers I\nhad managed to take home just before I left my job at the phone company.\nAnd there it was--I had saved a repair ticket from once when there was a\nproblem with the telephone line at Doug’s, and the printout listed\nthe cable and pair for his phone. See, you can change your phone number\nall you want, but you still have the same pair of copper wires running\nfrom\nyour house to the telephone company switching office, called the Central\nOffice, or CO. The set of copper wires from every house and apartment\nis identified by these numbers, called the cable and pair. And if you know\nhow the phone company does things, which I do, knowing the target’s\ncable and pair is all you need to find out the phone number.\nI had a list giving all the COs in the city, with their addresses and phone\nnumbers. I looked up the number for the CO in the neighborhood where\nI used to live with Doug the jerk, and called, but naturally nobody was\nthere. Where’s the switchman when you really need him? Took me all of\nabout twenty seconds to come up with a plan. I started calling around to\nthe other COs and finally located a guy. But he was miles away and he\nwas\nprobably sitting there with his feet up. I knew he wouldn’t want to do\nwhat I needed. I was ready with my plan.\n\"This is Linda, Repair Center,\" I said. \"We have an emergency. Service\nfor a paramedic unit has gone down. We have a field tech trying to\nrestore\nservice but he can’t find the problem. We need you to drive over to the\nWebster CO immediately and see if we have dial tone leaving the central\noffice.\"\nAnd then I told him, ’I’ll call you when you get there,\" because of\ncourse I couldn’t have him calling the Repair Center and asking for me.\nI knew he wouldn’t want to leave the comfort of the central office to\nbundle up and go scrape ice off his windshield and drive through the\nslush\nlate at night. But it was an emergency, so he couldn’t exactly say he was\ntoo busy.\nWhen I reached him forty-five minutes later at the Webster CO, I told\nhim to check cable 29 pair 2481, and he walked over to the flame and\nchecked and said, Yes, there was dial tone. Which of course I already\nknew.\nSo then I said, \"Okay, I need you to do an LV,\" which means line\nverification,\nwhich is asking him to identify the phone number. He does this\nby dialing a special number that reads back the number he called from.\nHe doesn’t know anything about if it’s an unlisted number or that it’s just\nbeen changed, so he did what I asked and I heard the number being\nannounced over his lineman’s test set. Beautiful. The whole thing had\nworked like a charm.\nI told him, \"Well, the problem must be out in the field,\" like I knew the\n,,umber all along. I thanked him and told him we’d keep working on it,\nand said good night.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nOnce a social engineer knows how things work inside the targeted\ncompany, it becomes easy to use that knowledge to develop rapport with\nlegitimate employees. Companies need to prepare for social engineering\nattacks from current or former employees who may have an axe to grind.\nBackground checks may be helpful to weed out prospects who may have a\npropensity toward this type of behavior. But in most cases, these people\nwill be extremely difficult to detect. The only reasonable safeguard in\nthese cases is to enforce and audit procedures for verifying identity,\nincluding the person’s employment status, prior to disclosing any\ninformation to anyone not personally known to still be with the company.\nSo much for that Doug and trying to hide from me behind an unlisted\nnumber. The fun was about to begin.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThe young lady in this story was able to get the information she wanted to\ncarry out her revenge because she had inside knowledge: the phone\nnumbers, procedures, and lingo of the telephone company. With it she\nwas not only able to find out a new, unlisted phone number, but was able\nto do it in the middle of a wintry night, sending a telephone switchman\nchasing across town for her.\n\"MR. BIGG WANTS THIS\"\nA popular and highly effective form of intimidation--popular in large\nmeasure because it’s so simple--relies on influencing human behavior by\nusing authority.\nJust the name of the assistant in the CEO’s office can be valuable. Private\ninvestigators and even head-hunters do this all the time. They’ll call the\nswitchboard operator and say they want to be connected to the CEO’s\noffice. When the secretary or executive assistant answers, they’ll say they\nhave a document or package for the CEO, or if they send an email\nattachment, would she print it out? Or else they’ll ask, what’s the fax\nnumber? And by the way, what’s your name?\nThen they call the next person, and say, \"Jeannie in Mr. Bigg’s office told\nme to call you so you can help me with something.\"\nThe technique is called name-dropping, and it’s usually used as a method\nto quickly establish rapport by influencing the target to believe that the\nattacker is connected with somebody in authority. A target is more likely\nto do a favor for someone who knows somebody he knows.\nIf the attacker has his eyes set on highly sensitive information, he may use\nthis kind of approach to stir up useful emotions in the victim, such as fear\nof getting into trouble with his superiors. Here’s an example.\nScott’s Story\n\"Scott Abrams.\"\n\"Scott, this is Christopher Dalbridge. I just got off the phone with Mr.\nBiggley, and he’s more than a little unhappy. He says he sent a note ten\ndays ago that you people were to get copies of all your market penetration\nresearch over to us for analysis. We never got a thing.\"\n\"Market penetration research? Nobody said anything to me about it.\nWhat department are you in?\"\n\"We’re a consulting firm he hired, and we’re already behind schedule.\"\n\"Listen, I’m just on my way to a meeting. Let me get your phone number\nand . . .\"\nThe attacker now sounded just short of truly frustrated: \"Is that what\nyou want me to tell Mr. Biggley?! Listen, he expects our analysis by\ntomorrow morning and we have to work on it tonight. Now, do you want\nme to tell him we couldn’t do it ’cause we couldn’t get the report from you,\nor do you want to tell him that yourself?.\"\nAn angry CEO can ruin your week. The target is likely to decide that\nmaybe this is something he better take care of before he goes into that\nmeeting. Once again, the social engineer has pressed the right button to\nget the response he wanted.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThe ruse of intimidation by referencing authority works especially well if\nthe other person is at a fairly low level in the company. The use of an\nimportant person’s name not only overcomes normal reluctance or\nsuspicion, but often makes the person eager to please; the natural instinct\nof wanting to be helpful is multiplied when you think that the person\nyou’re helping is important or influential.\nThe social engineer knows, though, that it’s best when running this\nparticular deceit to use the name of someone at a higher level than the\nperson’s own boss. And this gambit is tricky to use within a small\norganization: The attacker doesn’t want his victim making a chance\ncomment to the VP of marketing. \"I sent out the product marketing plan\nyou had that guy call me about,\" can too easily produce a response of\n\"What marketing plan? What guy?\" And that could lead to the discovery\nthat the company has been victimized.\n\nMITNICKS MESSAGE\nIntimidation can create a fear of punishment, influencing people to\ncooperate. Intimidation can also raise the fear of embarrassment or of\nbeing disqualified from that new promotion.\nPeople must be trained that it’s not only acceptable but expected to\nchallenge authority when security is at stake. Information security training\nshould include teaching people how to challenge authority in customer-\nfriendly ways, without damaging relationships. Moreover, this expectation\nmust be supported from the top down. If an employee is not going to be\nbacked up for challenging people regardless of their status, the normal\nreaction is to stop challenging--just the opposite of what you want.\n\nWHAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION KNOWS\n\nABOUT YOU\nWe like to think that government agencies with les on us keep the\ninformation safely locked away from people without an authentic need to\nknow. The reality is that even the federal government isn’t as immune to\npenetration as we would like to imagine.\nMay Linn(cid:146)s Phone Call\nPlace: A regional office of the Social Security Administration\nTime: 1 0:1 8 A.M., Thursday morning\n\"Mod Three. This is May Linn Wang.\"\nThe voice on the other end of the phone sounded apologetic, almost timid.\n\"Ms. Wang, this is Arthur Arondale, in the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral. Can I call you ’May’?\n\"It’s ’May Linn’,\" she said.\n\"Well, it’s like this, May Linn. We’ve got a new guy in here who there’s\nno computer for yet, and right now he’s got a priority project and he’s\nusing mine. We’re the government of the United States, for cryin’ out\nloud, and they say they don’t have enough money in the budget to buy a\ncomputer for this guy to use. And now my boss thinks I’m falling behind\nand doesn’t want to hear any excuses, you know?\"\n\"I know what you mean, all right.\"\n\"Can you help me with a quick inquiry on MCS?\" he asked, using the\nname of the computer system for looking up taxpayer information.\n\"Sure, what’cha need?\"\n\"The first thing I need you to do is an alphadent on Joseph Johnson, DOB\n7/4/69.\" (Alphadent means to have the computer search for an account\nalphabetically by taxpayer name, further identified by date of birth.)\nAfter a brief pause, she asked:\n\"What do you need to know?\"\n\"What’s his account number?\" he said, using the insider’s\nshorthand for the social security number. She read it off.\n\"Okay, I need you to do a numident on that account number,\"\nthe caller said.\nThat was a request for her to read off the basic taxpayer data,\nand May Linn responded by giving the taxpayer’s place of\nbirth, mother’s maiden name, and father’s name. The caller\nlistened patiently while she also gave him the month and year\nthe card was issued, and the district office it was issued by.\nHe next asked for a DEQY. (Pronounced \"DECK-wee,\" it’s short\nfor \"detailed earnings query.\")\nThe DEQY request brought the response, \"For what year?\"\nThe caller replied, \"Year 2001 .\"\nMay Linn said, \"The amount was $190,286, the payer was Johnson\nMicroTech.\"\n\"Any other wages?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Thanks,\" he said. \"You’ve been very kind.\"\nThen he tried to arrange to call her whenever he needed information and\ncouldn’t get to his computer, again using the favorite trick of social\nengineers of always trying to establish a connection so that he can keep\ngoing back to the same person, avoiding the nuisance of having to find a\nnew mark each\ntime.\n\"Not next week,\" she told him, because she was going to Kentucky for her\nsister’s wedding.’ Any other time, she’d do whatever she could.\nWhen she put the phone down, May Linn felt good that she\nhad been able to offer a little help to a fellow unappreciated\npublic servant.\nKeith Carter’s Story\nTo judge from the movies and from best-selling crime novels, a private\ninvestigator is short on ethics and long on knowledge of how to get the\njuicy facts on people. They do this by using thoroughly illegal methods,\nwhile just barely managing to avoid getting arrested. The truth, of course,\nis that most PIs run entirely legitimate businesses. Since many of them\nstarted their working lives as sworn law enforcement officers, they know\nperfectly well what’s legal and what isn’t, and most are not tempted to\ncross the line.\nThere are, however, exceptions. Some Pis - more than a few - do indeed\nfit the mold of the guys in the crime stories. These guys are known in the\ntrade as information brokers, a polite term for people who are willing to\nbreak the rules. They know they can get any assignment done a good deal\nfaster and a good deal easier if they take some shortcuts. That these\nshortcuts happen to be potential felonies that might land them behind bars\nfor a few years doesn’t seem to deter the more unscrupulous ones.\nMeanwhile the upscale PIs--the ones who work out of a fancy office suite\nin a high-rent part of town--don’t do this kind of work themselves. They\nsimply hire some information broker to do it for them.\nThe guy we’ll call Keith Carter was the kind of private eye unencumbered\nby ethics.\nIt was a typical case of \"Where’s he hiding the money?\" Or sometimes it’s\n\"Where’s she hiding the money?\" Sometimes it was a rich lady who\nwanted to know where her husband had hidden her money (though why a\nwoman with money ever marries a guy without was a riddle Keith Carter\nwondered about now and then but had never found a good answer for).\nIn this case the husband, whose name was Joe Johnson, was the one\nkeeping the money on ice. He \"was a very smart guy who had started a\nhigh-tech company with ten thousand dollars he borrowed from his wife’s\nfamily and built into a hundred-million dollar firm. According to her\ndivorce lawyer, he had done an impressive job of hiding his assets, and\nthe lawyer wanted a complete rundown.\nKeith figured his starting point would be the Social Security\nAdministration, targeting their files on Johnson, which would be packed\nwith highly useful information for a situation like this. Armed with their\ninfo, Keith could pretend to be the target and get the banks, brokerage\nfirms, and offshore institutions to tell him everything.\nHis first phone call was to a local district office, using the same 800\nnumber that any member of the public uses, the number listed in the local\nphone book. When a clerk came on the line, Keith asked to be connected\nto someone in Claims. Another wait, and then a voice. Now Keith shifted\ngears; \"Hi,\" he began. \"This is Gregory Adams, District Office 329.\nListen, I’m trying to reach a claims adjuster that handles an account\nnumber that ends in 6363, and the number I have goes to a fax machine.\"\n\"That’s Mod 2,\" the man said. He looked up the number and gave it to\nKeith.\nNext he called Mod 2. When May Linn answered, he switched hats and\nwent through the routine about being from the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral, and the problem about somebody else having to use his\ncomputer. She gave him the information he was looking for, and agreed to\ndo whatever she could when he needed help in the future.\nAnalyzing the Con\nWhat made this approach effective was the play on the employee’s\nsympathy with the story about someone else using his computer and \"my\nboss is not happy with me.\" People don’t show their emotions at work\nvery often; when they do, it can roll right over someone else’s ordinary\ndefenses against social engineering attacks. The emotional ploy of \"I’m in\ntrouble, won’t you help me?\" was all it took to win the day.\nSocial Insecurity\nIncredibly, the Social Security Administration has posted a copy of their\nentire Program Operations Manual on the Web, crammed with\ninformation that’s useful for their people, but also incredibly valuable to\nsocial engineers. It contains abbreviations, lingo, and instructions for how\nto request what you want, as described in this story.\nWant to learn more inside information about the Social Security\nAdministration? Just search on Google or enter the following address into\nyour browser: http://policy.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/. Unless the agency has\nalready read this story and removed the manual by the time you read this,\nyou’ll find on-line instructions that even give detailed information on what\ndata an SSA clerk is allowed to give to the law enforcement community.\nIn practical terms, that community includes any social engineer who can\nconvince an SSA clerk that he is from a law enforcement organization.\nThe attacker could not have been successful in obtaining this information\nfrom one of the clerks who handles phone calls from the general public.\nThe kind of attack Keith used only works when the person on the\nreceiving end of the call is someone whose phone number is unavailable\nto the public, and who therefore has the expectation that anyone calling\nmust be somebody on the inside--another example of speakeasy security’.\nThe elements that helped this attack to work included:\nKnowing the phone number to the Mod.\nKnowing the terminology they used--numident, alphadent, and DEQY.\nPretending to be from the Office of the Inspector General, which every\nfederal government employee knows as a government-wide investigative\nagency with broad powers. This gives the attacker an aura of authority.\nOne interesting sidelight: Social engineers seem to know how to make\nrequests so that hardly anyone ever thinks, \"Why are you calling me.’-\neven when, logically; it would have made more sense if the call had gone\nto some other person in some completely different department. Perhaps it\nsimply offers such a break in the monotony of the daily grind to help the\ncaller that the victim discounts how unusual the call seems.\nFinally, the attacker in this incident, not satisfied with getting the\ninformation just for the case at hand, wanted to establish a contact he\ncould call on regularly. He might otherwise have been able to use a\ncommon ploy for the sympathy attack--\"I spilled coffee on my keyboard.\"\nThat was no good here, though, because a keyboard can be replaced in a\nday.\nHence he used the story about somebody else using his computer, which\nhe could reasonably string out for weeks: \"Yep, I thought he’d have his\nown computer yesterday, but one came in and another guy pulled some\nkind of deal and got it instead. So this joker is still showing up in my\ncubicle.\" And so on.\nPoor me, I need help. Works like a charm.\n\nONE SIMPLE CALL\nOne of an attacker’s main hurdles is to make his request sound reasonable\nsomething typical of requests that come up in the victim’s workday,\nsomething that doesn’t put the victim out too much. As with a lot of other\nthings in life, making a request sound logical may be a challenge one day,\nbut the next, it may be a piece of cake.\nMary H’s Phone Call\nDate/Time: Monday, November 23, 7:49 A.M.\nPlace: Mauersby & Storch Accounting, New York\nTo most people, accounting work is number crunching and bean counting,\ngenerally viewed as being about as enjoyable as having a root canal.\nFortunately, not everyone sees the work that way. Mary Harris, for\nexample, found her work as a senior accountant absorbing, part of the\nreason she was one of the most dedicated accounting employees at her\nfirm.\nOn this particular Monday, Mary arrived early to get a head start on what\nshe expected to be a long day, and was surprised to find her phone\nringing. She picked it up and gave her name.\n\"Hi, this is Peter Sheppard. I’m with Arbuclde Support, the company that\ndoes tech support for your firm. We logged a couple of complaints over\nthe weekend from people having problems with the computers there. I\nthought I could troubleshoot before everybody comes into work this\nmorning. Are you having any problems with your computer or connecting\nto the network?\"\nShe told him she didn’t know yet. She turned her computer on and while it\nwas booting, he explained what he wanted to do.\n\"I’d like to run a couple of tests with you, he said. \"I’m able to see on my\nscreen the keystrokes you type, and I want to make sure they’re going\nacross the network correctly. So every time you type a stroke, I want you\nto tell me what it is, and I’ll see if the same letter or number is appearing\nhere. Okay?\"\nWith nightmare visions of her computer not working and a frustrating day\nof not being able to get any work done, she was more than happy to have\nthis man help her. After a few moments, she told him, \"I have the login\nscreen, and I’m going to type in my ID. I’m typing it now--\nM...A...R...Y...D.\"\n\"Great so far,\" he said. \"I’m seeing that here. Now, go ahead and type\nyour password but don’t tell me what it is. You should never tell anybody\nyour password, not even tech support. I’ll just see asterisks here--your\npassword is protected so I can’t see it.’: None of this was true, but it made\nsense to Mary. And then he said, \"Let me know once your computer has\nstarted up.\"\nWhen she said it was running, he had her open two of her applications,\nand she reported that they launched \"just fine.\"\nMary was relieved to see that everything seemed to be working normally.\nPeter said, \"I’m glad I could make sure you’ll be able to use your computer\nokay. And listen,\" he went on, \"we just installed an update that allow\npeople to change their passwords. Would you be willing to take a couple\nof minutes with me so I can see if we got it working right?\nShe was grateful for the help he had given her and readily agreed. Peter\ntalked her through the steps of launching the application that allows a user\nto change passwords, a standard element of the Windows 2000 operating\nsystem. \"Go ahead and enter your password,\" he told her. \"But remember\nnot to say it out loud.\"\nWhen she had done that, Peter said, \"Just for this quick test, when it asks\nfor your new password, enter ’test123.’ Then type it again in the\nVerification box, and click Enter.\"\nHe walked her through the process of disconnecting from the server. He\nhad her wait a couple of minutes, then connect again, this time trying to\nlog on with her new password. It worked like a charm, Peter seemed very\npleased, and talked her through changing back to her original password or\nchoosing a new one--once more cautioning her about not saying the\npassword out loud.\n\"Well, Mary,\" Peter told her. \"We didn’t find any trouble, and that’s great.\nListen, if any problems do come up, just call us over here at Arbuckle. I’m\nusually on special projects but anybody here who answers can help you.\"\nShe thanked him and they said goodbye.\nPeter’s Story\nThe word had gotten around about Peter--a number of the people in his\ncommunity who had gone to school with him had heard he turned into\nsome kind of a computer whiz who could often find out useful\ninformation that other people couldn’t get. When Alice Conrad came to\nhim to ask a favor, he said no at first. Why should he help? When he ran\ninto her once and tried to ask for a date, she had turned him down cold.\nBut his refusal to help didn’t seem to surprise her. She said she didn’t think\nit was something he could do anyway. That was like a challenge, because\nof course he was sure he could. And that was how he came to\nagree.\nAlice had been offered a contract for some consulting work for a\nmarketing company, but the contract terms didn’t seem very good. Before\nshe went back to ask for a better deal, she wanted to know what terms\nother consultants had on their contracts.\nThis is how Peter tells the story.\nI wouldn’t tell Alice but I got off on people wanting me to do something\nthey didn’t think I could, when I knew it would be easy. Well, not easy,\nexactly, not this time. It would take a bit of doing. But that was okay.\nI could show her what smart was really all about.\nA little after 7:30 Monday morning, I called the marketing company’s\noffices and got the receptionist, said that I was with the company that\nhandled their pension plans and I need to talk to somebody in Accounting.\nHad she noticed if any of the Accounting people had come in yet? She\nsaid, \"I think I saw Mary come in a few minutes ago, I’ll try her for you.\"\nWhen Mary picked up the phone, I told her my little story about computer\nproblems, which was designed to give her the jitters so she’d be glad to\ncooperate. As soon as I had talked her through changing her password, I\nthen quickly logged onto the system with the same temporary password I\nhad asked her to use, test123.\nHere’s where the mastery comes in--I installed a small program that\nallowed me to access the company’s computer system whenever I wanted,\nusing a secret password of my own. After I hung up with Mary, my first\nstep was to erase the audit trail so no one would even know I had been on\nhis or her system. It was easy. After elevating my system privileges, I was\nable to download a free program called clearlogs that I found on a\nsecurity- related Web site at www.ntsecurity.nu.\nTime for the real job. I ran a search for any documents with the word\ncontract\" in the filename, and downloaded the files. Then I searched some\nmore and came on the mother lode--the directory containing all the\nconsultant payment reports. So I put together all the contract files and a\nlist of payments.\nAlice could pore through the contracts and see how much they were\npaying other consultants. Let her do the donkeywork of poring through all\nthose files. I had done what she asked me to.\nFrom the disks I put the data onto, I printed out some of the files so I\ncould show her the evidence. I made her meet me and buy dinner. You\nshould have seen her face when she thumbed through the stack of papers.\n\"No way,\" she said. \"No way.\"\nI didn’t bring the disks with me. They were the bait. I said she’d have to\ncome over to get them, hoping maybe she’d want to show her gratitude for\nthe favor I just did her.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nIt’s amazing how easy it is for a social engineer to get people to do things\nbased on how he structures the request. The premise is to trigger an\nautomatic response based on psychological principles, and rely on the\nmental shortcuts people take when they perceive the caller as an ally.\nAnalyzing the Con\nPeter’s phone call to the marketing company represented the most basic\nform of social engineering--a simple attempt that needed little preparation,\nworked on the first attempt, and took only a few minutes to bring off.\nEven better, Mary, the victim, had no reason to think that any sort of trick\nor ruse had been played on her, no reason to file a report or raise a ruckus.\nThe scheme worked through Peter’s use of three social engineering tactics.\nFirst he got Mary’s initial cooperation by generating fear--making her\nthink that her computer might not be usable. Then he took the time to\nhave her open two of her applications so she could be sure they were\nworking okay, strengthening the rapport between the two of them, a sense\nof being allies. Finally, he got her further cooperation for the essential part\nof his task by playing on her gratitude for the help he had provided in\nmaking sure her computer was okay.\nBy telling her she shouldn’t ever reveal her password, should not reveal it\neven to him, Peter did a thorough but subtle job of convincing her that he\nwas concerned about the security of her company’s files. This boosted her\nconfidence that he must be legitimate because he was protecting her and\nthe company.\n\nTHE POLICE RAID\nPicture this scene: The government has been trying to lay a trap for a man\nnamed Arturo Sanchez, who has been distributing movies free over the\nInternet. The Hollywood studios say he’s violating their copyrights, he\nsays he’s just trying to nudge them to recognize an inevitable market so\nthey’ll start doing something about making new movies available for\ndownload. He points out (correctly) that this could be a huge source of\nrevenue for the studios that they seem to be completely ignoring.\nSearch Warrant, Please\nComing home late one night, he checks the windows of his apartment\nfrom across the street and notices the lights are off, even though he always\nleaves one on when he goes out.\nHe pounds and bangs on a neighbor’s door until he wakes the man up, and\nlearns that there was indeed a police raid in the building. But they made\nthe neighbors stay downstairs, and he still isn’t sure what apartment they\nwent into. He only knows they left carrying some heavy things, only they\nwere wrapped up and he couldn’t tell what they were. And they didn’t take\nanybody away in handcuffs.\nArturo checks his apartment. The bad news is that there’s a paper from\nthe police requiring that he call immediately and set up an appointment\nfor an interview within three days. The worse news is that his computers\nare missing.\nArturo vanishes into the night, going to stay with a friend. But the\nuncertainty gnaws at him. How much do the police know? Have they\ncaught up with him at last, but left him a chance to flee? Or is this about\nsomething else entirely, something he can clear up without having to\nleave town?\nBefore you read on, stop and think for a moment: Can you imagine any\nway you could find out what the police know about you? Assuming you\ndon’t have any political contacts or friends in the police department or the\nprosecutor s office, do you imagine there’s any way that you, as an\nordinary citizen, could get this information? Or that even someone with\nsocial engineering skills could?\nScamming the Police\nArturo satisfied his need to know like this: To start with, he got the phone\nnumber for a nearby copy store, called them, and asked for their fax\nnumber.\nThen he called the district attorney’s office, and asked for Records. When\nhe was connected with the records office, he introduced himself as an\ninvestigator with Lake County, and said he needed to speak with the clerk\nwho files the active search warrants.\n\"I do,\" the lady said. \"Oh, great,\" he answered. \"Because we raided a\nsuspect last night and I’m trying to locate the affidavit.\"\n\"We file them by address,\" she told him.\nHe gave his address, and she sounded almost excited. \"Oh, yeah,\" she\nbubbled, \"I know about that one. ’The Copyright Caper.’\"\n\"That’s the one,\" he said. \"I’m looking for the affidavit and copy of the\nwarrant.\n\"Oh, I have it right here.\"\n\"Great,\" he said. \"Listen, I’m out in the field and I have a meeting with the\nSecret Service on this case if I fifteen minutes. I’ve been so absentminded\nlately, I left the file at home, and I’ll never make it there and back in time.\nCould I get copies from you?\"\n\"Sure, no problem. I’ll make copies; you can come right over and pick\nthem up.\"\n\"Great,\" he said. \"That’s great. But listen, I’m on the other side of town. Is\nit possible you could fax them to me?\"\nThat created a small problem, but not insurmountable. \"We don’t have a\nfax up here in Records,\" she said. \"But they have one downstairs in the\nClerk’s office they might let me use.\"\nHe said, \"Let me call the Clerk’s office and set it up.\"\nThe lady in the Clerk’s office said she’d be glad to take care of it but\nwanted to know \"Who’s going to pay for it?\" She needed an accounting\ncode.\n\"I’ll get the code and call you back,\" he told her.\nHe then called the DA’s office, again identified himself as a police officer\nand simply asked the receptionist, \"What’s the accounting code for the\nDA’s office?\" Without hesitation, she told him.\nCalling back to the Clerk’s office to provide the accounting number gave\nhim the excuse for manipulating the lady a little further: He talked her\ninto walking upstairs to get the copies of the papers to be faxed.\n\nNOTE\nHow does a social engineer know the details of so many operation (cid:150)\npolice departments, prosecutors offices, phone company practices, the\norganization of specific companies that are in fields useful in his attacks,\nsuch as telecommunications and computers ? Because it(cid:146)s his business to\nfind out. This knowledge is a social engineers stock in the trade because\ninformation can aid him in his efforts to deceive.\nCovering His Tracks\nArturo still had another couple of steps to take. There was always a\npossibility that someone would smell something fishy, and he might\narrive at the copy store to find a couple of detectives, casually dressed and\ntrying to\nlook busy until somebody showed up asking for that particular fax. He\nwaited a while, and then called the Clerk’s office back to verify that the\nlady had sent the fax. Fine so far.\nHe called another copy store in the same chain across town and used the\nruse about how he was \"pleased with your handling of a job and want to\nwrite the manager a letter of congratulations, what’s her name?\" With that\nessential piece of information, he called the first copy store again and said\nhe wanted to talk to the manager. When the man picked up the phone,\nArturo said, \"Hi, this is Edward at store 628 in Hartfield. My manager,\nAnna, told me to call you. We’ve got a customer who’s all upset--\nsomebody gave him the fax number of the wrong store. He’s here waiting\nfor an important fax, only the number he was given is for your store.\" The\nmanager promised to have one of his people locate the fax and send it on\nto the Hartfield store immediately.\nArturo was already waiting at the second store when the fax arrived there.\nOnce he had it in hand, he called back to the Clerk’s office to tell the lady\nthanks, and ’It’s not necessary to bring those copies back upstairs, you can\njust throw them away now.\" Then he called the manager at the first store\nand told him, too, to throw away their copy of the fax. This way there\nwouldn’t be any record of what had taken place, just in case somebody\nlater came around asking questions. Social engineers know you can never\nbe too careful.\nArranged this way, Arturo didn’t even have to pay charges at the first\ncopy store for receiving the fax and for sending it out again to the second\nstore. And if it turned out that the police did show up at the first store,\nArturo would already have his fax and be long gone by the time they\ncould arrange to get people to the second location.\nThe end of the story: The affidavit and warrant showed that the police had\nwell-documented evidence of Arturo’s movie-copying activities. That was\nwhat he needed to know. By midnight, he had crossed the state line.\nArturo was on the way to a new life, somewhere else with a new identity,\nready to get started again on his campaign.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThe people who work in any district attorney’s office, anywhere, are in\nconstant contact with law enforcement officers--answering questions,\nmaking arrangements, taking messages. Anybody gutsy enough to call\nand claim to be a police officer, sheriff’s deputy, or whatever will likely\nbe taken at his word. Unless it’s obvious that he doesn’t know the\nterminology, or if he’s nervous and stumbles over his words, or in some\nother way\ndoesn’t sound authentic, he may not even be asked a single question to\nverify his claim. That’s exactly what happened here, with two different\nworkers.",
    "question": "What are some common tactics used by social engineers to trick people into revealing confidential information or visiting fake websites?",
    "summary": "Chapter 7 discusses how free offers in emails can be used by attackers to trick users into downloading malicious software, such as viruses or Remote Access Trojans (RATs), which can compromise their systems. It highlights the use of social engineering to exploit users' desire for free gifts, often through deceptive emails that mimic trusted sources. Chapter 8 explains how social engineers use sympathy, guilt, and intimidation to manipulate people into revealing sensitive information, as seen in examples involving the Social Security Administration and a marketing company. Both chapters emphasize the importance of vigilance and proper security measures to avoid falling victim to these tactics."

    "text": "MITNICK MESSAGE\nThe truth of the matter is that no one is immune to being duped by a good\nsocial engineer. Because of the pace of normal life, we don’t always take\nthe time for thoughtful decisions, even on matters that are important to us.\nComplicated situations, lack of time, emotional state, or mental fatigue\ncan easily distract us. So we take a mental shortcut, making our decisions\nwithout analyzing the information carefully and completely, a mental\nprocess known as automatic responding. This is even true for federal,\nstate, and local law enforcement officials. We’re all human.\nObtaining a needed charge code was handled with a single phone call.\nThen Arturo played the sympathy card with the story about \"a meeting\nwith the Secret Service in fifteen minutes, I’ve been absent-minded and\nleft the file at home.\" She naturally felt sorry for him, and went out of her\nway to help.\nThen by using not one but two copy stores, Arturo made himself extra\nsafe when he went to pick up the fax. A variation on this that makes the\nfax even more difficult to trace: Instead of having the document sent to\nanother copy store, the attacker can give what appears to be a fax number,\nbut is really an address at a free Internet service that will receive a fax for\nyou and automatically forward it to your email address. That way it can be\ndownloaded directly to the attacker’s computer, and he never has to show\nhis face anyplace where someone might later be able to identify him. And\nthe email address and electronic fax number can be abandoned as soon as\nthe mission has been accomplished.\n\nTURNING THE TABLES\nA young man I’ll call Michael Parker was one of those people who figured\nout a bit late that the better-paying jobs mostly go to people with college\ndegrees. He had a chance to attend a local college on a partial scholarship\nplus education loans, but it meant working nights and weekends to pay his\nrent, food, gas, and car insurance. Michael, who always liked to find\nshortcuts, thought maybe there was another way, one that paid off faster\nand with less effort. Because he had been learning about computers from\nthe time he got to play with one at age ten and became fascinated with\nfinding out how they worked, he decided to see if he could \"create\" his\nown accelerated bachelor’s degree in computer science.\nGraduating--Without Honors\nHe could have broken into the computer systems of the state university,\nfound the record of someone who had graduated with a nice B+ or A-\naverage, copied the record, put his own name on it, and added it to the\nrecords of that year’s graduating class. Thinking this through, feeling\nsomehow uneasy about the idea, he realized there must be other records of\na student having been on campus--tuition payment records, the housing\noffice, and who knows what else. Creating just the record of courses and\ngrades would leave too many loopholes.\nPlotting further, feeling his way, it came to him that he could reach his\ngoal by seeing if the school had a graduate with the same name as his,\nwho had earned a computer science degree any time during an appropriate\nspan of years. If so, he could just put down the other Michael Parker’s\nsocial security number on employment application forms; any company\nthat checked the name and social security number with the university\nwould be told that, yes, he did have the claimed degree. (It wouldn’t be\nobvious to most people but was obvious to him that he could put one\nsocial security number on the job application and then, if hired, put his\nown real number on the new-employee forms. Most companies would\nnever think to check whether a new hire had used a different number\nearlier in the hiring process.)\nLogging In to Trouble\nHow to find a Michael Parker in the university’s records? He went about it\nlike this:\nGoing to the main library on the university campus, he sat down at a\ncomputer terminal, got up on the Internet, and accessed the university’s\nWeb site. He then called the Registrar’s office. With the person who\nanswered, he went through one of the by-now-familiar social engineering\nroutines: \"I’m calling from the Computer Center, we’re making some\nchanges to the network configuration and we want to make sure we don’t\ndisrupt your access. Which server do you connect to?\"\n\"What do you mean, server, he was asked.\n\"What computer do you connect to when you need to look up student\nacademic information.\nThe answer, admin.rnu.edu, gave him the name of the computer where\nstudent records were stored. This was the first piece of the puzzle: He now\nknew his target machine.\n\nLINGO\nDUMB TERMINAL A terminal that doesn(cid:146)t contain its own\nmicroprocessor. Dumb terminals can only accept simple commands and\ndisplay text characters and numbers.\nHe typed that URL into the computer and got no response--as expected,\nthere was a firewall blocking access. So he ran a program to see if he\ncould connect to any of the services running on that computer, and found\nan open port with a Telnet service running, which allows one computer to\nconnect remotely to another computer and access it as if directly\nconnected using a dumb terminal. All he would need to gain access would\nbe the standard user ID and password.\nHe made another call to the registrar’s office, this time listening carefully\nto make sure he was talking to a different person. He got a lady, and again\nhe claimed to be from the university’s Computer Center. They were\ninstalling a new production system for administrative records, he told her.\nAs a favor, he’d like her to connect to the new system, still in test mode, to\nsee if she could access student academic records okay. He gave her the IP\naddress to connect to, and talked her through the process.\nIn fact, the IP address took her to the computer Michael was sitting at in\nthe campus library. Using the same process described in Chapter 8, he had\ncreated a login simulator--a decoy sign-in screen--looking just like the one\nshe was accustomed to seeing when going onto the system for student\nrecords. \"It’s not working,\" she told him. \"It keeps saying ’Login incorrect.\nBy now the login simulator had fed the keystrokes of her account name\nand password to Michael’s terminal; mission accomplished. He told her,\n\"Oh, some of the accounts haven’t been brought over yet to this machine.\nLet me set up your account, and I’ll call you back.\" Careful about tying up\nloose ends, as any proficient social engineer needs to be, he would make a\npoint of phoning later to say that the test system wasn’t working right yet,\nand if it was okay with her, they’d call back to her or one of the other\nfolks there when they had figured out what was causing the problem.\nThe Helpful Registrar\nNow Michael knew what computer system he needed to access, and he\nhad a user’s ID and password. But what commands would he need in\norder to search the files for information on a computer science graduate\nwith the right name and graduation date? The student database would be a\nproprietary one, created on campus to meet the specific requirements of\nthe university and the Registrar’s office, and would have a unique way of\naccessing information in the database.\nFirst step in clearing this last hurdle: Find out who could guide him\nthrough the mysteries of searching the student database. He called the\nRegistrar’s office again, this time reaching a different person. He was\nfrom the office of the Dean of Engineering, he told the lady, and he asked,\n\"Who are we supposed to call for help when we’re having problems\naccessing the student academic rues.\nMinutes later he was on the phone with the college’s database\nadministrator, pulling the sympathy act: \"I’m Mark Sellers, in the\nregistrar’s office. You feel like taking pity on a new guy? Sorry to be\ncalling you but they’re all in a meeting this afternoon and there’s no one\naround to help me. I need to retrieve a list of all graduates with a\ncomputer science degree, between 1990 and 2000. They need it by the end\nof the day and if I don’t have it, I may not have this job for long. You\nwilling to help out a guy in trouble?\" Helping people out was part of what\nthis database administrator did, so he was extra patient as he talked\nMichael step by step through the process.\nBy the time they hung up, Michael had downloaded the entire list of\ncomputer science graduates for those years. Within a few minutes he had\nrun a search, located two Michael Parkers, chosen one of them, and\nobtained the guy’s social security number as well as other pertinent\ninformation stored in the database.\nHe had just become \"Michael Parker, B.S. in Computer Science,\ngraduated with honors, 1998.\" In this case, the \"B.S.\" was uniquely\nappropriate.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThis attack used one ruse I haven’t talked about before: The attacker\nasking the organization’s database administrator to walk him through the\nsteps of carrying out a computer process he didn’t know how to do. A\npowerful and effective turning of the tables, this is the equivalent of\nasking the owner of a store to help you carry a box containing items\nyou’ve just stolen from his shelves out to your car.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nComputer users are sometimes clueless about the threats and\nvulnerabilities associated with social engineering that exist in our world of\ntechnology. They have access to information, yet lack the detailed\nknowledge of what might prove to be a security threat. A social engineer\nwill target an employee who has little understanding of how valuable the\ninformation being sought is, so the target is more likely to grant the\nstranger’s request.\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nSympathy, guilt, and intimidation are three very popular psychological\ntriggers used by the social engineer, and these stories have demonstrated\nthe tactics in action. But what can you and your company do to avoid\nthese types of attacks?\nProtecting Data\nSome stories in this chapter emphasize the danger of sending a file to\nsomeone you don’t know, even when that person is (or appears to be) an\nemployee, and the file is being sent internally, to an email address or tax\nmachine within the company.\nCompany security policy needs to be very specific about the safeguards\nfor surrendering valued data to anyone not personally known to the\nsender. Exacting procedures need to be established for transferring files\nwith sensitive information. When the request is from someone not\npersonally known, there must be clear steps to take for verification, with\ndifferent levels of authentication depending on the sensitivity of the\ninformation.\nHere are some techniques to consider:\nEstablish the need to know (which may require obtaining authorization\nfrom the designated information owner).\nKeep a personal or departmental log of these transactions.\nMaintain a list of people who have been specially trained in the\nprocedures and who are trusted to authorize sending out sensitive\ninformation. Require that only these people be allowed to send\ninformation to anyone outside the workgroup.\nIf a request for the data is made in writing (email, fax, or mail) take\nadditional security steps to verify that the request actually came from the\nperson it appears to have come from.\nAbout Passwords\nAll employees who are able to access any sensitive information--and\ntoday that means virtually every worker who uses a computer--need to\nunderstand that simple acts like changing your password, even for a few\nmoments, can lead to a major security breach.\nSecurity training needs to cover the topic of passwords, and that has to\nfocus in part on when and how to change your password, what constitutes\nan acceptable password, and the hazards of letting anyone else become\ninvolved in the process. The training especially needs to convey to all\nemployees that they should be suspicious of any request that involves\ntheir passwords.\nOn the surface this appears to be a simple message to get across to\nemployees. It’s not, because to appreciate this idea requires that\nemployees grasp how a simple act like changing a password can lead to a\nsecurity compromise. You can tell a child \"Look both ways before\ncrossing the street,\" but until the child understands why that’s important,\nyou’re relying on blind obedience. And rules requiring blind obedience are\ntypically ignored or forgotten.\n\nNOTE\nPasswords are such a central focus of social engineering attacks that we\ndevote a separate section to the topic in Chapter 16, where you will find\nspecific recommended policies on managing passwords.\nA Central Reporting Point\nYour security policy should provide a person or group designated as a\ncentral point for reporting suspicious activities that appear to be attempts\nto infiltrate your organization. All employees need to know who to call\nany time they suspect an attempt at electronic or physical intrusion. The\nphone number of the place to make these reports should always be close\nat hand so employees don’t have to dig for it if they become suspicious\nthat an attack is taking place.\nProtect Your Network\nEmployees need to understand that the name of a computer server or\nnetwork is not trivial information, but rather it can give an attacker\nessential knowledge that helps him gain trust or find the location of the\ninformation he desires.\nIn particular, people such as database administrators who work with\nsoftware belong to that category of those with technology expertise, and\nthey need to operate under special and very restrictive rules about\nverifying the identity of people who call them for information or advice.\nPeople who regularly provide any. kind of computer help need to be well\ntrained in what kinds of requests should be red flags, suggesting that the\ncaller may be attempting a social engineering attack.\nIt’s worth noting, though, that from the perspective of the database\nadministrator in the last story in this chapter, the caller met the criteria for\nbeing legitimate: He was calling from on campus, and he was obviously\non a site that required an account name and password. This just makes\nclear once again the importance of having standardized procedures for\nverifying the identity of anybody requesting information, especially in a\ncase like this where the caller was asking for help in obtaining access to\nconfidential records.\nAll of this advice goes double for colleges and universities. It’s not news\nthat computer hacking is a favorite pastime for many college students, and\nit should also be no surprise that student records--and sometimes faculty\nrecords, as well--are a tempting target. This abuse is so rampant that some\ncorporations actually consider campuses a hostile environment, and create\nfirewall rules that block access from educational institutions with\naddresses that end in .edu.\nThe long and short of it is that all student and personnel records of any\nkind should be seen as prime targets of attack, and should be well\nprotected as sensitive information.\nTraining Tips\nMost social engineering attacks are ridiculously easy to defend against...\nfor anyone who knows what to be on the lookout for.\nFrom the corporate perspective, there is a fundamental need for good\ntraining. But there is also a need for something else: a variety of ways to\nremind people of what they’ve learned.\nUse splash screens that appear when the user’s computer is turned on, with\na different security message each day. The message should be designed so\nthat it does not disappear automatically, but requires the user to click on\nsome kind of acknowledgement that he/she has read it.\nAnother approach I recommend is to start a series of security reminders.\nFrequent reminder messages are important; an awareness program needs\nto be ongoing and never-ending. In delivering content, the reminders\nshould not be worded the same in every instance. Studies have shown that\nthese messages are more effectively received when they vary in wording\nor when used in different examples.\nOne excellent approach is to use short blurbs in the company newsletter.\nThis should not be a full column on the subject, although a security\ncolumn would certainly be valuable. Instead, design a two- or three-\ncolumn-wide insert, something like a small display ad in your local\nnewspaper. In each issue of the newsletter, present a new security\nreminder in this short, attention-catching way.\n\nChapter 9\nThe Reverse Sting\nThe sting, mentioned elsewhere in this book (and in my opinion probably\nthe best movie that s ever been made about a con operation), lays out its\ntricky plot in fascinating detail. The sting operation\nin the movie is an exact depiction of how top grifters run \"the wire,\" one\nof the three types of major swindles referred to as \"big cons.\" If you want\nto know how a team of professionals pulls off a scam raking in a great\ndeal of money in a single evening, there’s no better textbook.\nBut traditional cons, whatever their particular gimmick, run according\nto a pattern. Sometimes a ruse is worked in the opposite direction, which\nis called a reverse sting. This is an intriguing twist in which the attacker\nsets up the situation so that the victim calls on the attacker for help, or a\nco worker has made a request, which the attacker is responding to.\nHow does this work? You’re about to find out.\n\nLINGO\nREVERSE STING A con in which the person being attacked asks the\nattacker for help\n\nTHE ART OF FRIENDLY PERSUASION\nWhen the average person conjures up the picture of a computer hacker,\nwhat usually comes to mind is the uncomplimentary image of a lonely,\nintroverted nerd whose best friend is his computer and who has difficulty\ncarrying on a conversation, except by instant messaging. The social\nengineer, who often has hacker skills, also has people skills at the\nopposite end\nof the spectrum--well-developed abilities to use and manipulate people\nthat allow him to talk his way into getting information in ways you would\nnever have believed possible. Angela’s Caller\nPlace: Valley branch, Industrial Federal Bank. Time: 11:27 A.M. Angela Wisnowski answered a phone call from a man who said he was\njust about to receive a sizeable inheritance and he wanted information on\nthe different types of savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and\nwhatever other investments she might be able to suggest that would be\nsafe, but earn decent interest. She explained there were quite a number of\nchoices and asked if he’d like to come in and sit down with her to discuss\nthem. He was leaving on a trip as soon as the money arrived, he said, and\nhad a lot of arrangements to make. So she began suggesting some of the\npossibilities and giving him details of the interest rates, what happens if\nyou sell a CD early, and so on, while trying to pin down his investment\ngoals. She seemed to be making progress when he said, \"Oh, sorry, I’ve got to\ntake this other call. What time can I finish this conversation with you so I\ncan make some decisions? When do you leave for lunch?\" She told him\n12:30 and he said he’d try to call back before then or the following day. Louis(cid:146)s Caller\nMajor banks use internal security codes that change every day. When\nsomebody from one branch needs information from another branch, he\nproves he’s entitled to the information by demonstrating he knows the\nday’s code. For an added degree of security and flexibility, some major\nbanks issue multiple codes each day. At a West Coast outfit I’ll call\nIndustrial Federal Bank, each employee finds a list of five codes for the\nday, identified as A through E, on his or her computer each morning. Place: Same. Time: 12:48 ’.M., same day. Louis Halpburn didn’t think anything of it when a call came in that\nafternoon, a call like others he handled regularly several times a week. ’Hello,\" the caller said. \"This is Neil Webster. I’m calling from branch\n3182 in Boston. Angela Wisnowski, please.\"\n\"She’s at lunch. Can I help?\"\n\"Well, she left a message asking us to fax some information on one of our\ncustomers.\"\nThe caller sounded like he had been having a bad day. \"The person who normally handles those requests is out sick,\" he said. \"I’ve got a stack of these to do, it’s almost 4 o’clock here and I’m supposed\nto be out of this place to go to a doctor’s appointment in half an hour.\"\nThe manipulation--giving all the reasons why the other person should feel\nsorry for him--was part of softening up the mark. He went on, \"Whoever\ntook her phone message, the fax number is unreadable. It’s 213-\nsomething. What’s the rest?\"\nLouis gave the fax number, and the caller said, \"Okay, thanks. Before I can fax this, I need to ask you for Code B.\"\n\"But you called me,\" he said with just enough chill so the man from\nBoston would get the message. This is good, the caller thought. It’s so cool when people don’t fall over at\nthe first gentle shove. If the, don’t resist a little, the job is too easy and I\ncould start getting lazy. To Louis, he said, \"I’ve got a branch manager that’s just turned paranoid\nabout getting verification before we send anything out, is all. But listen, if\nyou don’t need us to fax the information, it’s okay. No need to verify.\"\n\"Look,\" Louis said, \"Angela will be back in half an hour or so. I can have\nher call you back.\"\n\"I’ll just tell her I couldn’t send the information today because you\nwouldn’t identify this as a legitimate request by giving me the code. If\nI’m not out sick tomorrow, I’ll call her back then.\"\n\"The message says ’Urgent.’ Never mind, without verification my hands\nare tied. You’ll tell her I tried to send it but you wouldn’t give the code,\nokay?\"\nLouis gave up under the pressure. An audible sigh of annoyance\ncame winging its way down the phone line. \"Well,\" he said, \"wait a minute; I have to go to my computer. Which code did you want?\"\n\"B,\" the caller said. He put the call on hold and then in a bit picked up the line again. \"It’s\n3184.\"\n\"That’s not the right code.\"\n\"Yes it is--B is 3184.\"\n\"I didn’t say B, I said E.\"\n\"Oh, damn. Wait a minute.\"\nAnother pause while he again looked up the codes. \"E is 9697.\"\n\"9697--right. I’ll have the fax on the way. Okay?\"\n\"Sure. Thanks.\"\nWalter(cid:146)s Call\n\"Industrial Federal Bank, this is Walter.\"\n\"Hey, Walter, it’s Bob Grabowski in Studio City, branch 38,\" the caller\nsaid. \"I need you to pull a sig card on a customer account and fax it to\nme.\" The sig card, or signature card, has more than just the customer’s\nsignature on it; it also has identifying information, familiar items such as\nthe social security number, date of birth, mother’s maiden name, and\nsometimes even a driver’s license number. Very handy to a social\nengineer. \"Sure thing. What’s Code C?\"\n\"Another teller is using my computer right now,\" the caller said. \"But I\njust used B and E, and I remember those. Ask me one of those.\"\n\"Okay, what’s E?\"\n\"E is 9697.\"\nA few minutes later, Walter faxed the sig card as requested. Donna Plaice(cid:146)s Call\n\"Hi, this is Mr. Anselmo.\"\n\"How can I help you today?\"\n\"What’s that 800 number I’m supposed to call when I want to see if a\ndeposit has been credited yet?\"\n\"You’re a customer of the bank?\"\n\"Yes, and I haven’t used the number in a while and now I don’t know\nwhere I wrote it down.\"\n\"The number is 800-555-8600.\"\n\"Okay, thanks.\"\nVince Capelli’s Tale\nThe son of a Spokane street cop, Vince knew from an early age that he\nwasn’t going to spend his life slaving long hours and risking his neck for\nminimum wage. His two main goals in life became getting out of\nSpokane, and going into business for himself. The laughter of his homies\nall through high school only fired him up all the more--they thought it was\nhilarious that he was so busted on starting his own business but had no\nidea what business it might be. Secretly Vince knew they were right. The only thing he was good at was\nplaying catcher on the high school baseball team. But not good enough to\ncapture a college scholarship, no way good enough for professional\nbaseball. So what business was he going to be able to start? One thing the guys in Vince’s group never quite figured out: Anything\none of them had---a new switchblade knife, a nifty pair of warm gloves, a\nsexy new girlfriend if Vince admired it, before long the item was his. He\ndidn’t steal it, or sneak behind anybody’s back; he didn’t have to. The guy\nwho had it would give it up willingly, and then wonder afterward how it\nhad happened. Even asking Vince wouldn’t have gotten you anywhere: He\ndidn’t know himself. People just seemed to let him have whatever he\nwanted. Vince Capelli was a social engineer from an early age, even though he\nhad never heard the term. His friends stopped laughing once they all had high school diplomas in\nhand. While the others slogged around town looking for jobs where you\ndidn’t have to say \"Do you want fries with that?\" Vince’s dad sent him off\nto talk to an old cop pal who had left the force to start his own private\ninvestigation business in San Francisco. He quickly spotted Vince’s talent\nfor the work, and took him on. That was six years ago. He hated the part about getting the goods on\nunfaithful spouses, which involved achingly dull hours of sitting and\nwatching, but felt continually challenged by assignments to dig up asset\ninformation for attorneys trying to figure out if some miserable stiff was\nrich enough to be worth suing. These assignments gave him plenty of\nchances to use his wits. Like the time he had to look into the bank accounts of a guy named Joe\nMarkowitz. Joe had maybe worked a shady deal on a one-time friend of\nhis, which friend now wanted to know, if he sued, was Markowitz flush\nenough that the friend might get some of his money back? Vince’s first step would be to find out at least one, but preferably two, of\nthe bank’s security codes for the day. That sounds like a nearly impossible\nchallenge: What on earth would induce a bank employee to knock a chink\nin his own security system? Ask yourself--if you wanted to do this, would\nyou have any idea of how to go about it? For people like Vince, it’s too easy. People trust you if you know the inside lingo of their job and their\ncompany. It’s like showing you belong to their inner circle. It’s like a\nsecret handshake. I didn’t need much of that for a job like this. Definitely not brain surgery. All’s I needed to get started was a branch number. When I dialed the\nBeacon Street office in Buffalo, the guy that answered sounded like a\nteller. \"This is Tim Ackerman,\" I said. Any name would do, he wasn’t going to\nwrite it down. \"What’s the branch number there?\"\n\"The phone number or the branch number, he wanted to know, which\nwas pretty stupid because I had just dialed the phone number, hadn’t I? \"Branch number.\"\n\"3182,\" he said. Just like that. No, \"Whad’ya wanna know for?\" or\nanything. ’Cause it’s not sensitive information, it’s written on just about\nevery piece of paper they use. Step Two, call the branch where my target did his banking, get the name\nof one of their people, and find out when the person would be out for\nlunch. Angela. Leaves at 12:30. So far, so good. Step Three, call back to the same branch during Angela’s lunch break, say\nI’m calling from branch number such-and-such in Boston, Angela needs\nthis information faxed, gimme a code for the day. This is the tricky part;\nit’s where the rubber meets the road. If I was making up a test to be a\nsocial engineer, I’d put something like this on it, where your victim gets\nsuspicious--for good reason--and you still stick in there until you break\nhim down and get the information you need. You can’t do that by reciting\nlines from a script or learning a routine, you got to be able to read your\nvictim, catch his mood, play him like landing a fish where you let out a\nlittle line and reel in, let out and reel in. Until you get him in the net and\nflop him into the boat, splat! So I landed him and had one of the codes for the day. A big step. With\nmost banks, one is all they use, so I would’ve been home flee. Industrial\nFederal Bank uses five, so having just one out of five is long odds. With\ntwo out of five, I’d have a much better chance of getting through the next\nact of this little drama. I love that part about \"I didn’t say B, I said E.\"\nWhen it works, it’s beautiful. And it works most of the time. Getting a third one would have been even better. I’ve actually managed to\nget three on a single call--\"B,\" \"D,\" and \"E\" sound so much alike that you\ncan claim they misunderstood you again. But you have to be talking to\nsomebody who’s a real pushover. This man wasn’t. I’d go with two. The day codes would be my trump to get the signature card. I call, and the\nguy asks for a code. C he wants, and I’ve only got B and E. But it’s not the\nend of the world. You gotta stay cool at a moment like this, sound\nconfident, keep right on going, Real smooth, I played him with the one\nabout, \"Somebody’s using my computer, ask me one of these others.\"\nWe’re all employees of the same company, we’re all in this together, make\nit easy on the guy--that’s what you’re hoping the victim is thinking at a\nmoment like this. And he played it right by the script. He took one of the\nchoices I offered, I gave him the right answer, he sent the fax of the sig\ncard. Almost home. One more call gave me the 800 number that customers use\nfor the automated service where an electronic voice reads you off the\ninformation you ask for.\n\nFrom the sig card, I had all of my target’s\naccount numbers and his PIN number, because that bank used the first\nfive or last four digits of the social security number. Pen in hand, I called\nthe 800 number and after a few minutes of pushing buttons, I had the\nlatest balance in all four of the guy’s accounts, and just for good measure,\nhis most recent deposits and withdrawals in each. Everything my client had asked for and more. I always like to give a little\nextra for good measure. Keep the clients happy. After all, repeat business\nis what keeps an operation going, right? Analyzing the Con\nThe key to this entire episode was obtaining the all-important day codes,\nand to do that the attacker, Vince, used several different techniques. He began with a little verbal arm-twisting when Louis proved reluctant to\ngive him a code. Louis was right to be suspicious--the codes are designed\nto be used in the opposite direction. He knew that in the usual flow of\nthings, the unknown caller would be giving him a security code. This was\nthe critical moment for Vince, he hinge on which the entire success of his\neffort depended. In the face of Louis’s suspicion, Vince simply laid it on with\nmanipulation, using an appeal to sympathy (\"going to the doctor\"), and\npressure (\"I’ve got a stack to do, it’s almost 4 o’clock\"), and manipulation\n(\"Tell her\nyou wouldn’t give me the code\"). Cleverly, Vince didn’t actually make a\nthreat, he just implied one: If you don’t give me the security code, I won’t\nsend the customer information that your co worker needs, and I’ll tell her I\nwould have sent it but you wouldn’t cooperate. Still, let’s not be too hasty in blaming Louis. After all, the person on the\nphone knew (or at least appeared to know) that co worker Angela had\nrequested a fax. The caller knew about the security codes, and knew they\nwere identified by letter designation. The caller said his branch manager\nwas requiring it for greater security. There didn’t really seem any reason\nnot to give him the verification he was asking for. Louis isn’t alone. Bank employees give up security codes to social\nengineers every day. Incredible but true. There’s a line in the sand where a private investigator’s techniques stop\nbeing legal and start being illegal. Vince stayed legal when he obtained\nthe branch number. He even stayed legal when he conned Louis into\ngiving him two of the day’s security codes. He crossed the line when he\nhad confidential information on a bank customer faxed to him. But for Vince and his employer, it’s a low-risk crime. When you steal\nmoney or goods, somebody will notice it’s gone. When you steal\ninformation, most of the time no one will notice because the information\nis still in their possession.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nVerbal security codes are equivalent to passwords in providing a\nconvenient and reliable means of protecting data. But employees need to\nbe knowledgeable about the tricks that social engineers use, and trained\nnot to give up the keys to the kingdom.\n\nCOPS AS DUPES\nFor a shady private investigator or social engineer, there are frequent\noccasions when it would be handy to know someone’s driver’s license\nnumber--for example, if you want to assume another person’s identity in\norder to obtain information about her bank balances.\nShort of lifting the person’s wallet or peering over her shoulder at an\nopportune moment, finding out the driver’s license number ought to be\nnext to impossible. But for anyone with even modest social engineering\nskills, it’s hardly a challenge.\nOne particular social engineer--Eric Mantini, I’ll call him, needed to get\ndriver’s license and vehicle registration numbers on a regular basis. Eric\nfigured it was unnecessarily increasing his risk to call the Department of\nMotor Vehicles (DMV) and go through the same ruse time after time\nwhenever he needed that information. He wondered whether there wasn’t\nsome way to simplify the process.\nProbably no one had ever thought of it before, but he figured out a way\nto get the information in a blink, whenever he wanted it. He did it by\ntaking advantage of a service provided by his state’s Department of Motor\nVehicles. Many state DMVs (or whatever the department may be called in\nyour state) make otherwise-privileged information about citizens available\nto insurance firms, private investigators, and certain other groups that the\nstate legislature has deemed entitled to share it for the good of commerce\nand the society at large.\nThe DMV, of course, has appropriate limitations on which types of data\nwill be given out. The insurance industry can get certain types of\ninformation from the files, but not others. A different set of limitations\napplies to PIs, and so on.\nFor law enforcement officers, a different rule generally applies: The DMV\nwill supply any information in the records to any sworn peace officer who\nproperly identifies himself. In the state Eric then lived in, the required\nidentification was a Requestor Code issued by the DMV, along with the\nofficer’s driver’s license number. The DMV employee would always\nverify by matching the officer’s name against his driver’s license number\nand one other piece of information--usually date of birth-- before giving\nout any information.\nWhat social engineer Eric wanted to do was nothing less than cloak\nhimself in the identity of a law enforcement officer.\nHow did he manage that? By running a reverse sting on the cops!\nEric(cid:146)s Sting\nFirst he called telephone information and asked for the phone number of\nDMV headquarters in the state capitol. He was given the number 503555-\n5000; that, of course, is the number for calls from the general public. He\nthen called a nearby sheriff’s station and asked for Teletype--the office\nwhere communications are sent to and received from other law\nenforcement agencies, the national crime database, local warrants, and so\nforth. When he reached Teletype, he said he was looking for the phone\nnumber for law enforcement to use when calling the DMV state\nheadquarters.\n\"Who are you?\" the police officer in Teletype asked.\n\"This is Al. I was calling 503-555-5753,\" he said. This was partly an\nassumption, and partly a number he pulled out of thin air; certainly the\nspecial DMV office set up to take law enforcement calls would be in the\nsame area code as the number gtyen out for the public to call, and it was\nalmost as certain that the next three digits, the prefix, would be the same.\nas well. All he really needed to find out was the last four.\nA sheriff’s Teletype room doesn’t get calls from the public. And the caller\nalready had most of the number. Obviously he was legitimate.\n\"It’s 503-555-6127,\" the officer said.\nSo Eric now had the special phone number for law enforcement officers to\ncall the DMV. But just the one number wasn’t enough to satisfy him; the\noffice would have a good many more than the single phone line, and Eric\nneeded to know how many lines there were, and the phone number of\neach.\nThe Switch\nTo carry out his plan, he needed to gain access to the telephone switch\nthat handled the law enforcement phone lines into DMV. He called the\nstate Telecommunications Department and claimed he was from Nortel,\nthe manufacturer of the DMS-100, one of the most widely used\ncommercial telephone switches. He said, \"Can you please transfer me to\none of the switch technicians that works on the DMS-100?\"\nWhen he reached the technician, he claimed to be with the Nortel\nTechnical Assistance Support Center in Texas, and explained that they\nwere creating a master database to update all switches with the latest\nsoftware upgrades. It would all be done remotely--no need for any switch\ntechnician to participate. But they needed the dial-in number to the switch\nso that they could perform the updates directly from the Support Center.\nIt sounded completely plausible, and the technician gave Eric the phone\nnumber. He could now dial directly into one of the state’s telephone\nswitches.\nTo defend against outside intruders, commercial switches of this type are\npassword-protected, just like every corporate computer network. Any\ngood social engineer with a phone-phreaking background knows that\nNortel switches provide a default account name for software updates:\nNTAS (the abbreviation for Nortel Technical Assistance Support; not\nvery subtle). But what about a password? Eric dialed in several times,\neach time\ntrying one of the obvious and commonly used choices. Entering the same\nas the account name, NTAS, didn’t work. Neither did \"helper.\" Nor did\n\"patch.\"\nThen he tried \"update\" . . . and he was in. Typical. Using an obvious,\neasily guessed password is only very slightly better than having no\npassword at all.\nIt helps to be up to speed in your field; Eric probably knew as much about\nthat switch and how to program and troubleshoot it as the technician.\nOnce he was able to access the switch as an authorized user, he would\ngain full control over the telephone lines that were his target. From his\ncomputer, he queried the switch for the phone number he had been given\nfor law enforcement calls to the DMV, 555-6127. He found there were\nnineteen other phone lines into the same department. Obviously they\nhandled a high volume of calls.\nFor each incoming call, the switch was programmed to \"hunt\" through the\ntwenty lines until it found one that wasn’t busy.\nHe picked line number eighteen in the sequence, and entered the code that\nadded call forwarding to that line. For the call-forwarding number, he\nentered the phone number of his new, cheap, prepaid cell phone, the kind\nthat drug dealers are so fond of because they’re inexpensive enough to\nthrow away after the job is over.\nWith call forwarding now activated on the eighteenth line, as soon as the\noffice got busy enough to have seventeen calls in progress, the next call to\ncome in would not ring in the DMV office but would instead be\nforwarded to Eric’s cell phone. He sat back and waited.\nA Call to DMV\nShortly before 8 o’clock that morning, the cell phone rang. This part was\nthe best, the most delicious. Here was Eric, the social engineer, talking to\na cop, someone with the authority to come and arrest him, or get a search\nwarrant and conduct a raid to collect evidence against him.\nAnd not just one cop would call, but a string of them, one after another.\nOn one occasion, Eric was sitting in a restaurant having lunch with\nfriends, fielding a call every five minutes or so, writing the information on\na paper napkin using a borrowed pen. HE still finds this hilarious.\nBut talking to police officers doesn’t faze a good social engineer in the\nleast. In fact, the thrill of deceiving these law enforcement agencies\nprobably added to Eric s enjoyment of the act.\nAccording to Eric, the calls went something like this:\n\"DMV, may I help you?\"\n\"This is Detective Andrew Cole.\"\n\"Hi, detective. What can I do for you today?\"\n\"I need a Soundex on driver’s license 005602789,\" he might say, using the\nterm familiar in law enforcement to ask for a photo--useful, for example,\nwhen officers are going out to arrest a suspect and want to know what he\nlooks like.\n\"Sure, let me bring up the record,\" Eric would say. \"And, Detective Cole,\nwhat’s your agency?\"\n\"Jefferson County.\" And then Eric would ask the hot questions:\n\"Detective, what’s your requestor code?\nWhat’s your driver’s license number. \"What’s your date of birth\"\nThe caller would give his personal identifying information. Eric would go\nthrough some pretense of verifying the information, and then tell the\ncaller that the identifying information had been confirmed, and ask for the\ndetails of what the caller wanted to find out from the DMV. He’d pretend\nto start looking up the name, with the caller able to hear the clicking of\nthe keys, and then say something like, \"Oh, damn, my computer just\nwent down again. Sorry, detective, my computer has been on the blink,\nall week. Would you mind calling back and getting another clerk to help\nyou?\"\nThis way he’d end the call tying up the loose ends without arousing any\nsuspicion about why he wasn’t able to assist the officer with his request.\nMeanwhile Eric had a stolen identity--details he could use to obtain\nconfidential DMV information whenever he needed to.\nAfter taking calls for a few hours and obtaining dozens of requestor\ncodes, Eric dialed into the switch and deactivated the call forwarding.\nFor months after that, he’d carry on the assignments jobbed out to him by\nlegitimate PI firms that didn’t want to know how he was getting his\ninformation. Whenever he needed to, he’d dial back into the switch, turn\non call forwarding, and gather another stack of police officer credentials.\nAnalyzing the Con\nLet’s run a playback on the ruses Eric pulled on a series of people to make\nthis deceit work. In the first successful step, he got a sheriff’s deputy in a\nTeletype room to give out a confidential DMV phone number to a\ncomplete stranger, accepting the man as a deputy without requesting any\nverification.\nThen someone at the state Telecom Department did the same thing,\naccepting Eric’s claim that he was with an equipment manufacturer, and\nproviding the stranger with a phone number for dialing into the telephone\nswitch serving the DMV.\nEric was able to get into the switch in large measure because of weak\nsecurity practices on the part of the switch manufacturer in using the same\naccount name on all their switches. That carelessness made it a walk in\nthe park for the social engineer to guess the password, knowing once\nagain that switch technicians, just like almost everybody else, choose\npasswords that will be a cinch for them to remember.\nWith access to the switch, he set up call forwarding from one of the DMV\nphone lines for law enforcement to his own cell phone.\nAnd then, the capper and most blatant part, he conned one law\nenforcement officer after another into revealing not only their requestor\ncodes but their own personal identifying information, giving Eric the\nability to impersonate them.\nWhile there was certainly technical knowledge required to pull off this\nstunt, it could not have worked without the help of a series of people who\nhad no clue that they were talking to an imposter.\nThis story was another illustration of the phenomenon of why people don’t\nask \"Why me?\" Why would the Teletype officer give this information to\nsome sheriff’s deputy he didn’t know--or, in this case, a stranger passing\nhimself off as a sheriff’s deputy--instead of suggesting he get the\ninformation from a fellow deputy or his own sergeant? Again, the only\nanswer I can offer is that people rarely ask this question. It doesn’t occur\nto them to ask? They don’t want to sound challenging and unhelpful?\nMaybe. Any further explanation would just be guesswork. But social\nengineers don’t care why; they only care that this little fact makes it easy\nto get information that otherwise might be a challenge to obtain.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nIf you have a telephone switch at your company facilities, what would the\nperson in charge do if he received a call from the vendor, asking for the\ndial-in number? And by the way, has that person ever changed the default\npassword for the switch? Is that password an easy-to-guess word found in\nany dictionary?\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nA security code, properly used, adds a valuable layer of protection. A\nsecurity code improperly used can be worse than none at all because it\ngives the illusion of security where it doesn’t really exist. What good are\ncodes if your employees don’t keep them. secret?\nAny company with a need for verbal security codes needs to spell out\nclearly for its employees when and how the codes are used. Properly\ntrained, the character in the first story in this chapter would not have had\nto rely on his instincts, easily overcome, when asked to give a security\ncode to a stranger. He sensed that he should not be asked for this\ninformation under the circumstances, but lacking a clear security policy--\nand good common sense--he readily gave in.\nSecurity procedures should also set up steps to follow when an employee\nfields an inappropriate request for a security code. All employees should\nbe trained to immediately report any request for authentication\ncredentials, such as a daily code or password, made under suspicious\ncircumstances. They should also report when an attempt to verify the\nidentity of a requestor doesn’t check out.\nAt the very least, the employee should record the caller’s name, phone\nnumber, and office or department, and then hang up. Before calling back\nhe should verify that the organization really does have an employee of\nthat name, and that the call back phone number matches the phone\nnumber in the on-line or hard-copy company directory. Most of the time,\nthis simple tactic will be all that’s needed to verify that the caller is who\nhe says he is.\nVerifying becomes a bit trickier when the company has a published\nphone directory instead of an on-line version. People get hired; people\nleave; people change departments, job positions, and phone. The hard-\ncopy directory is already out of date the day after it’s published, even\nbefore being distributed. Even on-line directories can’t always be relied\non, because social engineers know how to modify them. If an employee\ncan’t verify the phone number from an independent source, she should be\ninstructed to verify by some other means, such as contacting the\nemployee’s manager.\nPart 3\nIntruder Alert\nEntering the Premises\nWhy is it so easy for an outsider to assume the identity of a company\nemployee and carry off an impersonation so convincingly that even\npeople who are highly security conscious are taken in? Why is it so easy\nto dupe individuals who may be fully aware of security procedures,\nsuspicious of people they don’t personally know, and protective of their\ncompany’s interests?\nPonder these questions as you read the stories in this chapter.\n\nTHE EMBARRASSED SECURITY GUARD\nDate/Time: Tuesday, October 17, 2:16 A.M. Place: Skywatcher Aviation, Inc. manufacturing plant on the outskirts of\nTucson, Arizona. The Security Guard’s Story\nHearing his leather heels click against the floor in the halls of the nearly\ndeserted plant made Leroy Greene feel much better than spending the\nnight hours of his watch in front of the video monitors in the security\noffice. There he wasn’t allowed to do anything but stare at the screens, not\neven read a magazine or his leather-bound Bible. You just had to sit there\nlooking at the displays of still images where nothing ever moved. But walking the halls, he was at least stretching his legs, and when he\nremembered to throw his arms and shoulders into the walk, it got him a\nlittle exercise, too. Although it didn’t really count very much as exercise\nfor a man who had played right tackle on the All-City champion high\nschool football team. Still, he thought, a job is a job. He turned the southwest corner and started along the gallery overlooking\nthe half-mile-long production floor. He glanced down and saw two people\nwalking past the line of partly built copters. The pair stopped and seemed\nto be pointing things out to each other. A strange sight at this time of\nnight. ’Better check, \"he thought. Leroy headed for a staircase that would bring him onto the production-\nline floor behind the pair, and they didn’t sense his approach until he\nstepped alongside. \"Morning. Can I see your security badges, please,\" he\nsaid. Leroy always tried to keep his voice soft at moments like this; he\nknew that the sheer size of him could seem threatening. \"Hi, Leroy,\" one of them said, reading the name off his badge. \"I’m Tom\nStilton, from the Marketing office at corporate in Phoenix. I’m in town for\nmeetings and wanted to show my friend here how the world’s greatest\nhelicopters get built.\"\n\"Yes, sir. Your badge, please,\" Leroy said. He couldn’t help noticing how\nyoung they seemed. The Marketing guy looked barely out of high school,\nthe other one had hair down to his shoulders and looked about fifteen. The one with the haircut reached into his pocket for his badge, then\nstarted patting all his pockets. Leroy was suddenly beginning to have a\nbad feeling about this. \"Damn,\" the guy said. \"Must’ve left it in the car. I\ncan get it--just take me ten minutes to go out to the parking lot and back.\"\nLeroy had his pad out by this time. \"What’d you say your name was, sr. he\nasked, and carefully wrote down the response. Then he asked them to go\nwith him to the Security Office. On the elevator to the third floor, Tom\nchatted about having been with the company for only six months and\nhoped he wasn’t going to get in any trouble for this. In the Security monitoring room, the two others on the night shift with\nLeroy joined him in questioning the pair. Stilton gave his telephone\nnumber, and said his boss was Judy Underwood and gave her telephone\nnumber, and the information all checked out on the computer. Leroy took\nthe other two security people aside and they talked about what to do. Nobody wanted to get this wrong; all three agreed they better call the\nguy’s boss even though it would mean waking her in the middle of the\nnight. Leroy called Mrs. Underwood himself, explained who he was and did she\nhave a Mr. Tom Stilton working for her? She sounded like she was still\nhalf-asleep. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Well, we found him down on the production line at 2:30 in the morning\nwith no ID badge.\"\nMrs. Underwood said, \"Let me talk to him.\"\nStilton got on the phone and said, \"Judy, I’m really sorry about these\nguys waking you up in the middle of the night. I hope you’re not going to\nhold this against me.\"\nHe listened and then said, \"It was just that I had to be here in the morning\nanyway, for that meeting on the new press release. Anyway, did you get\nthe email about the Thompson deal? We need to meet with Jim on\nMonday morning so we don’t lose this. And I’m still having lunch with\nyou on Tuesday, right?\"\nHe listened a bit more and said good-bye and hung up. That caught Leroy by surprise; he had thought he’d get the phone back\nso the lady could tell him everything was okay. He wondered if maybe he\nshould call her again and ask, but thought better of it. He had already\nbothered her once in the middle of the night; if he called a second time,\nmaybe she might get annoyed and complain to his boss. \"Why make\nwaves?\" he thought. Okay if I show my friend the rest of the production line? Stilton asked\nLeroy\nYou want to come along, keep an eye on us ? \"Go on, Leroy said. \"Look around. Just don’t forget your badge next\ntime. And let Security know if you need to be on the plant floor after\nhours--it’s the rule.\"\nI’ll remember that, Leroy,\" Stilton said. And they left. Hardly ten minutes had gone by before the phone rang in the Security\nOffice. Mrs. Underwood was on the line. \"Who was that guy?!\" she\nwanted to know. She said she kept trying to ask questions but he just kept\non talking about having lunch with her and she doesn’t know who the hell\nhe is. The security guys called the lobby and the guard at the gate to the parking\nlot. Both reported the two young men had left some minutes before. Telling the story later, Leroy always finished by saying, \"Lordy, did boss\nchew me up one side and down the other. I’m lucky I still have a job.\"\nJoe Harper’s Story\nJust to see what he could get away with, seventeen-year-old Joe Harper\nhad been sneaking into buildings for more than a year, sometimes in the\ndaytime, sometimes at night. The son of a musician and a cocktail\nwaitress, both working the night shift, Joe had too much time by himself. His story of that same incident sheds instructive light on how it all\nhappened. I have this friend Kenny who thinks he wants to be a helicopter pilot. He\nasked me, could I get him into the Skywatcher factory to see the\nproduction line where they make the choppers. He knows I’ve got into\nother places before. It’s an adrenaline rush to see if you can slip into\nplaces you’re not supposed to be. But you don’t just walk into a factory or office building. Got to think it\nthrough, do a lot of planning, and do a full reconnaissance on the target. Check the company’s Web page for names and titles, reporting structure,\nand telephone numbers. Read press clippings and magazine articles. Meticulous research is my own brand of caution, so I could talk to\nanybody that challenged me, with as much knowledge as any employee. So where to start? First I looked up on the Internet to see where the\ncompany had offices, and saw the corporate headquarters was in Phoenix. Perfect. I called and asked for Marketing; every company has a marketing\ndepartment. A lady answered, and I said I was with Blue Pencil Graphics\nand we wanted to see if we could interest them in using our services and\nwho would I talk to. She said that would be Tom Stilton. I asked for his\nphone number and she said they didn’t give out that information but she\ncould put me through. The call rang into voice mail, and his message said,\n\"This is Tom Stilton in Graphics, extension 3147, please leave a\nmessage.\" Sure--they don’t give out extensions, but this guy leaves his\nright on his voice mail. So that was cool. Now I had a name and\nextension. Another call, back to the same office. \"Hi, I was looking for Tom Stilton. He’s not in. I’d like to ask his boss a quick question.\" The boss was out,\ntoo, but by the time I was finished, I knew the boss’s name. And she had\nnicely left her extension number on her voice mail, too. I could probably get us past the lobby guard with no sweat, but I’ve driven\nby that plant and I thought I remembered a fence around the parking lot. A fence means a guard who checks you when you try to drive in. And at\nnight, they might be writing down license numbers, too, so I’d have to buy\nan old license plate at a flea market. But first I’d have to get the phone number in the guard shack. I waited a\nlittle so if I got the same operator when I dialed back in, she wouldn’t\nrecognize my voice. After a bit I called and said, \"We’ve got a complaint\nthat the phone at the Ridge Road guard shack has reported intermittent\nproblems--are they still having trouble?\" She said she didn’t know but\nwould connect me. The guy answered, \"Ridge Road gate, this is Ryan.\" I said, \"Hi, Ryan,\nthis is Ben. Were you having problems with your phones there?\" He’s just\na low-paid security guard but I guess he had some training because he\nright away said, \"Ben who--what’s your last name?\" I just kept right on as\nif I hadn’t even heard him. \"Somebody reported a problem earlier.\"\nI could hear him holding the phone away and calling out, \"Hey, Bruce,\nRoger, was there a problem with this phone. He came back on and said,\n\"No, no problems we know about.\"\n\"How many phone lines do you have there?\"\nHe had forgotten about my name. \"Two,\" he said. \"Which one are you on\nnow?\" \"3140.\"\nGotcha! \"And they’re both working okay?\"\n\"Seems like.\"\nOkay, I said. Listen, Tom, if you have any phone problems, just call\nus in Telecom any time. We’re here to help.\"\nMy buddy and I decided to visit the plant the very next night. Late that\nafternoon I called the guard booth, using the name of the Marketing guy. I\nsaid, \"Hi, this is Tom Stilton in Graphics. We’re on a crash deadline and I\nhave a couple of guys driving into town to help out. Probably won’t be\nhere till one or two in the morning. Will you still be on then?\"\nHe was happy to say that, no, he got off at midnight. I said, \"Well, just leave a note for the next guy, okay? When two guys\nshow up and say they’ve come to see Tom Stilton, just wave ’em on in--\nokay?\"\nYes, he said, that was fine. He took down my name, department, and\nextension number and said he’d take care of it. We drove up to the gate a little after two, I gave Tom Stilton’s name,\nand a sleepy guard just pointed to the door we should go in and where I\nshould park. When we walked into the building, there was another guard station in\nthe lobby, with the usual book for after-hours sign-ins. I told the guard I\nhad a report that needed to be ready in the morning, and this friend of\nmine wanted to see the plant. \"He’s crazy about helicopters,\" I said\n\"Thinks he wants to learn to pilot one.\" He asked me for my badge. I\nreached into a pocket, then patted around and said I must have left it in\ncar; I(cid:146)ll go get it. I said, \"It’ll take about ten minutes.\" He said, Never\nmind, it’s okay, just sign in.\"\nWalking down that production line--what a gas. Until that tree-trunk of a\nLeroy stopped us. In the security office, I figured somebody who didn’t really belong would\nlook nervous and frightened. When things get tight, I just start sounding\nlike I’m really steamed. Like I’m really who I claimed to be and it’s\nannoying they don’t believe me. When they started talking about maybe they should call the lady I said\nwas my boss and went to get her home phone number from the computer,\nI stood there thinking, \"Good time to just make a break for it.\" But there\nwas that parking-lot gate--even if we got out of the building, they’d close\nthe gate and we’d never make it out. When Leroy called the lady who was Stilton’s boss and then gave me the\nphone, the lady started shouting at me \"Who is this, who are you!\" and I\njust kept on talking like we were having a nice conversation, and then\nhung up. How long does it take to find somebody who can give you a company\nphone number in the middle of the night? I figured we had less than\nfifteen minutes to get out of there before that lady was ringing the security\noffice and putting a bug in their ears. We got out of there as fast as we could without looking like we were in a\nhurry. Sure was glad when the guy at the gate just waved us through. Analyzing the Con\nIt’s worth noting that in the real incident this story is based on, the\nintruders actually were teenagers. The intrusion was a lark, just to see if\nthey could get away with it. But if it was so easy for a pair of teenagers, it\nwould have been even easier for adult thieves, industrial spies, or\nterrorists. How did three experienced security officers allow a pair of intruders to\njust walk away? And not just any intruders, but a pair so young that any\nreasonable person should have been very suspicious?\n\nLeroy was appropriately suspicious, at first. He was correct in taking them\nto the Security Office, and in questioning the guy who called\nhimself Tom Stilton and checking the names and phone numbers he gave. He was certainly correct in making the phone call to the supervisor. But in the end he was taken in by the young man’s air of confidence and\nindignation. It wasn’t the behavior he would expect from a thief or\nintruder--only a real employee would have acted that way.., or so he\nassumed. Leroy should have been trained to count on solid identification,\nnot perceptions. Why wasn’t he more suspicious when the young man hung up the phone\nwithout handing it back so Leroy could hear the confirmation directly\nfrom Judy Underwood and receive her assurance that the kid had a reason\nfor being in the plant so late at night? Leroy was taken in by a ruse so bold that it should have been obvious. But\nconsider the moment from his perspective: a high-school graduate,\nconcerned for his job, uncertain whether he might get in trouble for\nbothering a company manager for the second time in the middle of the\nnight. If you had been in his shoes, would you have made the follow-up\ncall? But of course, a second phone call wasn’t the only possible action. What\nelse could the security guard have done? Even before placing the phone call, he could have asked both of the pair\nto show some kind of picture identification; they drove to the plant, so at\nleast one of them should have a driver’s license. The fact that they had\noriginally given phony names would have been immediately obvious (a\nprofessional would have come equipped with fake ID, but these teenagers\nhad not taken that precaution). In any case, Leroy should have examined\ntheir identification credentials and written down the information. If they\nboth insisted they had no identification, he should then have walked them\no the car to retrieve the company ID badge that \"Tom Stilton\" claimed he\nhad left there.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nManipulative people usually have very attractive personalities. They are\ntypically fast on their feet and quite articulate. Social engineers are also\nskilled at distracting people’s thought processes so that they cooperate. To\nthink that any one particular person is not vulnerable to this manipulation\nis to underestimate the skill and the killer instinct of the social engineer.\nA good social engineer, on the other hand, never underestimates his\nadversary.\nFollowing the phone call, one of the security people should have stayed\nwith the pair until they left the building. And then walked them to their\ncar and written down the license-plate number. If he had been observant\nenough, he would have noted that the plate (the one that the attacker had\npurchased at a flea market) did not have a valid registration sticker - and\nthat should have been reason enough to detain the pair for further\ninvestigation.\n\nDUMPSTER DIVING\nDumpster diving is a term that describes pawing through a target’s\ngarbage in search of valuable information. The amount of information you\ncan learn about a target is astounding.\nMost people don’t give much thought to what they’re discarding at home:\nphone bills, credit card statements, medical prescription bottles, bank\nstatements, work-related materials, and so much more.\nAt work, employees must be made aware that people do look through\ntrash to obtain information that may benefit them.\nDuring my high school years, I used to go digging through the trash\nbehind the local phone company buildings--often alone but occasionally\nwith friends who shared an interest in learning more about the telephone\ncompany. Once you became a seasoned Dumpster diver, you learn a few\ntricks, such as how to make special efforts to avoid the bags from the\nrestrooms, and the necessity of wearing gloves.\nDumpster diving isn’t enjoyable, but the payoff was extraordinary--\ninternal company telephone directories, computer manuals, employee\nlists, discarded printouts showing how to program switching equipment,\nand more--all there for the taking.\nI’d schedule visits for nights when new manuals were being issued,\nbecause the trash containers would have plenty of old ones, thoughtlessly\nthrown away. And I’d go at other odd times as well, looking for any\nmemos, letters, reports, and so forth, that might offer some interesting\ngems of information.\nOn arriving I’d find some cardboard boxes, pull them out and set them\naside. If anyone challenged me, which happened now and then, I’d say\nthat a friend was moving and I was just looking for boxes to help him\npack. The guard never noticed all the documents I had put in the boxes to\ntake home. In some cases, he’d tell me to get lost, so I’d just move to\nanother phone company central office.\n\nLINGO\nDUMPSTER DRIVING Going through a company(cid:146)s garbage (often in\nan outside and vulnerable Dumpster) to find discarded information that\neither itself has value, or provides a tool to use in a social engineering\nattack, such as internal phone numbers or titles\nI don’t know what it’s like today, but back then it was easy to tell which\nbags might contain something of interest. The floor sweepings and\ncafeteria garbage were loose in the large bags, while the office\nwastebaskets were all lined with white disposable trash bags, which the\ncleaning crew would lift out one by one and wrap a tie around.\nOne time, while searching with some friends, we came up with some\nsheets of paper torn up by hand. And not just torn up: someone had gone\nto the trouble of ripping the sheets into tiny pieces, all conveniently\nthrown out in a single five-gallon trash bag. We took the bag to a local\ndonut shop, dumped the pieces out on a table, and started assembling\nthem one by one.\nWe were all puzzle-doers, so this offered the stimulating challenge of a\ngiant jigsaw puzzle . . . but turned out to have more than a childish\nreward. When done, we had pieced together the entire account name and\npassword list for one of the company’s critical computer systems.\nWere our Dumpster-diving exploits worth the risk and the effort? You bet\nthey were. Even more than you would think, because the risk is zero. It\nwas true then and still true today: As long as you’re not trespassing,\nporing through someone else’s trash is 100 percent legal.\nOf course, phone phreaks and hackers aren’t the only ones with their\nheads in trash cans. Police departments around the country paw through\ntrash regularly, and a parade of people from Mafia dons to petty\nembezzlers have been convicted based in part on evidence gathered from\ntheir rubbish. Intelligence agencies, including our own, have resorted to\nthis method for years.\nIt may be a tactic too low down for James Bond--movie-goers would\nmuch rather watch him outfoxing the villain and bedding a beauty than\nstanding up to his knees in garbage. Real-life spies are less squeamish\nwhen something of value may be bagged among the banana peels and\ncoffee grounds, the newspapers and grocery lists. Especially if gathering\nthe information doesn’t put them in harm’s way.\nCash for Trash\nCorporations play the Dumpster-diving game, too. Newspapers had a field\nday in June 2000, reporting that Oracle Corporation (whose CEO,\nLarry Ellison, is probably the nation’s most outspoken foe of Microsoft)\nhad hired an investigative firm that had been caught with their hands in\nthe cookie jar. It seems the investigators wanted trash from a Microsoft-\nsupported lobbying outfit, ACT, but they didn’t want to risk getting\ncaught. According to press reports, the investigative firm sent in a woman\nwho offered the janitors $60 to let her have the ACT trash. They turned\nher down. She was back the next night, upping the offer to $500 for the\ncleaners and $200 for the supervisor.\nThe janitors turned her down and then turned her in.\nLeading on-line journalist Declan McCullah, taking a leaf from literature,\ntitled his Wired News story on the episode, \"’Twas Oracle That Spied on\nMS.\" Time magazine, nailing Oracle’s Ellison, titled their article simply\n\"Peeping Larry.\"\nAnalyzing the Con\nBased on my own experience and the experience of Oracle, you might\nwonder why anybody would bother taking the risk of stealing someone’s\ntrash.\nThe answer, I think, is that the risk is nil and the benefits can be\nsubstantial. Okay, maybe trying to bribe the janitors increases the chance\nof consequences, but for anyone who’s willing to get a little dirty, bribes\naren’t necessary.\nFor a social engineer, Dumpster diving has its benefits. He can get enough\ninformation to guide his assault against the target company, including\nmemos, meeting agendas, letters and the like that reveal names,\ndepartments, titles, phone numbers, and project assignments. Trash can\nyield company organizational charts, information about corporate\nstructure, travel schedules, and so on. All those details might seem trivial\nto insiders, yet they may be highly valuable information to an attacker.\nMark Joseph Edwards, in his book Internet Security with Windows NT,\ntalks about \"entire reports discarded because of typos, passwords written\non scraps of paper, ’While you were out’ messages with phone numbers,\nwhole file folders with documents still in them, diskettes and tapes that\nweren’t erased or destroyed--all of which could help a would-be intruder.\"\nThe writer goes on to ask, \"And who are those people on your cleaning\ncrew? You’ve decided that the cleaning crew won’t [be permitted to] enter\nthe computer room but don’t forget the other trash cans. If federal\nagencies deem it necessary to do background checks on people who have\naccess to their wastebaskets and shredders, you probably should as well.\"\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nYour trash may be your enemy’s treasure. We don’t give much\nconsideration to the materials we discard in our personal lives, so why\nshould we believe people have a different attitude in the workplace? It all\ncomes down to educating the workforce about the danger (unscrupulous\npeople digging for valuable information) and the vulnerability (sensitive\ninformation not being shredded or properly erased).\n\nTHE HUMILIATED BOSS\nNobody thought anything about it when Harlan Fortis came to work on\nMonday morning as usual at the County Highway Department, and said\nhe’d left home in a hurry and forgotten his badge. The security guard had\nseen Harlan coming in and going out every weekday for the two years she\nhad been working there. She had him sign for a temporary employee’s\nbadge, gave it to him, and he went on his way.\nIt wasn’t until two days later that all hell started breaking loose. The\nstory spread through the entire department like wildfire. Half the people\nwho heard it said it couldn’t be true. Of the rest, nobody seemed to know\nwhether to laugh out loud or to feel sorry for the poor soul.\nAfter all, George Adamson was a kind and compassionate person, the\nbest head of department they’d ever had. He didn’t deserve to have this\nhappen to him. Assuming that the story was true, of course.\nThe trouble had begun when George called Harlan into his office late\none Friday and told him, as gently as he could, that come Monday Harlan\nwould be reporting to a new job. With the Sanitation Department. To\nHarlan, this wasn’t like being fired. It was worse; it was humiliating. He\nwasn’t going to take it lying down.\nThat same evening he seated himself on his porch to watch the\nhomeward- bound traffic. At last he spotted the neighborhood boy named\nDavid who everyone called \"The War Games Kid\" going by on his moped\non the way home from high school. He stopped David, gave him a Code\nRed Mountain Dew he had bought especially for the purpose, and offered\nhim a deal: the latest video game player and six games in exchange for\nsome computer help and a promise of keeping his mouth shut.\nAfter Harlan explained the project - without giving any of the\ncompromising specifics--David agreed. He described what he wanted\nHarlan to do. He was to buy a modem, go into the office, find somebody’s\ncomputer where there was a spare phone jack nearby, and plug in the\nmodem. Leave the modem under the desk where nobody would be likely\nto see it. Then\ncame the risky part. Harlan had to sit down at the computer, install a\nremote-access software package, and get it running. Any moment the man\nwho worked in the office might show up, or someone might walk by and\nsee him in another person’s office. He was so uptight that he could hardly\nread the instructions that the kid had written down for him. But he got it\ndone, and slipped out of the building without being noticed.\nPlanting the Bomb\nDavid stopped over after dinner that night. The two sat down at Harlan’s\ncomputer and within in a few minutes the boy had dialed into the\nmodem, gained access, and reached George Adamson’s machine. Not\nvery\ndifficult, since George never had time for precautionary things like\nchanging\npasswords, and was forever asking this person or that to download or\nemail a file for him. In time, everyone in the office knew his password.\nA bit of hunting turned up the file called BudgetSlides2002.ppt, which\nthe boy downloaded onto Harlan’s computer. Harlan then told the kid to\ngo on home, and come back in a couple of hours.\nWhen David returned, Harlan asked him to reconnect to the Highway\nDepartment computer system and put the same file back where they had\nfound it, overwriting the earlier version. Harlan showed David the video\ngame player, and promised that if things went well, he’d have it the next\nday.\nSurprising George\nYou wouldn’t think that something sounding as dull as budget hearings\nwould be of much interest to anyone, but the meeting chamber of the\nCounty Council was packed, filled with reporters, representatives of\nspecial\ninterest groups, members of the public, and even two television news\ncrews.\nGeorge always felt much was at stake for him in these sessions. The\nCounty Council held the purse strings, and unless George could put on a\nconvincing presentation, the Highways budget would be slashed. Then\neveryone would start complaining about potholes and stuck traffic lights\nand dangerous intersections, and blaming him, and life would be miser\nable for the whole coming year. But when he was introduced that\nevening,\nhe stood up feeling confident. He had worked six weeks on this\npresentation\nand the PowerPoint visuals, which he had tried out on his wife, his\ntop staff people, and some respected friends. Everyone agreed it was his\nbest presentation ever.\nThe first three PowerPoint images played well. For a change, every\nCouncil member was paying attention. He was making his points\neffectively.\nAnd then all at once everything started going wrong. The fourth image\nwas supposed to be a beautiful photo at sunset of the new highway\nextension opened last year. Instead it was something else, something very\nembarrassing. A photograph out of a magazine like Penthouse or Hustler.\nHe could hear the audience gasp as he hurriedly hit the button on his\nlaptop to move to the next image.\nThis one was worse. Not a thing was left to the imagination.\nHe was still trying to click to another image when someone in the\naudience pulled out the power plug to the projector while the chairman\nbanged loudly with his gavel and shouted above the din that the meeting\nwas adjourned.\nAnalyzing the Con\nUsing a teenage hacker’s expertise, a disgruntled employee managed to\naccess the computer of the head of his department, download an important\nPowerPoint presentation, and replace some of the slides with images\ncertain to cause grave embarrassment. Then he put the presentation back\non the man’s computer.\nWith the modem plugged into a jack and connected to one of the office\ncomputers, the young hacker was able to dial in from the outside. The kid\nhad set up the remote access software in advance so that, once connected\nto the computer, he would have full access to every file stored on the\nentire system. Since the computer was connected to the organization’s\nnetwork and he already knew the boss’s username and password, he could\neasily gain access to the boss’s files.\nIncluding the time to scan in the magazine images, the entire effort had\ntaken only a few hours. The resulting damage to a good man’s reputation\nwas beyond imagining.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nThe vast majority of employees who are transferred, fired, or let go in a\ndownsizing are never a problem. Yet it only takes one to make a\ncompany realize too late what steps they could have taken to prevent\ndisaster.\nExperience and statistics have clearly shown that the greatest threat to the\nenterprise is from insiders. It’s the insiders who have intimate knowledge\nof where the valuable information resides, and where to hit the company\nto cause the most harm.\n\nTHE PROMOTION SEEKER\nLate in the morning of a pleasant autumn day, Peter Milton walked into\nthe lobby of the Denver regional offices of Honorable Auto Parts, a\nnational parts wholesaler for the automobile aftermarket. He waited at the\nreception desk while the young lady signed in a visitor, gave driving\ndirections to a caller, and dealt with the UPS man, all more or less at the\nsame time.\n\"So how did you learn to do so many things at once?\" Pete said when she\nhad time to help him. She smiled, obviously pleased he had noticed. He\nwas from Marketing in the Dallas office, he told her, and said that Mike\nTalbott from Atlanta field sales was going to be meeting him. \"We have a\nclient to visit together this afternoon,\" he explained. I’ll just wait here in\nthe lobby.\"\n\"Marketing.\" She said the word almost wistfully, and Pete smiled at her,\nwaiting to hear what was coming. \"If I could go to college, that’s what I’d\ntake,\" she said. \"I’d love to work in Marketing.\"\nHe smiled again. \"Kaila,\" he said, reading her name off the sign on the\ncounter, \"We have a lady in the Dallas office who was a secretary. She\ngot herself moved over to Marketing. That was three years ago, and now\nshe’s an assistant marketing manager, making twice what she was.\"\nKaila looked starry-eyed. He went on, \"Can you use a computer?\" \"Sure,\"\nshe said.\n\"How would you like me to put your name in for a secretary’s job in\nMarketing.\nShe beamed. \"For that I’d even move to Dallas.\"\n\"You’re going to love Dallas,\" he said. \"I can’t promise an opening right\naway, but I’ll see what I can do.\"\nShe thought that this nice man in the suit and tie and with the neatly\ntrimmed, well-combed hair might make a big difference in her working\nlife.\nPete sat down across the lobby, opened his laptop, and started getting\nsome work done. After ten or fifteen minutes, he stepped back up to the\ncounter. \"Listen,\" he said, \"it looks like Mike must’ve been held up. Is\nthere a conference room where I could sit and check my emails while I’m\nwaiting?\"\nKaila called the man who coordinated the conference room scheduling\nand arranged for Pete to use one that wasn’t booked. Following a pattern\npicked up from Silicon Valley companies (Apple was probably the first to\ndo this) some of the conference rooms were named after cartoon\ncharacters, others after restaurant chains or movie stars or comic book\nheroes. He was told to look for the Minnie Mouse room. She had him sign\nin, and gave him directions to find Minnie Mouse.\nHe located the room, settled in, and connected his laptop to the Ethernet\nport.\nDo you get the picture yet?\nRight--the intruder had connected to the network behind the corporate\nfirewall.\nAnthony’s Story\nI guess you could call Anthony Lake a lazy businessman. Or maybe\n\"bent\" comes closer.\nInstead of working for other people, he had decided he wanted to go to\nwork for himself; he wanted to open a store, where he could be at one\nplace all day and not have to run all over the countryside. Only he wanted\nto have a business that he could be as sure as possible he could make\nmoney at.\nWhat kind of store? That didn’t take long to figure out. He knew about\nrepairing cars, so an auto parts store.\nAnd how do you build in a guarantee of success? The answer came to him\nin a flash: convince auto parts wholesaler Honorable Auto Parts to sell\nhim all the merchandise he needed at their cost.\nNaturally they wouldn’t do this willingly. But Anthony knew how to con\npeople, his friend Mickey knew about breaking into other people’s\ncomputers, and together they worked out a clever plan.\nThat autumn day he convincingly passed himself off as an employee\nnamed Peter Milton, and he had conned his way inside the Honorable\nAuto Parts offices and had already plugged his laptop into their network.\nSo far, so good, but that was only the first step. What he still had to do\nwouldn’t be easy, especially since Anthony had set himself a fifteen-\nminute time limit--any longer and he figured that the risk of discovery\nwould be too high.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nTrain your people not to judge a book solely by its cover--just because\nsomeone is well-dressed and well-groomed he shouldn’t be any more\nbelievable.\nIn an earlier phone call pretexting as a support person from their computer\nsupplier, he had put on a song-and-dance act. \"Your company has\npurchased a two-year support plan and we’re putting you in the database\nso we can know when a software program you’re using has come out with\na patch or a new updated version. So I need to have you tell me what\napplications you’re using.\" The response gave him a list of programs, and\nan accountant friend identified the one called MAS 90 as the target--the\nprogram that would hold their list of vendors and the discount and\npayment terms for each.\nWith that key knowledge, he next used a software program to identifiy,\"\nall the working hosts on the network, and it didn’t take him long to locate\nthe correct server used by the Accounting department. From the arsenal of\nhacker tools on his laptop, he launched one program and used it to\nidentify all of the authorized users on the target server. With another, he\nthen ran a list of commonly used passwords, such as \"blank,\" and\n\"password\" itself. \"Password\" worked. No surprise there. People just lose\nall creativity when it comes to choosing passwords.\nOnly six minutes gone, and the game was half over. He was in.\nAnother three minutes to very carefully add his new company, address,\nphone number, and contact name to the list of customers. And then for the\ncrucial entry, the one that would make all the difference, the entry that\nsaid all items were to be sold to him at 1 percent over Honorable Auto\nParts’ cost.\nIn slightly under ten minutes, he was done. He stopped long enough to tell\nKaila thanks, he was through checking his emails. And he had reached\nMike Talbot, change of plans, he was on the way to a meeting at a client’s\noffice. And he wouldn’t forget about recommending her for that job in\nMarketing, either.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThe intruder who called himself Peter Milton used two psychological\nsubversion techniques--one planned, the other improvised on the spur of\nthe moment.\nHe dressed like a management worker earning good money. Suit and tie,\nhair carefully styled--these seem like small details, but they make an\nimpression. I discovered this myself, inadvertently. In a short time as a\nprogrammer at GTE California--a major telephone company no longer in\nexistence--I discovered that if I came in one day without a badge,\nneatly dressed but casual--say, sports shirt, chinos, and Dockers--I’d be\nstopped and questioned. Where’s your badge, who are you, where do you\nwork? Another day I’d arrive, still without a badge but in a suit and tie,\nlooking very corporate. I’d use a variation of the age-old piggybacking\ntechnique, blending in with a crowd of people as they walk into a building\nor a secure entrance. I would latch onto some people as they approached\nthe main entrance, and walk in chatting with the crowd as if I was one of\nthem. I walked past, and even if the guards noticed I was badge-less, they\nwouldn’t bother me because I looked like management and I was with\npeople who were wearing badges.\nFrom this experience, I recognized how predictable the behavior of\nsecurity guards is. Like the rest of us, they were making judgments based\non appearances--a serious vulnerability that social engineers learn to take\nadvantage of.\nThe attacker’s second psychological weapon came into play when he\nnoticed the unusual effort that the receptionist was making. Handling\nseveral things at once, she didn’t get testy but managed to make everyone\nfeel they had her full attention. He took this as the mark of someone\ninterested in getting ahead, in proving herself. And then when he claimed\nto work in the Marketing department, he watched to see her reaction,\nlooking for clues to indicate if he was establishing a rapport with her. He\nwas. To the attacker, this added up to someone he could manipulate\nthrough a promise of trying to help her move into a better job. (Of course,\nif she had said she wanted to go into the Accounting department, he\nwould have claimed he had contacts for getting her a job there, instead.)\nIntruders are also fond of another psychological weapon used in this\nstory: building trust with a two-stage attack. He first used that chatty\nconversation about the job in Marketing, and he also used \"name-\ndropping\"--giving the name of another employee--a real person,\nincidentally, just as the name he himself used was the name of a real\nemployee.\nHe could have followed up the opening conversation right away with a\nrequest to get into a conference room. But instead he sat down for a while\nand pretended to work, supposedly waiting for his associate, another way\nof allaying any possible suspicions because an intruder wouldn’t hang\naround. He didn’t hang around for very long, though; social engineers\nknow better than to stay at the scene of the crime any longer than\nnecessary.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nAllowing a stranger into an area where he can plug a laptop into the\ncorporate network increases the risk of a security incident. It’s perfectly\nreasonable for an employee, especially one from offsite, to want to check\nhis or her email from a conference room, but unless the visitor is\nestablished as a trusted employee or the network is segmented to prevent\nunauthorized connections, this may be the weak link that allows company\nfiles to be compromised.\nJust for the record: By the laws on the books at the time of this writing,\nAnthony had not committed a crime when he entered the lobby. He had\nnot committed a crime when he used the name of a real employee. He had\nnot committed a crime when he talked his way into the conference room.\nHe had not committed a crime when he plugged into the company’s\nnetwork and searched for the target computer.\nNot until he actually broke in to the computer system did he break the\nlaw.\n\nSNOOPING ON KEVIN\nMany years ago when I was working in a small business, I began to\nnotice\nthat each time I walked into the office that I shared with the three other\ncomputer people who made up the IT department, this one particular guy\n(Joe, I’ll call him here) would quickly toggle the display on his computer\nto a different window. I immediately recognized this as suspicious. When\nit happened two more times the same day, I was sure something was\ngoing\non that I should know about. What was this guy up to that he didn’t want\nme to see?\nJoe’s computer acted as a terminal to access the company’s\nminicomputers,\nso I installed a monitoring program on the VAX minicomputer\nthat allowed me to spy on what he was doing. The program acted as if a\nTV camera was looking over his shoulder, showing me exactly what he\nwas seeing on his computer.\nMy desk was next to Joe’s; I turned my monitor as best I could to partly\nmask his view, but he could have looked over at any moment and\nrealized\nI was spying on him. Not a problem; he was too enthralled in what he\nwas\ndoing to notice.\nWhat I saw made my jaw drop. I watched, fascinated, as the bastard\ncalled up my payroll data. He was looking up my salary!\nI had only been there a few months at the time and I guessed Joe couldn’t\nstand the idea that I might have been making more than he was.\nA few minutes later I saw that he was downloading hacker tools used by\nless experienced hackers who don’t know enough about programming to\ndevise the tools for themselves. So Joe was clueless, and had no idea that\none of American’s most experienced hackers was sitting right next to him.\nI thought it was hilarious.\nHe already had the information about my pay; so it was too late to stop\nhim. Besides, any employee with computer access at the IRS or the Social\nSecurity Administration can look your salary up. I sure didn’t want to tip\nmy hand by letting him know I’d found out what he was up to. My main\ngoal at the time was maintaining a low profile, and a good social engineer\ndoesn’t advertise his abilities and knowledge. You always want people to\nunderestimate you, not see you as a threat.\nSo I let it go, and laughed to myself that Joe thought he knew some secret\nabout me, when it was the other way around: I had the upper hand by\nknowing what he had been up to.\nIn time I discovered that all three of my co-workers in the IT group\namused themselves by looking up the take-home pay of this or that cute\nsecretary or (for the one girl in the group) neat-looking guy they had\nspotted. And they were all finding out the salary and bonuses of anybody\nat the company they were curious about, including senior management.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThis story illustrates an interesting problem. The payroll files were\naccessible to the people who had the responsibility of maintaining the\ncompany’s computer systems. So it all comes down to a personnel issue:\ndeciding who can be trusted. In some cases, IT staff might find it\nirresistible to snoop around. And they have the ability to do so because\nthey have privileges allowing them to bypass access controls on those\nfiles.\nOne safeguard would be to audit any access to particularly sensitive files,\nsuch as payroll. Of course, anyone with the requisite privileges could\ndisable auditing or possibly remove any entries that would point back to\nthem, but each additional step takes more effort to hide on the part of an\nunscrupulous employee.\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nFrom pawing through your trash to duping a security guard or\nreceptionist, social engineers can physically invade your corporate space.\nBut you’ll be glad to hear that there are preventive measures you can take.\nProtection After Hours\nAll employees who arrive for work without their badges should be\nrequired to stop at the lobby desk or security office to obtain a temporary\nbadge for the day. The incident in the first story of this chapter could have\ncome to a much different conclusion if the company security guards had\nhad a specific set of steps to follow when encountering anyone without\nthe required employee badge.\nFor companies or areas within a company where security is not a high-\nlevel concern, it may not be important to insist that every person have a\nbadge visible at all times. But in companies with sensitive areas, this\nshould be a standard requirement, rigidly enforced. Employees must be\ntrained and motivated to challenge people who do not display a badge,\nand higher-level employees must be taught to accept such challenges\nwithout causing embarrassment to the person who stops them.\nCompany policy should advise employees of the penalties for those who\nconsistently fail to wear their badges; penalties might include sending the\nemployee home for the day without pay, or a notation in his personnel\nfile. Some companies institute a series of progressively more stringent\npenalties that may include reporting the problem to the person’s manager,\nthen issuing a formal warning.\nIn addition, where there is sensitive information to protect, the company\nshould establish procedures for authorizing people who need to visit\nduring non-business hours. One solution: require that arrangements be\nmade through corporate security or some other designated group. This\ngroup would routinely verify the identity of any employee calling to\narrange an off-hours visit by a call back to the person’s supervisor or some\nother reasonably secure method.\nTreating Trash with Respect\nThe Dumpster-diving story dug into the potential misuses of your\ncorporate trash. The eight keys to wisdom regarding trash:\nClassify all sensitive information based on the degree of sensitivity.\nEstablish company-wide procedures for discarding sensitive information.\nInsist that all sensitive information to be discarded first be shredded, and\nprovide for a safe way for getting rid of important information on scraps\nof paper too small for shredding. Shredders must not be the low-end\nbudget type, which turn out strips of paper that a determined attacker,\ngiven enough patience, can reassemble. Instead, they need to be the kind\ncalled cross-shredders, or those that render the output into useless pulp.\nProvide a way for rendering unusable or completely erasing computer\nmedia--floppy disks, Zip disks, CDs and DVDs used for storing files,\nremovable tapes, old hard drives, and other computer media--before they\nare discarded. Remember that deleting files does not actually remove\nthem; they can still be recovered--as Enron executives and many others\nhave learned to their dismay. Merely dropping computer media in the\ntrash is an invitation to your local friendly Dumpster diver. (See Chapter\n16 for specific guidelines on disposal of media and devices.)\nMaintain an appropriate level of control over the selection of people on\nyour cleaning crews, using background checks if appropriate.\nRemind employees periodically to think about the nature of the materials\nthey are tossing into the trash.\nLock trash Dumpsters.\nUse separate disposal containers for sensitive materials, and contract to\nhave the materials disposed of by a bonded company that specializes in\nthis work.\nSaying Good-Bye to Employees\nThe point has been made earlier in these pages about the need for ironclad\nprocedures when a departing employee has had access to sensitive\ninformation, passwords, dial-in numbers, and the like. Your security\nprocedures need to provide a way to keep track of who has authorization\nto various systems. It may be tough to keep a determined social engineer\nfrom slipping past your security barriers, but don’t make it easy for an ex-\nemployee.\nAnother step easily overlooked: When an employee who was authorized\nto retrieve backup tapes from storage leaves, a written policy must call for\nthe storage company to be immediately notified to remove her name from\nits authorization list.\nChapter 16 of this book provides .detailed information on this vital\nsubject, but it will be helpful to list here some of the key security\nprovisions that should be in place, as highlighted by this story:\nA complete and thorough checklist of steps to be taken upon the\ndeparture of an employee, with special provisions for workers who had\naccess to sensitive data.\nA policy of terminating the employee’s computer access immediately--\npreferably before the person has even left the building.\nA procedure to recover the person’s ID badge, as well as any keys or\nelectronic access devices.\nProvisions that require security guards to see photo ID before admitting\nany employee who does not have his or her security pass, and for\nchecking the name against a list to verify that the person is still employed\nby the organization.\nSome further steps will seem excessive or too expensive for some\ncompanies, but they are appropriate to others. Among these more\nstringent security measures are:\nElectronic ID badges combined with scanners at entrances; each\nemployee swipes his badge through the scanner for an instantaneous\nelectronic determination that the person is still a current employee and\nentitled to enter the building. (Note, however, that security guards must\nstill be trained to be on the alert for piggybacking--an unauthorized person\nslipping by in the wake of a legitimate employee.)\nA requirement that all employees in the same workgroup as the person\nleaving (especially if the person is being fired) change their passwords.\n(Does this seem extreme? Many years after my short time working at\nGeneral Telephone, I learned that the Pacific Bell security people, when\nthey heard General\nTelephone had hired me, \"rolled on the ground with laughter.\" But to\nGeneral Telephone’s credit when they realized they had\na reputed hacker working for them after they laid me off, they then\nrequired that passwords be changed for everyone in the company!)\nYou don’t want your facilities to feel like jails, but at the same time you\nneed to defend against the guy who was fired yesterday but is back today\nintent on doing damage.\nDon’t Forget Anybody\nSecurity policies tend to overlook the entry-level worker, people like\nreceptionists who don’t handle sensitive corporate information. We’ve\nseen elsewhere that receptionists are a handy target for attackers, and the\nstory of the break-in at the auto parts company provides another example:\nA friendly person, dressed like a professional, who claims to be a\ncompany employee from another facility may not be what he appears.\nReceptionists need to be well-trained about politely asking for company\nID when appropriate, and the training needs to be not just for the main\nreceptionist but also for everyone who sits in as relief at the reception\ndesk during lunchtime or coffee breaks.\nFor visitors from outside the company, the policy should require that a\nphoto ID be shown and the information recorded. It isn’t hard to get fake\nID, but at least demanding ID makes pre-texting one degree harder for the\nwould-be attacker.\nIn some companies, it makes sense to follow a policy requiring that\nvisitors be escorted from the lobby and from meeting to meeting.\nProcedures should require that the escort make clear when delivering the\nvisitor to his first appointment that this person has entered the building as\nan employee , or non-employee. Why is this important? Because, as we’ve\nseen in earlier\nstories, an attacker will often pass himself off in one guise to the first\nperson encountered, and as someone else to the next. It’s too easy for an\nattacker to show up in the lobby, convince the receptionist that he has an\nappointment with, say, an engineer.., then be escorted to the engineer’s\noffice where he claims to be a rep from a company that wants to sell some\nproduct to the company.., and then, after the meeting with the engineer, he\nhas free access to roam the building.\nBefore admitting an off-site employee to the premises, suitable procedures\nmust be followed to verify that the person is truly an employee;\nreceptionists and guards must be aware of methods used by attackers to\npretext the identity of an employee in order to gain access to company\nbuildings.\nHow about protecting against the attacker who cons his way inside the\nbuilding and manages to plug his laptop into a network port behind the\ncorporate firewall? Given today’s technology, this is a challenge:\nconference rooms, training rooms, and similar areas should not leave\nnetwork ports unsecured but should protect them with firewalls or routers.\nBut better protection would come from the use of a secure method to\nauthenticate any users who connect to the network.\nSecure IT!\nA word to the wise: In your own company, every worker in IT probably\nknows or can find out in moments how much you are earning, how much\nthe CEO takes home, and who’s using the corporate jet to go on skiing\nvacations.\nIt’s even possible in some companies for IT people or accounting people\nto increase their own salaries, make payments to a phony vendor, remove\nnegative ratings from HR records, and so on. Sometimes it’s only the fear\nof getting caught that keeps them honest.., and then one day along comes\nsomebody whose greed or native dishonesty makes him (or\nher) ignore the risk and take whatever he thinks he can get away with.\nThere are solutions, of course. Sensitive files can be protected by\ninstalling proper access controls so that only authorized people can open\nthem. Some operating systems have audit controls that can be configured\nto maintain a log of certain events, such as each person who attempts to\naccess a protected file, regardless of whether or not the attempt succeeds.\nIf your company has understood this issue and has implemented proper\naccess controls and auditing that protects sensitive files--you’re taking\npowerful steps in the right direction.",
    "question": "What are the key tactics and methods used by social engineers to gain access to sensitive information and systems within an organization?",
    "summary": "Social engineering exploits human vulnerabilities, such as trust and lack of critical thinking, to gain access to sensitive information. Employees often fall for tactics like sympathy, guilt, or deception, especially when they don't fully understand the risks. Preventing such attacks requires clear security policies, verification procedures for sensitive data, and training employees to recognize and resist social engineering attempts. Additionally, securing systems, using strong passwords, and protecting physical access points are essential to safeguarding company information."

    "text": "Chapter 11\nCombining Technology and Social Engineering\nA social engineer lives by his ability to manipulate people into doing\nthings that help him achieve his goal, but success often also requires a\nlarge measure of knowledge and skill with computer systems and\ntelephone systems.\nHere’s a sampling of typical social engineering scams where technology\nplayed an important role.\n\nHACKING BEHIND BARS\nWhat are some of the most secure installations you can think of, protected\nagainst break-in, whether physical, telecommunications, or electronic in\nnature? Fort Knox? Sure. The White House? Absolutely. NORAD, the\nNorth American Air Defense installation buried deep under a mountain?\nMost definitely.\nHow about federal prisons and detention centers? They must be about as\nsecure as any place in the country, right? People rarely escape, and when\nthey do, they are normally caught in short order. You would think that a\nfederal facility would be invulnerable to social engineering attacks. But\nyou would be wrong--there is no such thing as foolproof security,\nanywhere.\nA few years ago, a pair of grifters (professional swindlers) ran into a\nproblem. It turned out they had lifted a large bundle of cash from a local\njudge. The pair had been in trouble with the law on and off through the\nyears, but this time the federal authorities took an interest. They nabbed\none of the grifters, Charles Gondorff, and tossed him into a correctional\ncenter near San Diego. The federal magistrate ordered him detained as\nflight risk and a danger to the community.\nHis pal Johnny Hooker knew that Charlie was going to need a defense\nattorney. But where was the money going to come from? most grifters,\ntheir money had always gone for good clothes, fancy cam and the ladies\nas fast as it came in. Johnny larely had enough to live on.\nThe money for a good lawyer would have to come from running another\nscam. Johnny wasn’t up to doing this on this own. Charlie Gondorff had\nalways been the brains behind their cons. But Johnny didn’t dare visit the\ndetention center to ask Charlie what to do, not when the Feds knew there\nhad been two men involved in the scam and were so eager to lay their\nhands on the other one. Especially since only family can visit. which\nmeant he’d have to show fake identification and claim to be a family\nmember. Trying to use fake ID in a federal prison didn’t sound like a\nsmart idea.\nNo, he’d have to get in touch with Gondorff some other way.\nIt wouldn’t be easy. No inmate in any federal, state, or local facility is\nallowed to receive phone calls. A sign posted by every inmate telephone\nin\na federal detention center says something like, \"This notice is to advise\nthe\nuser that all conversations from this telephone are subject to monitoring.\nand the use of the telephone constitutes consent to the monitoring.\nHaving government officials listen in on your phone calls while\ncommitting\na crime has a way of extending your federally funded vacation plans.\nJohnny knew, though, that certain phone calls were not monitored: calls\nbetween a prisoner and his attorney, protected by the Constitution as\nclient-attorney communications, for example. In fact, the facility where\nGondorff was being held had telephones connected directly to the federal\nPublic Defender’s Office. Pick up one of those phones, and a direct\nconnection\nis made to the corresponding telephone in the PDO. The phone\ncompany calls this service Direct Connect. The unsuspecting authorities\nassume the service is secure and invulnerable to tampering because\noutgoing\ncalls can only go to the PDO, and incoming calls are blocked. Even if\nsomeone were somehow able to find out the phone number, the phones\nare programmed in the telephone company switch as deny terminate,\nwhich is a clumsy phone company term for service where incoming calls\nare not permitted.\nSince any halfway decent grifter is well versed in the art of\ndeception,\nJohnny figured there had to be a way around this\nproblem. From the\ninside, Gondorff had already tried picking up one of\nthe PDO phones and\nsaying, \"This is Tom, at the phone company repair\ncenter.\n\nLINGO\nDIRECT CONNECT Phone company term for a phone line that goes\ndirectly to a specific number when picked up\nDENY TERMINATE A phone company service option where switching\nequipment is set that incoming calls cannot be received at a phone number\nWe’re running a test on this line and I need you to try dialing nine, and\nthen zero-zero.\" The nine would have accessed an outside line, the zero-\nzero would then have reached a long-distance operator. It didn’t work the\nperson answering the phone at the PDO was already hip to that trick.\nJohnny was having better success. He readily found out that there were\nten housing units in the detention center, each with a direct connect\ntelephone line to the Public Defender’s Office. Johnny encountered some\nobstacles, but like a social engineer, he was able to think his way around\nthese annoying stumbling blocks. Which unit was Gondorff in? What was\nthe telephone number to the direct connect services in that housing unit?\nAnd how would he initially get a message to Gondorff without it being\nintercepted by prison officials?\nWhat may appear to be the impossible to average folks, like obtaining the\nsecret telephone numbers located in federal institutions, is very often no\nmore than a few phone calls away for a con artist. After a couple of\ntossing-and-turning nights brainstorming a plan, Johnny woke up one\nmormng with the whole thing laid out in his mind, in five steps.\nFirst, he’d find out the phone numbers for those ten direct-connect\ntelephones to the PDO.\nHe’d have all ten changed so that the phones would allow incoming calls.\nHe’d find out which housing unit Gondorff was on.\nThen he’d find out which phone number went to that unit.\nFinally, he’d arrange with Gondorff when to expect his call, without the\ngovernment suspecting a thing.\nPiece a’ cake, he thought.\nCalling Ma Bell...\nJohnny began by calling the phone company business office under the\npretext of being from the General Services Administration, the agency\nresponsible for purchasing goods and services for the federal\ngovernment.\nHe said he was working on an acquisition order for additional\nservices and needed to know the billing information for any\ndirect connect services currently in use, including the working\ntelephone numbers and monthly cost at the San Diego\ndetention center. The lady was happy to help.\nJust to make sure, he tried dialing into one of those lines and\nwas answered by the typical audichron recording, \"This line\nhas been disconnected or is no longer in service\"(cid:151)which he\nknew meant nothing of kind but instead meant that the line\nwas programmed to block incoming calls, just as he expected.\nHe knew from his extensive knowledge of phone company\noperations and procedures that he’d need to reach a department\ncalled the Recent Change Memory Authorization Center or\nRCMAC (I will always wonder who makes up these names!).\nHe began by calling the phone company Business Office, said\nhe was in Repair and needed to know the number for the\nRCMAC that handled the service area for the area code and\nprefix he gave, which was served out of the same central\noffice for all the to telephone lines in the detention center. It\nwas a routine request, the kind provided for technicians out in\nthe field in need of some assistance, and the clerk had no\nhesitation in giving him the number.\nHe called RCMAC, gave a phony name and again said he was\nin Repair\nHe had the lady who answered access one of the telephone\nnumbers he had conned out of the business office a few calls\nearlier; when she had it up, Johnny asked, \"Is the number set\nto deny termination?\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\"Well, that explains why the customer isn’t able to receive\ncalls!\" Johnny said. \"Listen, can you do me a favor. I need you\nto change the line class code or remove the deny terminate\nfeature, okay?\" There was a pause as she checked another\ncomputer system to verify that a service order had been placed\nto authorize the change. She said, \"That number is supposed to\nbe restricted for outgoing calls only. There’s no service order\nfor a change.\"\n\"Right, it’s a mistake. We were supposed to process the order\nyesterday but the regular account rep that handles this\ncustomer went home sick and forgot to have someone else\ntake care of the order for her. So now of course the customer\nis up in arms about it.\"\nAfter a momentary pause while the lady pondered this request,\nwhich would be out of the ordinary and against standard\noperating procedures, she said, \"Okay.\" He could hear her\ntyping, entering the change. And a few seconds later, it was\ndone.\nThe ice had been broken, a kind of collusion established between them.\nReading the woman’s attitude and willingness to help, Johnny didn’t\nhesitate to go for it all. He said, \"Do you have a few minutes more to help\nme?\"\n\"Yeah,\" she answered. \"What do you need?\"\n\"I’ve got a several other lines that belong to the same customer, and all\nhave the same problem. I’ll read off the numbers, so you can make sure\nthat they’re not set for deny terminate--okay?\" She said that was fine.\nA few minutes later, all ten phone lines had been \"fixed\" to accept\nincoming calls.\nFinding Gondorff\nNext, find out what housing unit Gondorff was on. This is information\nthat the people who run detention centers and prisons definitely don’t want\noutsiders to know. Once again Johnny had to rely on his social\nengineering skills.\nHe placed a call to a federal prison in another city--he called Miami,\nbut any one would have worked--and claimed he was calling from the\ndetention center in New York. He asked to talk to somebody who worked\nwith the Bureau’s Sentry computer, the computer system that contains\ninformation on every prisoner being held in a Bureau of Prisons facility\nanywhere in the country.\nWhen that person came on the phone, Johnny put on his Brooklyn accent.\n\"Hi,\" he said. \"This is Thomas at the FDC New York. Our connection to\nSentry keeps going down, can you find the location of a prisoner for me, I\nthink this prisoner may be at your institution,\" and gave Gondorff’s name\nand his registration number.\n\"No, he’s not here,\" the guy said after a couple of moments. \"He’s at the\ncorrectional center in San Diego.\"\nJohnny pretended to be surprised. \"San Diego! He was supposed to be\ntransferred to Miami on the Marshal’s airlift last week! Are we talking\nabout the same guy--what’s the guy’s DOB?\"\n12/3/60,\" the man read from his screen.\n\"Yeah, that’s the same guy. What housing unit is he on?\"\n\"He’s on Ten North,\" the man said--blithely answering the question\neven though there isn’t any conceivable reason why a prison employee in\nNew York would need to know this.\nJohnny now had the phones turned on for incoming calls, and knew which\nhousing unit Gondorff was on. Next, find out which phone number\nconnected to unit Ten North.\nThis one was a bit difficult. Johnny called one of the numbers. He knew\nthe ringer of the phone would be turned off; no one would know it was\nringing. So he sat there reading Fodor’s Europe} Great Cities travel guide.\nwhile listening to the constant ringing on speakerphone until finally\nsomebody picked up. The inmate on the other end would, of course, be\ntrying to reach his court-appointed lawyer. Johnny was prepared with the\nexpected response. \"Public Defender’s Office,\" he announced.\nWhen the man asked for his attorney, Johnny said, \"I’ll see if he’s\navailable, what housing unit are you calling from?\" He jotted down the\nman’s answer, clicked onto hold, came back after half a minute and said,\n\"He’s in court, you’ll have to call back later,\" and hung up.\nHe had spent the better part of a morning, but it could have been worse;\nhis fourth attempt turned out to be from Ten North. So Johnny now knew\nthe phone number to the PDO phone on Gondorff’s housing unit.\nSynchronize Your Watches\nNow to get a message through to Gondorff on when to pick up the\ntelephone line that connects inmates directly to the Public Defender’s\nOffice. ]’his was easier than it might sound.\nJohnny called the detention center using his official-sounding voice,\nidentified himself as an employee, and asked to be transferred to Ten\nNorth. The call was put right through. When the correctional officer there\npicked up, Johnny conned him by using the insider’s abbreviation for\nReceiving and Discharge, the unit that processes new inmates in, and\ndeparting ones out: \"This is Tyson in R&D,\" he said. \"I need to speak to\ninmate Gondorff. We have some property of his we have to ship and we\nneed an address where he wants it sent. Could you call him to the phone\nfor me?\"\nJohnny could hear the guard shouting across the day room. After an\nimpatient several minutes, a familiar voice came on the line.\nJohnny told him, \"Don’t say anything until I explain what this is.\" He\nexplained the pretext so Johnny could sound like he was discussing where\nhis property should be shipped. Johnny then said, \"If you can get to the\nPublic Defender phone at one this afternoon, don’t respond. If you can’t,\nthen say a time that you can be there.\" Gondorff didn’t reply. Johnny went\non, \"Good. Be there at one o’clock. I’ll call you then. Pick up the phone.\nIf it starts to ring to the Public Defenders Office, flash the switch hook\nevery twenty seconds. Keep trying till you hear me on the other end.\"\nAt one o’clock, Gondorff picked up the phone, and Johnny was there\nwaiting for him. They had a chatty, enjoyable, unhurried conversation,\nleading to a series of similar calls to plan the scam that would raise the\nmoney to pay Gondorff’s legal fees--all free from government\nsurveillance.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThis episode offers a prime example of how a social engineer can make\nthe seemingly impossible happen by conning several people, each one\ndoing something that, by itself, seems inconsequential. In reality, each\naction provides one small piece of the puzzle until the con is complete.\nThe first phone company employee thought she was giving information\nto someone from the federal government’s General Accounting Office.\nThe next phone company employee knew she wasn’t supposed to change\nthe class of telephone service without a service order, but helped out the\nfriendly man anyway. This made it possible to place calls through to all\nten of the public defender phone lines in the detention center.\nFor the man at the detention center in Miami, the request to help someone\nat another federal facility with a computer problem seemed perfectly\nreasonable. And even though there didn’t seem any reason he would want\nto know the housing unit, why not answer the question?\nAnd the guard on Ten North who believed that the caller was really from\nwithin the same facility, calling on official business? It was a perfectly\nreasonable request, so he called the inmate Gondorff to the telephone. No\nbig deal.\nA series of well-planned stories that added up to completing the sting.\n\nTHE SPEEDY DOWNLOAD\nTen years after they had finished law school, Ned Racine saw his\nclassmates living in nice homes with front lawns, belonging to country\nclubs, playing golf once or twice a week, while he was still handling\npenny-ante cases for the kind of people who never had enough money to\npay his bill. Jealousy can be a nasty companion. Finally one day, Ned had\nhad enough.\nThe one good client he ever had was a small but very successful\naccounting firm that specialized in mergers and acquisitions. They hadn’t\nused Ned for long, just long enough for him to realize they were involved\nin\ndeals that, once they hit the newspapers, would affect the stock price of\none or two publicly traded companies. Penny-ante, bulletin-board stocks,\nbut in some ways that was even better--a small jump in price could\nrepresent a big percentage gain on an investment. If he could only tap into\ntheir files and find out what they were working on...\nHe knew a man who knew a man who was wise about things not exactly\nin the mainstream. The man listened to the plan, got fired up and agreed to\nhelp. For a smaller fee than he usually charged, against a percentage of\nNed’s stock market killing, the man gave Ned instructions on what to do.\nHe also gave him a handy little device to use, something brand-new on the\nmarket.\nFor a few days in a row Ned kept watch on the parking lot of the small\nbusiness park where the accounting company had its unpretentious,\nstorefront-like offices. Most people left between 5:30 and 6. By 7, the lot\nwas empty. The cleaning crew showed up around 7:30. Perfect.\nThe next night at a few minutes before 8 o’clock, Ned parked across the\nstreet from the parking lot. As he expected, the lot was empty except for\nthe truck from the janitorial services company. Ned put his ear to the door\nand heard the vacuum cleaner running. He knocked at the door very\nloudly, and stood there waiting in his suit and tie, holding his well-worn\nbriefcase. No answer, but he was patient. He knocked again. A man from\nthe cleaning crew finally appeared. \"Hi,\" Ned shouted through the glass\ndoor, showing the business card of one of the partners that he had picked\nup some time earlier. \"I locked my keys in my car and I need to get to my\ndesk.\"\nThe man unlocked the door, locked it again behind Ned, and then went\ndown the corridor turning on lights so Ned could see where he was going.\nAnd why not--he was being kind to one of the people who helped put food\non his table. Or so he had every reason to think.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nIndustrial spies and computer intruders will sometimes make a physical\nentry into the targeted business. Rather than using a crowbar to break in,\nthe social engineer uses the art of deception to influence the person on the\nother side of the door to open up for him.\nNed sat down at the computer of one of the partners, and turned it on.\nWhile it was starting up, he installed the small device he had been given\ninto the USB port of the computer, a gadget small enough to carry on a\nkey ring, yet able to hold more than 120 megabytes of data. He logged\ninto the network with the username and password of the partner’s\nsecretary, which were conveniently written down on a Post-it note stuck\nto the display. In less than five minutes, Ned had downloaded every\nspreadsheet and document file stored on the workstation and from the\npartner’s network directory and was on his way home.\n\nEASY MONEY\nWhen I was first introduced to computers in high school, we had to\nconnect over a modem to one central DEC PDP 11 minicomputer in\ndowntown Los Angeles that all the high schools in L.A. shared. The\noperating system on that computer was called RSTS/E, and it was the\noperating system I first learned to work with.\nAt that time, in 1981, DEC sponsored an annual conference for its product\nusers, and one year I read that the conference was going to be held in L.A.\nA popular magazine for users of this operating system carried an\nannouncement about a new security product, LOCK-11. The product was\nbeing promoted with a clever ad campaign that said something like, \"It’s\n3:30 ,.M. and Johnny down the street found your dial-in number, 555-\n0336, on his 336th try. He’s in and you’re out. Get LOCK-11.\" The\nproduct, the ad suggested, was hacker-proof. And it was going to be on\ndisplay at the conference.\nI was eager to see the product for myself. A high school buddy and friend,\nVinny, my hacking partner for several years who later became a federal\ninformant against me, shared my interest in the new DEC product, and\nencouraged me to go to the conference with him.\nCash on the Line\nWe arrived to find a big buzz already going around the crowd at the trade\nshow about LOCK-11. It seemed that the developers were staking cash on\nthe line in a bet that no one could break into their product. Sounded like a\nchallenge I could not resist.\nWe headed straight for the LOCK-11 booth and found it manned by\nthree guys who were the developers of the product; I recognized them and\nthey recognized me--even as a teen, I already had a reputation as a\nphreaker and hacker because of a big story the LA Times had run about\nmy first juvenile brush with the authorities. The article reported that I had\ntalked my way into a Pacific Telephone building in the middle of the\nnight and walked out with computer manuals, right under the nose of their\nsecurity guard. (It appears the Times wanted to run a sensationalist story\nand it served their purposes to publish my name; because I was still a\njuvenile, the article violated the custom if not the law of withholding the\nnames of minors accused of wrongdoing.)\nWhen Vinny and I walked up, ir created some interest on both sides.\nThere was an interest on their side because they recognized me as the\nhacker they had read about and they were a bit shocked to see me. It\ncreated an interest on our side because each of the three developers was\nstanding there with a $100 bill sticking out of his tradeshow badge. The\nprize money for anybody who could defeat their system would be the\nwhole $300--which sounded like a lot of money to a pair of teenagers. We\ncould hardly wait to get started.\nLOCK-11 was designed on an established principle that relied on two\nlevels of security. A user had to have a valid ID and password, as usual,\nbut in addition that ID and password would only work when entered from\nauthorized terminals, an approach called terminal-based security. To\ndefeat the system, a hacker would need not only to have knowledge of an\naccount ID and password, but would also have to enter that information\nfrom the correct terminal. The method was well established, and the\ninventors of LOCK-11 were convinced it would keep the bad guys out.\nWe decided we were going to teach them a lesson, and earn three hundred\nbucks to boot.\nA guy I knew who was considered an RSTS/E guru had already beaten us\nto the booth. Years before he had been one of the guys who had\nchallenged me to break into the DEC internal development computer,\nafter which his associates had turned me in. Since those days he had\nbecome a respected programmer. We found out that he had tried to defeat\nthe LOCK-11 security program not long before we arrived, but had been\nunable to. The incident had given the developers greater confidence that\ntheir product really was secure.\n\nLINGO\nTERMINAL-BASED SECURITY Security based in part on the\nidentification of the particular computer terminal being used; this method\nof security was especially popular with IBM mainframe computers.\nThe contest was a straightforward challenge: You break in, you win the\nbucks. A good publicity stunt.., unless somebody was able to embarrass\nthem and take the money. They were so sure of their product that they\nwere even audacious enough to have a printout posted at the booth giving\nthe account numbers and corresponding passwords to some accounts on\nthe system. And not just regular user accounts, but all the privileged\naccounts.\nThat was actually less daring than it sounds: In this type of set-up, I knew,\neach terminal is plugged into a port on the computer itself. It wasn’t rocket\nscience to figure out they had set up the five terminals in the conference\nhall so a visitor could log in only as a non-privileged user--that is, logins\nwere possible only to accounts without system administrator privileges. It\nlooked as if there were only two routes: either bypass the security\nsoftware altogether--exactly what the LOCK-11 was designed to prevent;\nor somehow get around the software in a way that the developers hadn’t\nimagined.\nTaking Up the Challenge\nVinny and I walked away and talked about the challenge, and I came up\nwith a plan. We wandered around innocently, keeping an eye on the booth\nfrom a distance. At lunchtime, when the crowd thinned out, the three\ndevelopers took advantage of the break and took off together to get\nsomething to eat, leaving behind a woman who might have been the wife\nor girlfriend of one of them. We sauntered back over and I distracted the\nwoman, chatting her up about this and that, \"How long have you been\nwith the company? \"What other products does your company have on the\nmarket?\" and so on.\nMeanwhile Vinny, out of her sight line, had gone to work, making use of\na skill he and I had both developed. Besides the fascination of breaking\ninto computers, and my own interest in magic, we had both been intrigued\nby learning how to open locks. As a young kid, I had scoured the shelves\nof an underground bookstore in the San Fernando Valley that had\nvolumes on picking locks, getting out of handcuffs, creating fake\nidentities--all kinds of things a kid was not supposed to know about.\nVinny, like me, had practiced lock-picking until we were pretty good with\nany run-of-the-mill hardware-store lock. There had been a time when I got\na kick out of pranks involving locks, like spotting somebody who was\nusing two locks for extra protection, picking the locks, and put-ring them\nback in the opposite places, which would baffle and frustrate the owner\nwhen he tried to open each with the wrong key.\nIn the exhibit hall, I continued to keep the young woman distracted while\nVinny, squatting down at the back of the booth so he couldn’t be\nseen, picked the lock on the cabinet that housed their PDP-11\nminicomputer and the cable terminations. To call the cabinet locked was\nalmost a joke. It was secured with what locksmiths refer to as a wafer\nlock, notoriously easy to pick, even for fairly clumsy, amateur lock-\npickers like us.\nIt took Vinny all of about a minute to open the lock. Inside the cabinet he\nfound just what we had anticipated: the strip of ports for plugging in user\nterminals, and one port for what’s called the console terminal. This was\nthe terminal used by the computer operator or system administrator to\ncontrol all the computers. Vinny plugged the cable leading from the\nconsole port into one of the terminals on the show floor.\nThat meant this one terminal was now recognized as a console terminal. I\nsat down at the recabled machine and logged in using a password the\ndevelopers had so audaciously provided. Because the LOCK-11 software\nnow identified that I was logging in from an authorized terminal, it\ngranted me access, and I was connected with system administrator\nprivileges. I patched the operating system by changing it so that from any\nof the terminals on the floor, I would be able to log in as a privileged user.\nOnce my secret patch was installed, Vinny went back to work\ndisconnecting the terminal cable plugging it back in where it had been\noriginally. Then he picked the lock once again, this time to fasten the\ncabinet door closed.\nI did a directory listing to find out what files were on the computer,\nlooking for the LocK-11 program and associated files and stumbled on\nsomething I found shocking: a directory that should not have been on this\nmachine. The developers had been so overconfident, so certain their\nsoftware was invincible, that they hadn’t bothered to remove the source\ncode of their new product. Moving to the adjacent hard-copy terminal, I\nstarted printing out portions of the source code onto the continuous sheets\nof the green-striped computer paper used in those days.\nVinny had only just barely finished picking the lock closed and rejoined\nme when the guys returned from lunch. They found me sitting at the\ncomputer pounding the keys while the printer continued to churn away.\n\"What’cha doing, Kevin?\" one of them asked.\n\"Oh, just printing out your source code,\" I said. They assumed I was\njoking, of course. Until they looked at the printer and saw that it really u,\nas the jealously guarded source code for their product.\nThey didn’t believe it was possible that I was logged in as a privileged\nuser. \"Type a Control-T,\" one of the developers commanded. I did. The\ndisplay that appeared on the screen confirmed my claim. The guy\nsmacked his forehead, as Vinny said, \"Three hundred dollars, please.\"\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nHere’s another example of smart people underestimating the enemy. How\nabout you--are you so certain about your company’s security safeguards\nthat you would bet $300 against an attacker breaking in? Sometimes the\nway around a technological security device is not the one you expect.\nThey paid up. Vinny and I walked around the tradeshow floor for the rest\nof the day with the hundred-dollar bills stuck into our conference badges.\nEveryone who saw the bills knew what they represented.\nOf course, Vinny and I hadn’t defeated their software, and if the developer\nteam had thought to set better rules for the contest, or had used a really\nsecure lock, or had watched their equipment more carefully, they wouldn’t\nhave suffered the humiliation of that day--humiliation at the hands of a\npair of teenagers.\nI found out later that the developer team had to stop by a bank to get some\ncash: those hundred-dollar bills represented all the spending money they\nhad brought with them.\n\nTHE DICTIONARY AS AN ATTACK TOOL\nWhen someone obtains your password, he’s able to invade your system. In\nmost circumstances, you never even know that anything bad has\nhappened.\nA young attacker I’ll call Ivan Peters had a target of retrieving the source\ncode for a new electronic game. He had no trouble getting into the\ncompany’s wide area network, because a hacker buddy of his had already\ncompromised one of the company’s Web servers. After finding an un-\npatched vulnerability in the Web server software, his buddy had just about\nfallen out of his chair when he realized the system had been set up as a\ndual-homed host, which meant he had an entry point into the internal\nnetwork. .\nBut once Ivan was connected, he then faced a challenge that was like\nbeing inside the Louvre and hoping to find the Mona Lisa. Without a floor\nplan, you could wander for weeks. The company was global, with\nhundreds of offices and thousands of computer servers, and they didn’t\nexactly provide an index of development systems or the services of a tour\nguide to steer him to the right one.\nInstead of using a technical approach to finding out what server he needed\nto target, Ivan used a social engineering approach. He placed phone calls\nbased on methods similar to those described elsewhere in this\nbook. First, calling IT technical support, he claimed to be a company\nemployee having an interface issue on a product his group was designing.\nand asked for the phone number of the project leader for the gaming\ndevelopment team.\nThen he called the name he’d been given, posing as a guy from IT. \"Later\ntonight,\" he said, \"we’re swapping out a router and need to make sure the\npeople on your team don’t lose connectivity to your server. So we need to\nknow which servers your team uses.\" The network was being upgraded all\nthe time. And giving the name of the server wouldn’t hurt anything\nanyway, now would it? Since it was password-protected, just having the\nname couldn’t help anybody break in. So the guy gave the attacker the\nserver name. Didn’t even bother to call the man back to verify his story, or\nwrite down his name and phone number. He just gave the name of the\nservers, ATM5 and ATM6.\nThe Password Attack\nAt this point, Ivan switched to a technical approach to get the\nauthentication information. The first step with most technical attacks on\nsystems that provide remote access capability is to identify an account\nwith a weak password, which provides an initial entry point into the\nsystem.\nWhen an attacker attempts to use hacking tools for remotely identifying\npasswords, the effort may require him to stay connected to the company’s\nnetwork for hours at a time. Clearly he does this at his peril: The longer he\nstays connected, the greater the risk of detection and getting caught.\nAs a preliminary step, Ivan would do an enumeration, which reveals\ndetails about a target system. Once again the Internet conveniently\nprovides software for the purpose (at http://ntsleuth.0catch.com; the\ncharacter before \"catch\" is a zero). Ivan found several publicly available\nhacking tools on the Web that automated the enumeration process,\navoiding the need to do it by hand, which would take longer and thus run\na higher risk. Knowing that the organization mostly deployed Windows-\nbased servers, he downloaded a copy of NBTEnum, a NetBIOS (basic\ninput/output system) enumeration utility. He entered the IP (Internet\nprotocol) address of the ATM5 server, and started running the program.\nThe enumeration tool was able to identify several accounts that existed on\nthe server.\n\nLINGO\nENUMERATION A process that reveals the service enabled on the\ntarget system, the operating system platform, and a list of accounts names\nof the users who have access to the system.\nOnce the existing accounts had been identified, the same enumeration tool\nhad the ability to launch a dictionary attack against the computer system.\nA dictionary attack is something that many computer security folks and\nintruders are intimately familiar with, but that most other people will\nprobably be shocked to learn is possible. Such an attack is aimed at\nuncovering the password of each user on the system by using commonly\nused words.\nWe’re all lazy about some things, but it never ceases to amaze me that\nwhen people choose their passwords, their creativity and imagination\nseem to disappear. Most of us want a password that gives us protection\nbut that is at the same time easy to remember, which usually means\nsomething closely connected to us. Our initials, middle name, nickname,\nspouse’s name, favorite song, movie, or brew, for example. The name of\nthe street we live on or the town we live in, the kind of car we drive, the\nbeachfront village we like to stay at in Hawaii, or that favorite stream with\nthe best trout fishing around. Recognize the pattern here? These are\nmostly personal names, place names, or dictionary words. A dictionary\nattack runs through common words at a very rapid pace, trying each as a\npassword on one or more user accounts.\nIvan ran the dictionary attack in three phases. For the first, he used a\nsimple list of some 800 of the most common passwords; the list includes\nsecret, work, and password. Also the program permutated the dictionary\nwords to try each word with an appended digit, or appending the number\nof the current month. The program tried each attempt against all of the\nuser accounts that had been identified. No luck.\nFor the next attempt, Ivan went to Google’s search engine and typed,\n\"wordlists dictionaries,\" and found thousands of sites with extensive\nwordlists and dictionaries for English and several foreign languages. He\ndownloaded an entire electronic English dictionary. He then enhanced this\nby downloading a number of word lists that he found with Google. Ivan\nchose the site at www.outpost9.com/files/WordLists.html.\nThis site allowed him to download (all of this for free) a selection of files\nincluding family names, given namek, congressional names and words,\nactor’s names, and words and names from the Bible.\nAnother of the many sites offering word lists is actually provided through\nOxford University, at ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists.\nOther sites offer lists with the names of cartoon characters, words used in\nShakespeare, in the Odyssey, Tolkien, and the Star Trek series, as well as\nin science and religion, and on and on. (One on-line company sells a list\ncontaining 4.4 million words and names for only $20.) The attack\nprogram can be set to test the anagrams of the dictionary words, as well--\nanother favorite method that many computer users think increases their\nsafety.\nFaster Than You Think\nOnce Ivan had decided which wordlist to use, and started the attack, the\nsoftware ran on autopilot. He was able to turn his attention to other things.\nAnd here’s the incredible part: You would think such an attack would\nallow the hacker to take a Rip van Winkle snooze and the software would\nstill have made little progress when he awoke. In fact, depending on the\nplatform being attacked, the security configuration of the system, and\nnetwork connectivity, every word in an English dictionary can, incredibly,\nbe attempted in less than thirty minutes!\nWhile this attack was running, Ivan started another computer running a\nsimilar attack on the other server used by the development group, ATM6.\nTwenty minutes later, the attack software had done what most\nunsuspecting users like to think is impossible: It had broken a password,\nrevealing that one of the users had chosen the password \"Frodo,\" one of\nthe Hobbits in the book The Lord of the Rings.\nWith this password in hand, Ivan was able to connect to the ATM6 server\nusing the user’s account.\nThere was good news and bad news for our attacker. The good news was\nthat the account he cracked had administrator privileges, which would be\nessential for the next step. The bad news was that the source code for the\ngame was not anywhere to be found. It must be, after all, on the other\nmachine, the ATM5, which he already knew was resistant to a dictionary\nattack. But Ivan wasn’t giving up just yet; he still had a few more tricks to\ntry.\nOn some Windows and UNIX operating systems, password hashes\n(encrypted passwords) are openly available to anyone who has access to\nthe computer they’re stored on. The reasoning is that the encrypted\npasswords cannot be broken and therefore do not need to be protected.\nThe theory is wrong. Using another tool called pwdump3, also available\non the Internet, he was able to extract the password hashes from the\nATM6 machine and download them.\nA typical file of password hashes looks like this:\nAdministrator:\n500:95E4321A38AD8D6AB75EOC8D76954A50:2E48927AO\n\nBO4F3BFB341E26F6D6E9A97 : : :\nakasper :\n1110:5A8D7E9E3C3954F642C5C736306CBFEF:393CE7F90A8357\n\nF157873D72D0490821: : :\ndigger: 1111:5D15COD58DD216C525AD3B83FA6627C7 :\n17AD564144308B4 2B8403DOIAE256558: : :\nellgan :\n1112:2017D4A5D8D1383EFF17365FAFIFFE89:O7AEC950C22CBB\n9 C2C734EB89320DB13: : :\ntabeck: 1115:9F5890B3FECCAB7EAAD3B435B51404EE:\n1FO115A72844721 2FCO5EID2D820B35B: : :\nvkantar :\n1116:81A6A5DO35596E7DAAD3B435B51404EE:B933D36DD1225\n8 946FCC7BD153F1CD6E : : :\nvwallwick: 1119 :\n25904EC665BA30F4449AF42E1054F192:15B2B7953FB6\n32907455D2706A432469 : : :\nmmcdonald: 1121:A4AEDO98D29A3217AAD3B435B51404EE:\n\nE40670F936B7 9C2ED522F5ECA9398A27 : : :\nkworkman : 1141:C5C598AF45768635AAD3B435B51404EE:\n\nDEC8E827A1212 73EFO84CDBF5FD1925C : : :\nWith the hashes now downloaded to his computer, Ivan used another tool\nthat performed a different flavor of password attack known as brute force.\nThis kind of attack tries every combination of alphanumeric characters\nand most special symbols.\nIvan used a software utility called L0phtcrack3 (pronounced loft-crack;\navailable at www.atstake.com; another source for some excellent\npassword recovery tools is www.elcomsoft.com). System administrators\nuse L0pht-crack3 to audit weak passwords; attackers use it to crack\npasswords. The brute force feature in LC3 tries passwords with\ncombinations of letters, numerals, and most symbols including\n!@#$%^&. It systematically tries every possible combination of most\ncharacters. (Note, however, that if nonprintable characters are used, LC3\nwill be unable to discover the password )\nThe program has a nearly unbelievable speed, which can reach to as high\nas 2.8 million attempts a second on a machine with a 1 GHz processor.\nEven with this speed, and if the system administrator has configured the\nWindows operating system properly (disabling the use of LANMAN\nhashes), breaking a password can still take an excessive amount of time.\n\nLINGO\nBRUTE FORCE ATTACK A password detection stategy that tries\nevery possible combination of alphanumeric characters and special\nsymbols.\nFor that reason the attacker often downloads the hashes and runs the\nattack on his or another machine, rather than staying on line on the target\ncompany’s network and risking detection.\nFor Ivan, the wait was not that long. Several hours later the program\npresented him with passwords for every one of the development team\nmembers. But these were the passwords for users on the ATM6 machine,\nand he already knew the game source code he was after was not on this\nserver.\nWhat now? He still had not been able to get a password for an account on\nthe ATM5 machine. Using his hacker mindset, understanding the poor\nsecurity habits of typical users, he figured one of the team members might\nhave chosen the same password for both machines.\nIn fact, that’s exactly what he found. One of the team members was using\nthe password \"garners\" on both ATM5 and ATM6.\nThe door had swung wide open for Ivan to hunt around until he found the\nprograms he was after. Once he located the source-code tree and gleefully\ndownloaded it, he took one further step typical of system crackers: He\nchanged the password of a dormant account that had administrator rights,\njust in case he wanted to get an updated version of the software at some\ntime in the future.\nAnalyzing the Con\nIn this attack that called on both technical and people-based\nvulnerabilities, the attacker began with a pretext telephone call to obtain\nthe location and host names of the development servers that held the\nproprietary information.\nHe then used a software utility to identify valid account-user names for\neveryone who had an account on the development server. Next he ran two\nsuccessive password attacks, including a dictionary attack, which searches\nfor commonly used passwords by trying all of the words in an English\ndictionary, sometimes augmented by several word lists containing names,\nplaces, and items of special interest.\nBecause both commercial and public-domain hacking tools can be\nobtained by anyone for whatever purpose they have in mind, it’s all the\nmore important that you be vigilant in protecting enterprise computer\nsystems and your network infrastructure.\nThe magnitude of this threat cannot be overestimated. According to\nComputer World magazine, an analysis at New York-based Oppenheimer\nFunds led to a startling discovery. The firm’s Vice President of Network\nSecurity and Disaster Recovery ran a password attack against the\nemployees of his firm using one of the standard software packages. The\nmagazine reported that within three minutes he managed to crack the\npasswords of 800 employees.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nIn the terminology of the game Monopoly, if you use a dictionary word\nfor your password--Go directly to Jail. Do not pass Go, do not collect\n$200. You have to teach your employees how to choose passwords that\ntruly protect your assets.\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nSocial engineering attacks may become even more destructive when the\nattacker adds a technology element. Preventing this kind of attack\ntypically involves taking steps on both human and technical levels.\nJust Say No\nIn the first story of the chapter, the telephone company RCMAC clerk\nshould not have removed the deny terminate status from the ten phone\nlines when no service order existed authorizing the change. It’s not\nenough for employees to know the security policies and procedures;\nemployees must understand how important these policies are to the\ncompany in preventing damage.\nSecurity policies should discourage deviation from procedure through a\nsystem of rewards and consequences. Naturally, the policies must be\nrealistic, not calling on employees to carry out steps so burdensome that\nthey are likely to be ignored. Also, a security awareness program needs to\nconvince employees that, while it’s important to complete job assignments\nin a timely manner, taking a shortcut that circumvents proper security\nprocedures can be detrimental to the company and co workers.\nThe same caution should be present when providing information to a\nstranger on the telephone. No matter how persuasively the person presents\nhimself, regardless of the person’s status or seniority in the company,\nabsolutely no information should be provided that is not designated as\npublicly available until the caller’s identity has been positively verified. If\nthis policy had been strictly observed, the social engineering scheme in\nthis story would have failed and federal detainee Gondorff would never\nhave been able to plan a new scare with his pal Johnny.\nThis one point is so important that I reiterate it throughout this book:\nVerify, verify, verify. Any request not made in person should never be\naccepted without verifying the requestor’s identity--period.\nCleaning Up\nFor any company that does not have security guards around the clock, the\nscheme wherein an attacker gains access to an office after hours presents a\nchallenge. Cleaning people will ordinarily treat with respect anyone who\nappears to be with the company and appears legitimate. After all, this is\nsomeone who could get them in trouble or fired. For that reason, cleaning\ncrews, whether internal or contracted from an outside agency, must be\ntrained on physical security matters.\nJanitorial work doesn’t exactly require a college education, or even the\nability to speak English, and the usual training, if any, involves non-\nsecurity related issues such as which kind of cleaning product to use for\ndifferent tasks. Generally these people don’t get an instruction like, \"If\nsomeone asks you to let them in after hours, you need to see their\ncompany ID card, and then call the cleaning company office, explain the\nsituation, and wait for authorization.\"\nAn organization needs to plan for a situation like the one in this chapter\nbefore it happens and train people accordingly. In my personal\nexperience, I have found that most, if not all, private sector businesses are\nvery lax in this area of physical security. You might try to approach the\nproblem from the other end, putting the burden on your company’s own\nemployees. A company without 24-hour guard service should tell its\nemployees that to get in after hours, they are to bring their own keys or\nelectronic access cards, and must never put the cleaning people in the\nposition of deciding who it is okay to admit. Then tell the janitorial\ncompany that their people must always be trained that no one is to be\nadmitted to your premises by them at any time. This is a simple rule: Do\nnot open the door for anyone. If appropriate, this could be put into writing\nas a condition of the contract with the cleaning company.\nAlso, cleaning crews should be trained about piggybacking techniques\n(unauthorized persons following an authorized person into a secure\nentrance). They should also be trained not to allow another person to\nfollow them into the building just because the person looks like they\nmight be an employee.\nFollow up every now and then--say, three or four times a year--by staging\na penetration test or vulnerability assessment. Have someone show up\nat the door when the cleaning crew is at work and try to talk her way into\nthe building. Rather than using your own employees, you can hire a firm\nthat specializes in this kind of penetration testing.\nPass It On: Protect Your Passwords\nMore and more, organizations are becoming increasingly vigilant about\nenforcing security policies through technical means--for example,\nconfiguring the operating system to enforce password policies and limit\nthe number of invalid login attempts that can be made before locking out\nthe account. In fact, Microsoft Windows business platforms generally\nhave this feature built in. Still, recognizing how easily annoyed customers\nare by features that require extra effort, the products are usually delivered\nwith security features turned off. It’s really about time that software\nmanufacturers stop delivering products with security features disabled by\ndefault when it should be the other way around. (I suspect they’ll figure\nthis out soon enough.)\nOf course, corporate security policy should mandate system\nadministrators to enforce security policy through technical means\nwhenever possible, with the goal of not relying on fallible humans any\nmore than necessary. It’s a no-brainer that when you limit the number of\nsuccessive invalid login attempts to a particular account, for example, you\nmake an attacker’s life significantly more difficult.\nEvery organization faces that uneasy balance between strong security and\nemployee productivity, which leads some employees to ignore security\npolicies, not accepting how essential these safeguards are for protecting\nthe integrity of sensitive corporate information.\nIf a company’s policies leave some issues un-addressed, employees may\nuse the path of least resistance and do whatever action is most convenient\nand makes their job easier. Some employees may resist change and openly\ndisregard good security habits. You may have encountered such an\nemployee, who follows enforced rules about password length and\ncomplexity but then writes the password on a Post-it note and defiantly\nsticks it to his monitor.\nA vital part of protecting your organization is the use of hard-to-discover\npasswords, combined with strong security settings in your technology.\nFor a detailed discussion of recommended password policies, see Chapter\n16.",
    "question": "What are the key methods a social engineer uses to bypass technological security measures and gain access to sensitive information or systems?",
    "summary": "Social engineering often combines manipulation with technology to achieve goals. In one case, a con artist used phone system vulnerabilities to communicate with a prisoner in a federal facility. Another example shows how a hacker exploited weak passwords and social engineering to access a company's network and retrieve sensitive information. Both cases highlight the importance of strong security policies and verifying identities to prevent such attacks."

    "text": "Chapter 12\nAttacks on the Entry-Level Employee\nAs many of the stories here demonstrate, the skilled social engineer often\ntargets lower-level personnel in the organizational hierarchy. It can be\neasy to manipulate these people into revealing seemingly innocuous\ninformation that the attacker uses to advance one step closer to obtaining\nmore sensitive company information.\nAn attacker targets entry-level employees because they are typically\nunaware of the value of specific company information or of the possible\nresults of certain actions. Also, they tend to be easily influenced by some\nof the more common social engineering approaches--a caller who invokes\nauthority; a person who seems friendly and likeable; a person who\nappears to know people in the company who are known to the victim; a\nrequest that the attacker claims is urgent; or the inference that the victim\nwill gain some kind of favor or recognition.\nHere are some illustrations of the attack on the lower-level employee in\naction.\n\nTHE HELPFUL SECURITY GUARD\nSwindlers hope to find a person who’s greedy because they are the ones\nmost likely to fall for a con game. Social engineers, when targeting\nsomeone such as a member of a sanitation crew or a security guard, hope\nto find someone who is good-natured, friendly, and trusting of others.\nThey are the ones most likely to be willing to help. That’s just what the\nattacker had in mind in the following story.\nElliot’s View\nDate/time: 3:26 a.m. on a Tuesday morning in February 1998.\nLocation: Marchand Microsystems facility, Nashua, New Hampshire\nElliot Staley knew he wasn’t supposed to leave his station when he wasn’t\non his scheduled rounds. But it was the middle of the night, for crying out\nloud, and he hadn’t seen a single person since he had come on duty. And it\nwas nearly time to make his rounds anyway. The poor guy on the\ntelephone sounded like he really needed help. And it makes a person feel\nfine when they can do a little good for somebody.\nBill’s Story\nBill Goodrock had a simple goal, one he had held on to, unaltered, since\nage twelve: to retire by age twenty-four, not ever touching a penny of his\ntrust fund. To show his father, the almighty and unforgiving banker, that\nhe could be a success on his own.\nOnly two years left and it’s by now perfectly clear he won’t make his\nfortune in the next twenty-four months by being a brilliant businessman\nand he won’t do it by being a sharp investor. He once wondered about\nrobbing banks with a gun but that’s just the stuff of fiction--the risk-\nbenefit\ntrade-off is so lousy. Instead he daydreams about doing a Rifkin--robbing\na bank electronically. The last time Bill was in Europe with the family, he\nopened a bank account in Monaco with 100 Francs. It still has only 100\nfrancs in it, but he has a plan that could help it reach seven digits in a\nhurry. Maybe even eight if he’s lucky.\nBill’s girlfriend Anne-marie worked in M&A for a large Boston bank.\nOne day while waiting at her offices until she got out of a late meeting, he\ngave in to curiosity and plugged his laptop into an Ethernet port in the\nconference room he was using. Yes!--he was on their internal network,\nconnected inside the bank’s network.., behind the corporate firewall. That\ngave him an idea.\nHe pooled his talent with a classmate who knew a young woman named\nJulia, a brilliant computer science Ph.D. candidate doing an internship at\nMarchand Microsystems. Julia looked like a great source for essential\ninsider information. They told her they were writing a script for a movie\nand she actually believed them. She thought it was fun making up a story\nwith them and giving them all the details about how you could actually\nbring off the caper they had described. She thought the idea was brilliant,\nactually, and kept badgering them about giving her a screen credit, too.\nThey warned her about how often screenplay ideas get stolen and made\nher swear she’d never tell anyone.\nSuitably coached by Julia, Bill did the risky part himself and never\ndoubted he could bring it off.\nI called in the afternoon and managed to find out that the night supervisor\nof the security force was a man named Isaiah Adams. At 9:30 that night I\ncalled the building and talked to the guard on the lobby security desk. My\nstory was all based on urgency and I made myself sound a little panicky.\n\"I’m having car trouble and I can’t get to the facility,\" I said. \"I have this\nemergency and I really need your help. I tried calling the guard\nsupervisor, Isaiah, but he’s not at home. Can you just do me this onetime\nfavor, I’d really appreciate it?\"\nThe rooms in that big facility were each labeled with a mail-stop code so I\ngave him the mail-stop of the computer lab and asked him if he knew\nwhere that was. He said yes, and agreed to go there for me. He said it\nwould take him a few minutes to get to the room, and I said I’d call him in\nthe lab, giving the excuse that I was using the only phone line available to\nme and I was using it to dial into the network to try to fix the problem.\nHe was already there and waiting by the time I called, and I told him\nwhere to find the console I was interested in, looking for one with a paper\nbanner reading \"elmer\"--the host that Julia had said was used to build the\nrelease versions of the operating system that the company marketed.\nWhen he said he had found it, I knew for sure that Julia had been feeding\nus good information and my heart skipped a beat. I had him hit the Enter\nkey a couple of times, and he said it printed a pound sign. Which told me\nthe computer was logged in as root, the super-user account with all system\nprivileges. He was a hunt-and-peck typist and got all in a sweat when I\ntried to talk him through entering my next command, which was more\nthan a bit tricky:\necho ’fix:x:0:0::/:/bin/sh’ >> /etc/passwd\nFinally he got it right, and we had now provided an account with a name\nfix. And then I had him type\necho ’fix: :10300:0:0’ 55 /etc/shadow\nThis established the encrypted password, which goes between the double\ncolon. Putting nothing between those two colons meant the account would\nhave a null password. So just those two commands was all it took\nto append the account fix to the password file, with a null password. Best\nof all, the account would have the same privileges as a super-user.\nThe next thing I had him do was to enter a recursive directory command\nthat printed out a long list of file names. Then I had him feed the paper\nforward, tear it off, and take it with him back to his guard desk because \"I\nmay need you to read me something from it later on.\"\nThe beauty of this was that he had no idea he had created a new account.\nAnd I had him print out the directory listing of filenames because I\nneeded to make sure the commands he typed earlier would leave the\ncomputer room with him. That way the system administrator or operator\nwouldn’t spot anything the next morning that would alert them there had\nbeen a security breach.\nI was now set up with an account, a password, and full privileges. A little\nbefore midnight I dialed in and followed the instructions Julia had\ncarefully typed up \"for the screenplay.\" In a blink I had access to one of\nthe development systems that contained the master copy of the source\ncode for the new version of the company’s operating system software.\nI uploaded a patch that Julia had written, which she said modified a\nroutine in one of the operating system’s libraries. That patch would, in\neffect, create a covert backdoor that would allow remote access into the\nsystem with a secret password.\n\nNOTE\nThe type of backdoor used here does not change the operating system\nlogin program itself Rather, a specific function contained within the\ndynamic library used by the login program is replaced to create the secret\nentry point. In typical attacks, computer intruders often replace or patch\nthe login program itself, but sharp system administrators can detect the\nchange by comparing it to the version shipped on media such as cd , or by\nother distribution methods.\nI carefully followed the instructions she had written down for me, first\ninstalling the patch, then taking steps that removed the fix account and\nwiped clean all audit logs so there would be no trace of my activities,\neffectively erasing my tracks.\nSoon the company would begin shipping the new operating system\nupgrade to their customers: Financial institutions all over the world. And\nevery copy they sent out would include the backdoor I had placed into the\nmaster distribution before it was sent out, allowing me to access any\ncomputer system of every bank and brokerage house that installed the\nupgrade.\n\nLINGO\nPATCH Traditionally a piece of code that , when placed in an executable\nprogram, fixes a problem.\nOf course, I wasn’t quite home free--there would still be work to do. I’d\nstill have to gain access to the internal network of each financial\ninstitution I wanted to \"visit.\" Then I’d have to find out which of their\ncomputers was used for money transfers, and install surveillance software\nto learn the details of their operations and exactly how to transfer funds.\nAll of that I could do long distance. From a computer located anywhere.\nSay, overlooking a sandy beach. Tahiti, here I come.\nI called the guard back, thanked him for his help, and told him he could\ngo ahead and toss the printout.\nAnalyzing the Con\nThe security guard had instructions about his duties, but even thorough,\nwell-thought-out instructions can’t anticipate every possible situation.\nNobody had told him the harm that could be done by typing a few\nkeystrokes on a computer for a person he thought was a company\nemployee.\nWith the cooperation of the guard, it was relatively easy to gain access to\na critical system that stored the distribution master, despite the fact that it\nwas behind the locked door of a secure laboratory. The guard, of course,\nhad keys to all locked doors.\nEven a basically honest employee (or, in this case, the Ph.D. candidate\nand company intern, Julia) can sometimes be bribed or deceived into\nrevealing information of crucial importance to a social engineering attack,\nsuch as where the target computer system is located and--the key to the\nsuccess of this attack---when they were going to build the new release of\nthe software for distribution. That’s important, since a change of this kind\nmade too early has a higher chance of being detected or being nullified if\nthe operating system is rebuilt from a clean source.\nDid you catch the detail of having the guard take the printout back to the\nlobby desk and later destroying it? This was an important step. When the\ncomputer operators came to work the next workday, the attacker didn’t\nwant them to find this damning evidence on the hard-copy terminal, or\nnotice it in the trash. Giving the guard a plausible excuse to take the\nprintout with him avoided that risk.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nWhen the computer intruder cannot gain physical access to a computer\nsystem or network himself, he will try to manipulate another person to do\nit for him. In cases where physical access is necessary for the plan, using\nthe victim as a proxy is even better than doing it himself, because the\nattacker assumes much less risk of detection and apprehension.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY PATCH\nYou would think a tech support guy would understand the dangers of\ngiving access to the computer network to an outsider. But when that\noutsider is a clever social engineer masquerading as a helpful software\nvendor, the results might not be what you expect.\nA Helpful Call\nThe caller wanted to know Who’s in charge of computers there? and the\ntelephone operator put him through to the tech support guy, Paul Ahearn.\nThe caller identified himself as \"Edward, with SeerWare, your database\nvendor. Apparently a bunch of our customers didn’t get the email about\nour emergency update, so we’re calling a few for a quality control check\nto see whether there was a problem installing the patch. Have you\ninstalled the update yet?\"\nPaul said he was pretty sure he hadn’t seen anything like that.\nEdward said, \"Well, it could cause intermittent catastrophic loss of data,\nso we recommend you get it installed as soon as possible.\" Yes, that was\nsomething he certainly wanted to do, Paul said. \"Okay,\" the caller\nresponded. \"We can send you a tape or CD with the patch, and I want to\ntell you, it’s really critical--two companies already lost several days of\ndata. So you really should get this installed as soon as it arrives, before it\nhappens to your company.\"\n\"Can’t I download it from your Web site?\" Paul wanted to know.\n\"It should be available soon--the tech team has been putting out all these\nfires. If you want, we can have our customer support center install it for\nyou, remotely. We can either dial up or use Telnet to connect to the\nsystem, if you can support that.\"\n\"We don’t allow Telnet, especially from the Internet--it’s not secure,\" Paul\nanswered. \"If you can use SSH, that’d be okay,\" he said, naming a product\nthat provides secure file transfers.\n\"Yeah. We have SSH. So what’s the IP address?\"\nPaul gave him the IP address, and when Andrew asked, \"and what\nusername and password can I use,\" Paul gave him those, as well.\nAnalyzing the Con\nOf course that phone call might really have come from the database\nmanufacturer. But then the story wouldn’t belong in this book.\nThe social engineer here influenced the victim by creating a sense of fear\nthat critical data might be lost, and offered an immediate solution that\nwould resolve the problem.\nAlso, when a social engineer targets someone who knows the value of the\ninformation, he needs to come up with very convincing and persuasive\narguments for giving remote access. Sometimes he needs to add the\nelement of urgency so the victim is distracted by the need to rush, and\ncomplies before he has had a chance to give much thought to the request.\n\nTHE NEW GIRL\nWhat kind of information in your company’s files might an attacker want\nto gain access to? Sometimes it can be something you didn’t think you\nneeded to protect at all.\nSarah(cid:146)s Call\n\"Human Resources, this is Sarah.\"\n\"Hi, Sarah. This is George, in the parking garage. You know the access\ncard you use to get into the parking garage and elevators? Well, we had a\nproblem and we need to reprogram the cards for all the new hires from the\nlast fifteen days.\"\n\"So you need their names?\"\n\"And their phone numbers.\"\n\"I can check our new hire list and call you back. What’s your phone\nnumber?\"\n\"I’m at 73 . . . Uh, I’m going on .break, how about if I call you back in a\nhalf-hour?\"\n\"Oh. Okay.\"\nWhen he called back, she said:\n\"Oh, yes. Well, there’s just two. Anna Myrtle, in Finance, she’s a\nsecretary. And that new VP, Mr. Underwood.\"\n\"And the phone numbers?\"\n\"Right Okay, Mr. Underwood is 6973. Anna Myrtle is 2127.\"\n\"Hey, you’ve been a big help. \"thanks.\"\nAnna(cid:146)s Call\n\"Finance, Anna speaking.\"\n\"I’m glad I found somebody working late. Listen, this is Ron Vittaro, I’m\npublisher of the business division. I don’t think we’ve been introduced.\nWelcome to the company.\"\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\"Anna, I’m in Los Angeles and I’ve got a crisis. I need to take about ten\nminutes of your time.\"\n\"Of course. What do you need?\"\n\"Go up to my office. Do you know where my office is?\n\"No.\"\n\"Okay, it’s the corner office on the fifteenth floor(cid:151)room 1502. I’ll call\nyou there in a few minutes. When you get to the office, you’ll need to\npress the forward button on the phone so my call won’t go directly to my\nvoice mail.\"\n\"Okay, I’m on my way now.\"\nTen minutes later she was in his office, had cancelled his call forwarding\nand was waiting when the phone rang. He told her to sit down at the\ncomputer and launch Internet Explorer. When it was running he told her\nto type in an address: www.geocities.com/ron-insen/manuscript.doc.exe.\nA dialog box appeared, and he told her to click Open. The computer\nappeared to start downloading the manuscript, and then the screen went\nblank. When she reported that something seemed to be wrong, he replied,\n\"Oh, no. Not again. I’ve been having a problem with downloading from\nthat Web site every so often but I thought it was fixed. Well, okay, don’t\nworry, I’ll get the file another way later.\" Then he asked her to restart his\ncomputer so he could be sure it would start up properly after the problem\nshe had just had. He talked her through the steps for rebooting.\nWhen the computer was running again properly, he thanked her warmly\nand hung up, and Anna went back to the Finance department to finish the\njob she had been working on.\nKurt Dillon’s Story\nMillard-Fenton Publishers was enthusiastic about the new author they\nwere just about to sign up, the retired CEO of a Fortune 500 company\nwho had a fascinating story to tell. Someone had steered the man to a\nbusiness manager for handling his negotiations. The business manager\ndidn’t want to admit he knew zip about publishing contracts, so he hired\nan old friend to help him figure out what he needed to know. The old\nfriend, unfortunately, was not a very good choice. Kurt Dillon used what\nwe might call unusual methods in his research, methods not entirely\nethical.\nKurt signed up for a free site on Geocities, in the name of Ron Vittaro,\nand loaded a spy-ware program onto the new site. He changed the name\nof the program to manuscript.doc.exe, so the name would appear to be a\nWord document and not raise suspicion. In fact, this worked even better\nthan Kurt had anticipated; because the real Vittaro had never changed a\ndefault setting in his Windows operating system called \"Hide file\nextensions for known file types.\" Because of that setting the file was\nactually displayed with the name manuscript.doc.\nThen he had a lady friend call Vittaro’s secretary. Following Dillon’s\ncoaching, she said, \"I’m the executive assistant to Paul Spadone, president\nof Ultimate Bookstores, in Toronto. Mr. Vittaro met my boss at a book\nfair a while back, and asked him to call to discuss a project they might do\ntogether. Mr. Spadone is on the road a lot, so he said I should find out\nwhen Mr. Vittaro will be in the office.\"\nBy the time the two had finished comparing schedules, the lady friend had\nenough information to provide the attacker with a list of dates when Mr.\nVittaro would be in the office. Which meant he also knew when Vittaro\nwould be out of the office. It hadn’t required much extra conversation to\nfind out that Vittaro’s secretary would be taking advantage of his absence\nto get in a little skiing. For a short span of time, both would be out of the\noffice. Perfect.\n\nLINGO\nSPYWARE Specialized software used to covertly monitor a targets\ncomputer activities. One form used to track the sites visited by internet\nshoppers so that on-line advertisements can be tailored to their surfing\nhabits. The other form is analogous to a wiretap, except that the target\ndevice is a computer. The software captures the activities of the user,\nincluding passwords and keystrokes typed, email, chat conversations,\ninstant messenger, all the web sites visited, and screenshots of the display\nscreen.\n\nLINGO\nSILENT INSTALL A method of installing a software application\nwithout the computer user or operator being aware that such a action is\ntaking place.\nThe first day they were supposed to be gone he placed a pretext urgent\ncall just to make sure, and was told by a receptionist that \"Mr. Vittaro is\nnot in the office and neither is his secretary. Neither of them is expected\nany time today or tomorrow or the next day.\"\nHis very first try at conning a junior employee into taking part in his\nscheme was successful, and she didn’t seem to blink an eye at being told\nto help him by downloading a \"manuscript,\" which was actually a\npopular, commercially available spyware program that the attacker had\nmodified for a silent install. Using this method, the installation would not\nbe detected by any antivirus software. For some strange reason, antivirus\nmanufacturers do not market products that will detect commercially\navailable spyware.\nImmediately after the young woman had loaded the software onto\nVittaro’s computer, Kurt went back up to the Geocities site and replaced\nthe doc.exe file with a book manuscript he found on the Internet. Just in\ncase anyone stumbled on the ruse and returned to the site to investigate\nwhat had taken place, all they’d find would be an innocuous, amateurish,\nun-publishable book manuscript.\nOnce the program had been installed and the computer rebooted, it was\nset to immediately become active. Ron Vittaro would return to town in a\nfew days, start to work, and the spyware would begin forwarding all the\nkeystrokes typed on his computer, including all outgoing emails and\nscreen shots showing what was displayed on his screen at that moment. It\nwould all be sent at regular intervals to a free email service provider in the\nUkraine.\nWithin a few days after Vittaro’s return, Kurt was plowing through the log\nfiles piling up in his Ukrainian mailbox and before long had located\nconfidential emails that indicated just how far Millard-Fenton Publishing\nwas willing to go in making a deal with the author. Armed with that\nknowledge, it was easy for the author’s agent to negotiate much better\nterms than originally offered, without ever running the risk of losing the\ndeal altogether. Which, of course, meant a bigger commission for the\nagent.\nAnalyzing the Con\nIn this ruse, the attacker made his success more likely by picking a new\nemployee to act as his proxy, counting on her being more willing to\ncooperate and be a team player, and being less likely to have knowledge\nof the company, its people, and good security practices which could\nthwart the attempt.\nBecause Kurt was pretexting as a vice president in his conversation with\nAnna, a clerk in Finance, he knew that it would be very unlikely that she\nwould question his authority. On the contrary, she might entertain the\nthought that helping a VP could gain her favor.\nAnd the process he walked Anna through that had the effect of installing\nthe spyware appeared innocuous on its face. Anna had no idea that her\nseemingly innocent actions had set an attacker up to gain valuable\ninformation that could be used against the interests of the company.\nAnd why did he choose to forward the VP’s message to an email account\nin the Ukraine? For several reasons a far-off destination makes tracing or\ntaking action against an attacker much less likely. These types of crimes\nare generally considered low priority in countries like this, where the\npolice tend to hold the view that committing a crime over the Internet isn’t\na noteworthy offense. For that reason, using email drops in countries that\nare unlikely to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement is an attractive\nstrategy.\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nA social engineer will always prefer to target an employee who is unlikely\nto recognize that there is something suspicious about his requests. It\nmakes his job not only easier, but also less risky--as the stories in this\nchapter illustrate.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nAsking a co-worker or subordinate to do a favor is a common practice.\nSocial engineers know how to exploit people’s natural desire to help and\nbe a team player. An attacker exploits this positive human trait to deceive\nunsuspecting employees into performing actions that advance him toward\nhis goal. It’s important to understand this simple concept so you will be\nmore likely to recognize when another person is trying to manipulate you.\nDeceiving the Unwary\nI’ve emphasized earlier the need to train employees thoroughly enough\nthat they will never allow themselves to be talked into carrying out the\ninstructions of a stranger. All employees also need to understand the\ndanger of carrying out a request to take any action on another person’s\ncomputer. Company policy should prohibit this except when specifically\napproved by a manager. Allowable situations include:\nWhen the request is made by a person well known to you, with the request\nmade either face-to-face, or over the telephone when you unmistakably\nrecognize the voice of the caller.\nWhen you positively verify the identity of the requestor through approved\nprocedures.\nWhen the action is authorized by a supervisor or other person in authority\nwho is personally familiar with the requestor.\nEmployees must be trained not to assist people they do not personally\nknow, even if the person making the request claims to be an executive.\nOnce security policies concerning verification have been put in place,\nmanagement must support employees in adhering to these policies, even\nwhen it means that an employee challenges a member of the executive\nstaff who is asking the employee to circumvent a security policy.\nEvery company also needs to have policies and procedures that guide\nemployees in responding to requests to take any action with computers or\ncomputer-related equipment. In the story about the publishing company,\nthe social engineer targeted a new employee who had not been trained on\ninformation security policies and procedures. To prevent this type of\nattack, every existing and new employee must be told to follow a simple\nrule: Do not use any computer system to perform an action requested by a\nstranger. Period.\nRemember that any employee who has physical or electronic access to a\ncomputer or an item of computer-related equipment is vulnerable to being\nmanipulated into taking some malicious action on behalf of an attacker.\nEmployees, and especially IT personnel, need to understand that allowing\nan outsider to gain access to their computer networks is like giving your\nbank account number to a telemarketer or giving your telephone calling\ncard number to a stranger in jail. Employees must give thoughtful\nattention to whether carrying out a request can lead to disclosure of\nsensitive information or the compromising of the corporate computer\nsystem.\nIT people must also be on their guard against unknown callers posing as\nvendors. In general, a company should consider having specific people\ndesignated as the contacts for each technology vendor, with a policy in\nplace that other employees will not respond to vendor requests for\ninformation about or changes to any telephone or computer equipment.\nThat way, the designated people become familiar with the vendor\npersonnel who call or visit, and are less likely to be deceived by an\nimposter. If a vendor calls even when the company does not have a\nsupport contract, that should also raise suspicions.\nEveryone in the organization needs to be made aware of information\nsecurity threats and vulnerabilities. Note that security guards and the like\nneed to be given not just security training, but training in information\nsecurity, as well. Because security guards frequently have physical access\nto the entire facility, they must be able to recognize the types of social\nengineering attacks that may be used against them.\nBeware Spyware\nCommercial spyware was once used mostly by parents to monitor what\ntheir children were doing on the Internet, and by employers, supposedly to\ndetermine which employees were goofing off by surfing the Internet. A\nmore serious use was to detect potential theft of information assets or\nindustrial espionage. Developers market their spyware by offering it as a\ntool to protect the children, when in fact their true market is people who\nwant to spy on someone. Nowadays, the sale of spyware is driven to a\ngreat extent by people’s desire to know if their spouse or significant other\nis cheating on them.\nShortly before I began writing the spyware story in this book, the person\nwho receives email for me (because I’m not allowed to use the Internet)\nfound a spam email message advertising a group of spyware products.\nOne of the items offered was described like this:\nFAVORITE! MUST HAVE:\nThis powerful monitoring and spy program secretly captures all\nkeystrokes and the time and title of all active windows to a text file, while\nrunning hidden in the background. Logs can be encrypted and\nautomatically sent to a specified email address, or just recorded on the\nhard drive. Access to the program is password protected and it can be\nhidden from the CTRL+ALT+DEL menu.\nUse it to monitor typed URLs, chat sessions, emails and many other\nthings (even passwords).\nInstall without detection on ANY PC and email yourself the logs!\nAntivirus Gap?\nAntivirus software doesn’t detect commercial spyware, thereby treating\nthe software as not malicious even though the intent is to spy on other\npeople. So the computer equivalent of wiretapping goes unnoticed,\ncreating the risk that each of us might be under illegal surveillance at any\ntime. Of course, the antivirus software manufacturers may argue that\nspyware can be used for legitimate purposes, and therefore should not be\ntreated as malicious. But the developers of certain tools once used by the\nhacking community, which are now being freely distributed or sold as\nsecurity-related software, are nonetheless treated as malicious code.\nThere’s a double standard here, and I’m left wondering why.\nAnother item offered in the same email promised to capture screen shots\nof the user’s computer, just like having a video camera looking over his\nshoulder. Some of these software products do not even require physical\naccess to the victim’s computer. Just install and configure the application\nremotely, and you have an instant computer wiretap! The FBI must love\ntechnology.\nWith spyware so readily available, your enterprise needs to establish two\nlevels of protection. You should install spyware-detection software such\nas SpyCop (available from www.spycop.com) on all workstations, and\nyou should require that employees initiate periodic scans. In addition, you\nmust train employees against the danger of being deceived into\ndownloading a program, or opening an email attachment that could install\nmalicious software.\nIn addition to preventing spyware from being installed while an employee\nis away from his desk for a coffee break, lunch, or a meeting, a policy\nmandating that all employees lock their computer systems with a screen\nsaver password or similar method will substantially mitigate the risk of an\nunauthorized person being able to access a worker’s computer. No one\nslipping into the person’s cubicle or office will be able to access any of\ntheir files, read their email, or install spyware or other malicious software.\nThe resources necessary to enable the screensaver password are nil, and\nthe benefit of protecting employee workstations is substantial. The cost-\nbenefit analysis in this circumstance should be a no-brainer.",
    "question": "What are some common tactics used by social engineers to manipulate entry-level employees into revealing sensitive company information or assisting in a cyberattack?",
    "summary": "Social engineers often target entry-level employees because they are more likely to be gullible and less aware of security risks. In the case of Elliot's View, a security guard was manipulated into granting access to a computer system, allowing the attacker to create a backdoor. Another example, The Emergency Patch, shows how a social engineer can trick an employee into installing spyware by posing as a trusted vendor. Both cases highlight the importance of verifying identities and being cautious with requests involving computer access."

    "text": "Chapter 13\nClever Cons\nBy now you’ve figured out that when a stranger calls with a request for\nsensitive information or something that could be of value to an attacker,\nthe person receiving the call must be trained to get the caller’s phone\nnumber, and call back to verify that the person is really who he claims to\nbe--a company employee, or an employee of a business partner, or a\ntechnical support representative from one of your vendors, for example.\nEven when a company has an established procedure that the employees\nfollow carefully for verifying callers, sophisticated attackers are still able\nto use a number of tricks to deceive their victims into believing they are\nwho they claim to be. Even security conscious employees can be duped\nby methods such as the following.\n\nTHE MISLEADING CALLER ID\nAnyone who has ever received a call on a cell phone has observed the\nfeature known as caller ID--that familiar display showing the telephone\nnumber of the caller. In a business setting, it offers the advantage of\nallowing a worker to tell at a glance whether the call coming in is from a\nfellow employee or from outside the company.\nMany years ago some ambitious phone phreakers introduced themselves\nto the wonders of caller ID before the phone company was even allowed\nto offer the service to the public. They had a great time freaking people\nout by answering the phone and greeting the caller by name before they\nsaid a word.\nJust when you thought it was safe, the practice of verifying identity by\ntrusting what you see--what appears on the caller ID display--is exactly\nwhat the attacker may be counting on.\nLinda’s Phone Call\nDay/Time: Tuesday, July 23, 3:12 P.M.\nPlace.\" The offices of the Finance Department, Starbeat Aviation\nLinda Hill’s phone rang just as she was in the middle of writing a memo to\nher boss. She glanced at her caller ID, which showed that the call was\nfrom the corporate office in New York, but from someone named Victor\nMartin--not a name she recognized.\nShe thought of letting the call roll over to voice mail so she wouldn’t\nbreak the flow of thought on the memo. But curiosity got the better of her.\nShe picked up the phone and the caller introduced himself and said he was\nfrom PR, and working on some material for the CEO. \"He’s on his way to\nBoston for meetings with some of our bankers. He needs the top-line\nfinancials for the current quarter,\" he said. \"And one more thing. He also\nneeds the financial projections on the Apache project,\" Victor added,\nusing the code name for a product that was to be one of the company’s\nmajor releases in the spring.\nShe asked for his email address, but he said he was having a problem\nreceiving email that tech support was working on, so could she fax it\ninstead? She said that would be fine, and he gave her the internal phone\nextension to his fax machine.\nShe sent the fax a few minutes later.\nBut Victor did not work for the PR department. In fact, he didn’t even\nwork for the company.\nJack’s Story\nJack Dawkins had started his professional career at an early age as a\npickpocket working games at Yankee Stadium, on crowded subway\nplatforms, and among the night-time throng of Times Square tourists. He\nproved so nimble and artful that he could take a watch off a man’s wrist\nwithout his knowing. But in his awkward teenage years he had grown\nclumsy and been caught. In Juvenile Hall, Jack learned a new trade with a\nmuch lower risk of getting nabbed.\nHis current assignment called for him to get a company’s quarterly profit\nand loss statement and cash flow information, before the data was\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and made\npublic. His client was a dentist who didn’t want to explain why he wanted\nthe information. To Jack the man’s caution was laughable. He’d seen it all\nbefore--the guy probably had a gambling problem, or else an expensive\ngirlfriend his wife hadn’t found out about yet. Or maybe he had just been\nbragging to his wife about how smart he was in the stock market; now he\nhad lost a bundle and wanted to make a big investment on a sure thing by\nknowing which way the company’s stock price was going to go when they\nannounced their quarterly results.\nPeople are surprised to find out how little time it takes a thoughtful social\nengineer to figure out a way of handling a situation he’s never faced\nbefore. By the time Jack got home from his meeting with the dentist, he\nhad already formed a plan. His friend Charles Bates worked for a\ncompany, Panda Importing, that had its own telephone switch, or PBX.\nIn terms familiar to people knowledgeable about phone systems, the PBX\nwas connected to a digital telephone service known as a T1, configured\nas Primary Rate Interface ISDN (integrated services digital network) or\nPRI ISDN. What this meant was that every time a call was placed from\nPanda, setup and other call processing information went out over a data\nchannel to the phone company’s switch; the information included the\ncalling party number, which (unless blocked) is delivered to the caller ID\ndevice at the receiving end.\nJack’s friend knew how to program the switch so the person receiving\nthe call would see on his caller ID, not the actual phone number at the\nPanda office, but whatever phone number he had programmed into the\nswitch. This trick works because local phone companies do not bother to\nvalidate the calling number received from the customer against the actual\nphone numbers the customer is paying for.\nAll Jack Dawkins needed was access to any such telephone service.\nHappily his friend and sometime partner in crime, Charles Bates, was\nalways glad to lend a helping hand for a nominal fee. On this occasion,\nJack and Charles temporarily reprogrammed the company’s telephone\nswitch so that calls from a particular telephone line located on the Panda\npremises would spoof Victor Martin’s internal telephone number, making\nthe call appear to be coming from within Starbeat Aviation.\nThe idea that your caller ID can be made to show any number you wish is\nso little known that it’s seldom questioned. In this case, Linda was happy\nto fax the requested information to the guy she thought was from PR.\nWhen Jack hung up, Charles reprogrammed his company’s telephone\nswitch, restoring the telephone number to the original settings.\nAnalyzing the Con\nSome companies don’t want customers or vendors to know the telephone\nnumbers of their employees. For example, Ford may decide that calls\nfrom their Customer Support Center should show the 800-number for the\nCenter and a name like \"Ford Support,\" instead of the real direct-dial\nphone number of each support representative placing a call. Microsoft\nmay want to give their employees the option of telling people their phone\nnumber, instead of having everyone they call be able to glance at their\ncaller ID and know their extension. In this way the company is able to\nmaintain the confidentiality of internal numbers.\nBut this same capability of reprogramming provides a handy tactic for the\nprankster, bill collector, telemarketer, and, of course, the social engineer.\n\nVARIATION: THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS\n\nCALLING\nAs co-host of a radio show in Los Angeles called \"Darkside of the\nInternet\" on KFI Talk Radio, I worked under the station’s program\ndirector. David, one of the most committed and hardworking people I’ve\never met, is very difficult to reach by telephone because he’s so busy. He’s\none of those people who doesn’t answer a call unless he sees from the\ncaller ID that it’s someone he needs to talk to.\nWhen I’d phone him, because I have call blocking on my cell phone, he\ncould not tell who was calling and wouldn’t pick up the call. It would roll\nover to voice mail, and it became very frustrating for me.\nI talked over what to do about this with a long-time friend who is the\ncofounder of a real estate firm that provides office space for high-tech\ncompanies. Together we came up with a plan. He had access to his\ncompany’s Meridian telephone switch, which gives him the ability to\nprogram the calling party number, as described in the previous story.\nWhenever I needed to reach the program director and couldn’t get a call\nthrough, I would ask my friend to program any number of my choosing to\nappear on the caller ID. Sometimes I’d have him make the call look as if it\nwas coming from David’s office assistant, or sometimes from the holding\ncompany that owns the station.\nBut my favorite was programming the call to appear from David’s own\nhome telephone number, which he always picked up. H1 give the guy\ncredit, though. He always had a good sense of humor about it when he’d\npick up the phone and discover I had fooled him once again. The best part\nwas that he’d then stay on the line long enough to find out what I wanted\nand resolve whatever the issue was.\nWhen I demonstrated this little trick on the Art Bell Show, I spoofed my\ncaller ID to display the name and number of the Los Angeles headquarters\nof the FBI. Art was quite shocked about the whole affair and admonished\nme for doing something illegal. But I pointed out to him that it’s perfectly\nlegal, as long as it’s not an attempt to commit fraud. After the program I\nreceived several hundred emails asking me to explain how I had done it.\nNow you know.\nThis is the perfect tool to build credibility for the social engineer. If, for\nexample, during the research stage of the social engineering attack cycle,\nit was discovered that the target had caller ID, the attacker could spoof his\nor her own number as being from a trusted company or employee. A bill\ncollector can make his or her calls appear to come from your place of\nbusiness.\nBut stop and think about the implications. A computer intruder can call\nyou at home claiming to be from the IT department at your company. The\nperson on the line urgently needs your password to restore your files from\na server crash. Or the caller ID displays the name and number of your\nbank or stock brokerage house, the pretty sounding girl just needs to\nverify your account numbers and your mother’s maiden name. For good\nmeasure, she also needs to verify your ATM PIN because of some system\nproblem. A stock market boiler-room operation can make their calls seem\nto come from Merrill Lynch or Citibank. Someone out to steal your\nidentity could call, apparently from Visa, and convince you to tell him\nyour Visa card number. A guy with a grudge could call and claim to be\nfrom the IRS or the FBI.\nIf you have access to a telephone system connected to a PRI, plus a bit of\nprogramming knowledge that you can probably acquire from the system\nvendor’s Web site, you can use this tactic for playing cool tricks on your\nfriends. Know anybody with overblown political aspirations? You could\nprogram the referral number as 202 456-1414, and his caller ID will\ndisplay the name \"WHITE HOUSE.\"\nHe’ll think he’s getting a call from the president!\nThe moral of the story is simple: Caller ID cannot be trusted, except when\nbeing used to identify internal calls. Both at work and at home, everyone\nneeds to become aware of the caller ID trick and recognize that the name\nor phone number shown in a caller ID display cannot ever be trusted for\nverification of identity.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nThe next time you receive a call and your caller ID shows it’s from your\ndear old mom, you never know--it might be from a sweet little old social\nengineer.\n\nTHE INVISIBLE EMPLOYEE\nShirley Cutlass has found a new and exciting way to make fast money. No\nmore putting in long hours at the salt mine. She has joined the hundreds of\nother scam artists involved in the crime of the decade. She is an identity\nthief.\nToday she has set her sights on getting confidential information from the\ncustomer service department of a credit card company. After doing the\nusual kind of homework, she calls the target company and tells the\nswitchboard operator who answers that she’d like to be connected to the\nTelecom Department. Reaching Telecom, she asks for the voice mail\nadministrator.\nUsing information gathered from her research, she explains that her name\nis Norma Todd from the Cleveland office. Using a ruse that should by\nnow be familiar to you, she says she’ll be traveling to corporate\nheadquarters for a week, and she’ll need a voice mailbox there so she\nwon’t have to make long distance calls to check her voice mail messages.\nNo need for a physical telephone connection, she says, just a voice\nmailbox. He says he’ll take care of it, he’ll call her back when it’s set up to\ngive her the information she’ll need.\nIn a seductive voice, she says \"I’m on my way into a meeting, can I call\nyou back in an hour.\nWhen she calls back, he says it’s all set up, and gives her the information--\nher extension number and temporary password. He asks whether she\nknows how to change the voice mail password, and she lets him talk her\nthrough the steps, though she knows them at least as well as he does.\n\"And by the way,\" she asks, \"from my hotel, what number do I call to\ncheck my messages?\" He gives her the number.\nShirley phones in, changes the password, and records her new outgoing\ngreeting.\nShirley Attacks\nSo far it’s all been an easy setup. She’s now ready to use the art of\ndeception.\nShe calls the customer service department of the company. \"I’m with\nCollections, in the Cleveland office,\" she says, and then launches into a\nvariation on the by-now familiar excuse. \"My computer is being fixed by\ntechnical support and I need your help looking up this information.\" And\nshe goes on to provide the name and date of birth of the person whose\nidentity she is intent on stealing. Then she lists the information she wants:\naddress, mother’s maiden name, card number, credit limit, available\ncredit, and payment history. \"Call me back at this number,\" she says,\ngiving the internal extension number that the voice mail administrator set\nup for her. \"And if I’m not available, just leave the information on my\nvoice mail.\"\nShe keeps busy with errands for the rest of the morning, and then checks\nher voice mail that afternoon. It’s all there, everything she asked for.\nBefore hanging up, Shirley clears the outgoing message; it would be\ncareless to leave a recording of her voice behind.\nAnd identify theft, the fastest growing crime in America, the \"in\" crime of\nthe new century, is about to have another victim. Shirley uses the credit-\ncard and identity information she just obtained, and begins running up\ncharges on the victim’s card.\nAnalyzing the Con\nIn this ruse, the attacker first duped the company(cid:146)s voice mail\nadministrator into believing she was an employee, so that he would set up\na temporary voice mailbox. If he bothered to check at all, he would have\nfound that the name and telephone number she gave matched the listings\nin the corporate employee database.\nThe rest was simply a matter of giving a reasonable excuse about a\ncomputer\nproblem, asking for the desired information, and requesting that the\nresponse be left on voice mail. And why would any employee be reluctant\nto share information with a co-worker? Since the phone number that\nShirley provided was clearly an internal extension, there was no reason\nfor any suspicion.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nTry calling your own voice mail once in a while; if you hear an outgoing\nmessage that’s not yours, you may have just encountered your first social\nengineer.\n\nTHE HELPFUL SECRETARY\nCracker Robert Jorday had been regularly breaking into the computer net\nworks of a global company, Rudolfo Shipping, Inc. The company\neventually recognized that someone was hacking into their terminal\nserver, an, that through that server the user could connect to any computer\nsystem at the company. To safeguard the corporate network, the company\ndecide, to require a dial-up password on every terminal server.\nRobert called the Network Operations Center posing as an attorney with\nthe Legal Department and said he was having trouble connecting to the\nnetwork. The network administrator he reached explained that there had\nbeen some recent security issues, so all dial-up access users would need to\nobtain the monthly password from their manager. Robert wondered what\nmethod was being used to communicate each month’s password to the\nmanagers and how he could obtain it. The answer, it turned out, was that\nthe password for the upcoming month was sent in a memo via office, mail\nto each company manager.\nThat made things easy. Robert did a little research, called the company\njust after the first of the month, and reached the secretary of one manager\nwho gave her name as Janet. He said, \"Janet, hi. This is Randy Goldstein\nin Research and Development. I know I probably got the memo with this\nmonth’s password for logging into the terminal server from outside the\ncompany but I can’t find it anywhere. Did you get your memo for this,\nmonth?\"\nYes, she said, she did get it.\nHe asked her if she would fax it to him, and she agreed. He gave her the\nfax number of the lobby receptionist in a different building on the\ncompany campus, where he had already made arrangements for faxes to\nbe held for him, and would then arrange for the password fax to be\nforwarded. This time, though, Robert used a different fax-forwarding\nmethod. He gave the receptionist a fax number that went to an on-line fax\nservice. When this service receives a fax, the automated system sends it to\nthe subscriber’s email address.\nThe new password arrived at the email dead drop that Robert set up on a\nfree email service in China. He was sure that if the fax was ever traced,\nthe investigator would be pulling out his hair trying to gain cooperation\nfrom Chinese officials, who, he knew, were more than a little reluctant to\nbe helpful in matters like this. Best of all, he never had to show up\nphysically at the location of the fax machine.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nThe skilled social engineer is very clever at influencing other people to do\nfavors for him. Receiving a fax and forwarding it to another location\nappears so harmless that it’s all too easy to persuade a receptionist or\nsomeone else to agree to do it. When somebody asks for a favor involving\ninformation, if you don’t know him or can’t verify his identity, just say no.\n\nTRAFFIC COURT\nProbably everyone who has ever been given a speeding ticket has\ndaydreamed about some way of beating it. Not by going to traffic school,\nor simply paying the fine, or taking a chance on trying to convince the\njudge about some technicality like how long it has been since the police-\ncar speedometer or the radar gun was checked. No, the sweetest scenario\nwould be beating the ticket by outsmarting the system.\nThe Con\nAlthough I would not recommend trying this method of beating a traffic\nticket (as the saying goes, don’t try this at home) still, this is a good\nexample of how the art of deception can be used to help the social\nengineer.\nLet’s call this traffic violater Paul Durea.\nFirst Steps\n\"LAPD, Hollenbeck Division.\"\n\"Hi, I’d like to talk to the Subpoena Control.\"\n\"I’m the subpoena clerk.\"\n\"Fine. This is Attorney John Leland, of Meecham, Meecham, and Talbott.\nI need to subpoena an officer on a case.\"\n\"Okay, which officer?\"\n\"Do you have Officer Kendall in your division?\"\n\"What’s his serial number?\"\n\"21349.\"\n\"Yes. When do you need him?\"\n\"Some time next month, but I need to subpoena several other witnesses on\nthe case and then tell the court what days will work for us. Are there any\ndays next month Officer Kendall won’t be available?\"\n\"Let’s see... He has vacation days on the 20th through the 23rd, and he has\ntraining days on the 8th and 16th.\"\n\"Thanks. That’s all I need right now. I’ll call you back when the court date\nis set.\"\nMunicipal Court, Clerk(cid:146)s Counter\nPaul: \"I’d like to schedule a court date on this traffic ticket.\"\nClerk: \"Okay. I can give you the 26th of next month.\"\n\"Well, I’d like to schedule an arraignment.\"\n\"You want an arraignment on a traffic ticket?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Okay. We can set the arraignment tomorrow in the morning or afternoon.\nWhat would you like?\"\n\"Afternoon.\"\n\"Arraignment is tomorrow at 1:30 P.M. in Courtroom Six.\" \"Thanks. I’ll\nbe there.\"\nMunicipal Court, Courtroom Six\nDate: Thursday, 1:45 P.M.\nClerk: \"Mr. Durea, please approach the bench.\"\nJudge: \"Mr. Durea, do you understand the rights that have been explained\nto you this afternoon?\"\nPaul: \"Yes, your honor.\"\nJudge: \"Do you want to take the opportunity to attend traffic school?\nYour case will be dismissed after successful completion of an eight-hour\ncourse. I’ve checked your record and you are presently eligible.\"\nPaul: \"No, your honor. I respectfully request that the case be set for trial.\nOne more thing, your honor, I’ll be travelling out of the country, but I’m\navailable on the 8th or 9th. Would it be possible to set my case for trial on\neither of those days? I’m leaving on a business trip for Europe tomorrow,\nand I return in four weeks.\"\nJudge: \"Very well. Trial is set for June 8th, 8:30 A.M., Courtroom Four.\"\nPaul: \"Thank you, your honor.\"\nMunicipal Court, Courtroom Four\nPaul arrived at court early on the 8th. When the judge came in, the clerk\ngave him a list of the cases for which the officers had not appeared. The\njudge called the defendants, including Paul, and told them their cases\nwere dismissed.\nAnalyzing the Con\nWhen an officer writes a ticket, he signs it with his name and his badge\nnumber (or whatever his personal number is called in his agency). Finding\nhis station is a piece of cake. A call to directory assistance with the name\nof the law enforcement agency shown on the citation (highway patrol,\ncounty sheriff, or whatever) is enough to get a foot in the door. Once the\nagency is contacted, they can refer the caller to the correct telephone\nnumber for the subpoena clerk serving the geographical area where the\ntraffic stop was made.\nLaw enforcement officers are subpoenaed for court appearances with\nregularity; it comes with the territory. When a district attorney or a\ndefense lawyer needs an officer to testify, if he knows how the system\nworks, he first checks to make sure the officer will be available. That’s\neasy to do; it just takes a call to the subpoena clerk for that agency.\nUsually in those conversations, the attorney asks if the officer in question\nwill be available on such-and-such a date. For this ruse, Paul needed a bit\nof tact; he had to offer a plausible reason why the clerk should tell him\nwhat dates the officer would not be available.\nWhen he first went to the court building, why didn’t Paul simply tell the\ncourt clerk what date he wanted? Easy--from what I understand, traffic-\ncourt clerks in most places don’t allow members of the public to select\ncourt dates. If a date the clerk suggests doesn’t work for the person, she’ll\noffer an alternative or two, but that’s as far as she will bend. On the other\nhand, anyone who is willing to take the extra time of showing up for an\narraignment is likely to have better luck.\nPaul knew he was entitled to ask for an arraignment. And he knew the\njudges are often willing to accommodate a request for a specific date. He\ncarefully asked for dates that coincided with the officer’s training days,\nknowing that in his state, officer training takes precedence over an\nappearance in traffic court.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nThe human mind is a marvelous creation. It’s interesting to note how\nimaginative people can be at developing deceptive ways to get what they\nwant or to get out of a sticky situation. You have to use the same\ncreativity and imagination to safeguard information and computer systems\nin the public and private sectors. So, folks, when devising your company’s\nsecurity policies--be creative and think outside the box.\nAnd in traffic court, when the officer does not show up--case dismissed.\nNo fines. No traffic school. No points. And, best of all, no record of a\ntraffic offense!\nMy guess is that some police officials, court officers, district attorneys\nand the like will read this story and shake their heads because they know\nthat this ruse does work. But shaking their heads is all they’ll do. Nothing\nwill change. I’d be willing to bet on it. As the character Cosmo says in the\n1992 movie Sneakers, \"It’s all about the ones and zeros\"--meaning that in\nthe end, everything comes down to information.\nAs long as law enforcement agencies are willing to give information\nabout an officer’s schedule to virtually anyone who calls, the ability to get\nout of traffic tickets will always exist. Do you have similar gaps in your\ncompany or organization’s procedures that a clever social engineer can\ntake advantage of to get information you’d rather they didn’t have?\nSAMANTHA’S REVENGE\nSamantha Gregson was angry.\nShe had worked hard for her college degree in business, and stacked up a\npile of student loans to do it. It had always been drummed into her that a\ncollege degree was how you got a career instead of a job, how you earned\nthe big bucks. And then she graduated and couldn’t find a decent job\nanywhere.\nHow glad she had been to get the offer from Lambeck Manufacturing.\nSure, it was humiliating to accept a secretarial position, but Mr. Cartright\nhad said how eager they were to have her, and taking the secretarial job\nwould put her on the spot when the next non-administrative position\nopened up.\nTwo months later she heard that one of Cartright’s junior product\nmanagers was leaving. She could hardly sleep that night, imagining\nherself on the fifth floor, in an office with a door, attending meetings and\nmaking decisions.\nThe next morning she went first thing to see Mr. Cartright. He said they\nfelt she needed to learn more about the industry before she was ready for a\nprofessional position. And then they went and hired an amateur from\noutside the company who knew less about the industry than she did.\nIt was about then that it began to dawn on her: The company had plenty of\nwomen, but they were almost all secretaries. They weren’t going to give\nher a management job. Ever.\nPayback\nIt took her almost a week to figure out how she was going to pay them\nback. About a month earlier a guy from an industry trade magazine had\ntried to hit on her when he came in for the new product launch. A few\nweeks later he called her up at work and said if she would send him some\nadvance information on the Cobra 273 product, he’d send her flowers, and\nif it was really hot information that he used in the magazine, he’d make a\nspecial trip in from Chicago just to take her out to dinner.\nShe had been in young Mr. Johannson’s office one day shortly after that\nwhen he logged onto the corporate network. Without thinking, she had\nwatched his fingers (shoulder surfing, this is sometimes called). He had\nentered \"marty63\" as his password.\nHer plan was beginning to come together. There was a memo she\nremembered typing not long after she came to the company. She found a\ncopy in the files and typed up a new version, using language from the\noriginal one. Her version read:\nTO: C. Pelton, IT dept.\nFROM: L. Cartright, Development\nMartin Johansson will be working with a special projects team in my\ndepartment.\nI hereby authorize him to have access to the servers used by the\nengineering group. Mr. Johansson’s security profile is to be updated to\ngrant him the same access rights as a product developer.\nLouis Cartright\n\nLINGO\nSHOULDER SURFING The act of watching a person type at his\ncomputer keyboard to detect and steal his password or other user\ninformation.\nWhen most everybody was gone at lunch, she cut Mr. Cartright’s\nsignature from the original memo, pasted it onto her new version, and\ndaubed Wite-Out around the edges. She made a copy of the result, and\nthen made a copy of the copy. You could barely see the edges around the\nsignature. She sent the fax from the machine \"near Mr. Cartright’s office.\nThree days later, she stayed after hours and waited till everyone left. She\nwalked into Johannson’s office, and tried logging onto the network with\nhis username and the password, marry63. It worked.\nIn minutes she had located the product specification files for the Cobra\n273, and downloaded them to a Zip disk.\nThe disk was safely in her purse as she walked in the cool night-time\nbreeze to the parking lot. It would be on its way to the reporter that night.\nAnalyzing the Con\nA disgruntled employee, a search through the files, a quick cut-paste-and\nWite-Out operation, a little creative copying, and a fax. And, voila!--she\nhas access to confidential marketing and product specifications.\nAnd a few days later, a trade magazine journalist has a big scoop with the\nspecs and marketing plans of a hot new product that will be in the hands\nof magazine subscribers throughout the industry months in\nadvance of the product’s release. Competitor companies will have several\nmonths head start on developing equivalent products and having their ad\ncampaigns ready to undermine the Cobra 273.\nNaturally the magazine will never say where they got the scoop.\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nWhen asked for any valuable, sensitive, or critical information that could\nbe of benefit to a competitor or anyone else, employees must be aware\nthat using caller ID as a means of verifying the identity of an outside\ncaller is not acceptable. Some other means of verification must be used,\nsuch as checking with the person’s supervisor that the request was\nappropriate and that the user has authorization to receive the information.\nThe verification process requires a balancing act that each Company must\ndefine for itself: Security versus productivity. What priority is going to be\nassigned to enforcing security measures? Will employees be resistant to\nfollowing security procedures, and even circumvent them in order to\ncomplete their job responsibilities? Do employees understand why\nsecurity is important to the company and themselves? These questions\nneed to\nbe answered to develop a security policy based on corporate culture and\nbusiness needs.\nMost people inevitably see anything that interferes with getting their work\ndone as an annoyance, and may circumvent any security measures that\nappear to be a waste of time. Motivating employees to make security part\nof their everyday responsibilities through education and awareness is key.\nAlthough caller ID service should never be used as a means of\nauthentication for voice calls from outside the company, another method\ncalled automatic number identification (ANI) can. This service is\nprovided when a company subscribes to toll-flee services where the\ncompany pays for the incoming calls and is reliable for identification.\nUnlike caller ID, the telephone company switch does not use any\ninformation that is sent from a customer when providing the calling\nnumber. The number transmitted by ANI is the billing number assigned to\nthe calling party.\nNote that several modem manufacturers have added a caller ID feature\ninto their products, protecting the corporate network by allowing remote-\naccess calls only from a list ofpreauthorized telephone numbers. Caller ID\nmodems are an acceptable means of authentication in a low-security\nenvironment but, as should be clear by now, spoofing caller ID is a\nrelatively easy technique for computer intruders, and so should not be\nrelied on for proving the caller’s identity or location in a high-security\nsetting.\nTo address the case of identity theft, as in the story about deceiving an\nadministrator to create a voice mailbox on the corporate phone system,\nmake it a policy that all phone service, all voice mailboxes, and all entries\nto the corporate directory, both in print and on line, must be requested in\nwriting, on a form provided for the purpose. The employee’s manager\nshould sign the request, and the voice mail administrator should verify the\nsignature.\nCorporate security policy should require that new computer accounts or\nincreases in access rights be granted only after positive verification of the\nperson making the request, such as a callback to the system manager or\nadministrator, or his or her designee, at the phone number listed in the\nprint or on-line company directory. If the company uses secure email\nwhere employees can digitally sign messages, this alternative verification\nmethod may also be acceptable.\nRemember that every employee, regardless of whether he has access to\ncompany computer systems, may be duped by a social engineer. Everyone\nmust be included in security awareness training. Administrative assistants,\nreceptionists, telephone operators, and security guards must be made\nfamiliar with the types of social engineering attack most likely to be\ndirected against them so that they will be better prepared to defend against\nthose attacks.",
    "question": "What are some examples of how social engineers can use deception to gain access to sensitive information or systems?",
    "summary": "The text discusses how social engineers can deceive people by manipulating caller ID information to appear as if they are from trusted sources. It provides examples of how this can be done, such as spoofing numbers to mimic internal employees or using voice mail to gain access to confidential data. The key takeaway is that caller ID should not be relied upon for verification, and companies must implement proper procedures to prevent such attacks."

    "text": "Chapter 14\nIndustrial Espionage\nThe threat of information attacks against government, corporations, and\nuniversity systems is well established. Almost every day, the media\nreports a new computer virus, denial of service attack, or theft of credit\ncard information from an e-commerce Web site.\nWe read about cases of industrial espionage such as Borland accusing\nSymantec of stealing trade secrets, Cadence Design Systems filing a suit\ncharging the theft of source code by a competitor. Many business people\nread these stories and think it could never happen at their company.\nIt’s happening every day.\n\nVARIATION ON A SCHEME\nThe ruse described in the following tale has probably been pulled off\nmany times, even though it sounds like something taken out of a\nHollywood movie like The Insider, or from the pages of a John Grisham\nnovel.\nClass Action\nImagine that a massive class-action lawsuit is raging against a major\npharmaceutical company, Pharmomedic. The suit claims that they knew\none of their very popular drugs had a devastating side effect, but one that\nwould not be evident until a patient had been on the medication for years.\nThe suit alleges that they had results from a number of research studies\nthat revealed this danger, but suppressed the evidence and never turned it\nover to the FDA as required.\nWilliam (\"Billy\") Chaney, the attorney of record on the masthead of the\nNew York law firm that filed the class-action suit, has depositions from\ntwo Pharmomedic doctors supporting the claim. But both are retired,\nneither has any files or documentation, and neither would make a strong,\nconvincing witness. Billy knows he’s on shaky ground. Unless he can get\na copy of one of those reports, or some internal memo or communication\nbetween company executives, his whole case will fall apart.\nSo he hires a firm he’s used before: Andreeson and Sons, private\ninvestigators. Billy doesn’t know how Pete and his people get the stuff\nthey do, and he doesn’t want to know. All he knows is that Pete\nAndreeson is one good investigator.\nTo Andreeson, an assignment like this is what he calls a black bag job.\nThe first rule is that the law firms and companies that hire him never learn\nhow he gets his information so that they always have complete, plausible\ndeniability. If anybody is going to have his feet shoved into boiling water,\nit’s going to be Pete, and for what he collects in fees on the big jobs, he\nfigures it’s worth the risk. Besides, he gets such personal satisfaction from\noutsmarting smart people.\nIf the documents that Chaney wants him to find actually existed and\nhaven’t been destroyed, they’ll be somewhere in the files of Pharmomedic.\nBut finding them in the massive files of a large corporation would be a\nhuge task. On the other hand, suppose they’ve turned copies over to their\nlaw firm, Jenkins and Petry? If the defense attorneys knew those\ndocuments existed and didn’t turn them over as part of the discovery\nprocess, then they have violated the legal profession’s canon of ethics, and\nviolated the law, as well. In Pete’s book, that makes any attack fair game.\nPete’s Attack\nPete gets a couple of his people started on research and within days he\nknows what company Jenkins and Petty uses for storing their offsite\nbackups. And he knows that the storage company maintains a list of the\nnames of people whom the law firm has authorized to pick up tapes from\nstorage. He also knows that each of these people has his or her own\npassword. Pete sends two of his people out on a black bag job.\nThe men tackle the lock using a lock pick gun ordered on the Web at\nwww.southord.com. Within several minutes they slip into the offices of\nthe storage firm around 3 a.m. one night and boot up a PC. They smile\nwhen they see the Windows 98 logo because it means this will be a piece\nof cake. Windows 98 does not require any form of authentication. After a\nbit of searching, they locate a Microsoft Access database with the names\nof people authorized by each of the storage company customers to pick up\ntapes. They add a phony name to the authorization list for Jenkins and\nPetry, a name matching one on a phony driver’s license one of the men\nhas already obtained. Could they have broken into the locked storage area\nand tried to locate the tapes their client wanted? Sure--but then all the\ncompany’s customers, including the law firm, would have certainly been\nnotified of the breach. And the attackers would have lost an advantage:\nProfessionals always like to leave an opening for future access, should the\nneed arise.\nFollowing a standard practice of industrial spies to keep something in the\nback pocket for future use, just in case, they also made a copy of the file\ncontaining the authorization list onto a floppy disk. None of them had any\nidea how it might ever prove useful, but it’s just one of those \"We’re here,\nwe might just as well\" things that every now and then turns out to be\nvaluable.\nThe next day, one of the same men called the storage company, used the\nname they had added to the authorization list, and gave the corresponding\npassword. He asked for all the Jenkins and Petry tapes dated within the\nlast month, and said that a messenger service would come by to pick up\nthe package. By mid-afternoon, Andreeson had the tapes. His people\nrestored all the data to their own computer system, ready to search at\nleisure. Andreeson was very pleased that the law firm, like most other\nbusinesses, didn’t bother encrypting their backup data.\nThe tapes were delivered back to the storage company the next day and no\none was the wiser.\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nValuable information must be protected no matter what form it takes or\nwhere it is located. An organization’s customer list has the same value\nwhether in hardcopy form or an electronic file at your office or in a\nstorage box. Social engineers always prefer the easiest to circumvent,\nleast defended point of attack. A company’s offsite backup storage facility\nis seen as having less risk of detection or getting caught. Every\norganization that stores any valuable, sensitive, or critical data with third\nparties should encrypt their data to protect its confidentiality.\nAnalyzing the Con\nBecause of lax physical security, the bad guys were easily able to pick the\nlock of the storage company, gain access to the computer, and modify the\ndatabase containing the list of people authorized to have access to the\nstorage unit. Adding a name to the list allowed the imposters to obtain the\ncomputer backup tapes they were after, without having to break into the\nfirm’s storage unit. Because most businesses don’t encrypt backup data,\nthe information was theirs for the taking.\nThis incident provides one more example of how a vendor company that\ndoes not exercise reasonable security precautions can make it easy for an\nattacker to compromise their customer’s information assets.\n\nTHE NEW BUSINESS PARTNER\nSocial engineers have a big advantage over con men and grifters, and the\nadvantage is distance. A grifter can only cheat you by being in your\npresence, allowing you to give a good description of him afterward or\neven call the cops if you catch on to the ruse early enough. Social engineers ordinarily avoid that risk like the plague. Sometimes,\nthough, the risk is necessary, and justified by the potential reward. Jessica’s Story\nJessica Andover was feeling very good about getting a job with a hotshot\nrobotics company. Sure, it was only a start-up and they couldn’t pay very\nmuch, but it was small, the people were friendly, and there was the\nexcitement of knowing her stock options just might turn out to make her\nrich. Okay, maybe not a millionaire like the company founders would be,\nbut rich enough. Which was how it happened that Rick Daggot got a glowing smile when\nhe walked into the lobby that Tuesday morning in August. In his\nexpensive- looking suit (Armani) and his heavy gold wrist-watch (a Rolex\nPresident), with his immaculate haircut, he had that same manly, self-\nconfident air that had driven all the girls crazy when Jessica was in high\nschool. \"Hi,\" he said. \"I’m Rick Daggot and I’m here for my meeting with Larry.\"\nJessica’s smile faded. \"Larry?\" she said. \"Larry’s on vacation all week.\" \"I\nhave an appointment with him at one o’clock. I just flew in from\nLouisville to meet with him,\" Rick said, as he drew out his Palm, turned it\non, and showed her. She looked at it and gave a small shake of her head. \"The 20th,\" she said. \"That’s next week.\" He took the palmtop back and stared at it. \"Oh, no!\"\nhe groaned. \"I can’t believe what a stupid mistake I made.\"\n\"Can I book a return flight for you, at least?\" she asked, feeling sorry for\nhim. While she made the phone call, Rick confided that he and Larry had\narranged to set up a strategic marketing alliance. Rick’s company was\nproducing products for the manufacturing and assembly line, items that\nwould perfectly complement their new product, the C2Alpha. Rick’s\nproducts and the C2Alpha together would make a strong solution that\nwould open up important industrial markets for both companies. When Jessica had finished making his reservation on a late afternoon\nflight, Rick said, \"Well, at least I could talk to Steve if he’s available.\" But\nSteve, the company’s VP and cofounder, was also out of the office. Rick, being very friendly to Jessica and flirting just a little, then suggested\nthat, as long as he was there and his flight home wasn’t till late afternoon,\nhe’d like to take some of the key people to lunch. And he added,\n\"Including you, of course--is there somebody who can fill in for you at\nlunchtime. Flushed at the idea of being included, Jessica asked, \"Who do you want\nto come?\" He tapped his palmtop again and named a few people--two\nengineers from R&D, the new sales and marketing man, and the finance\nguy assigned to the project. Rick suggested she tell them about his\nrelationship with the company, and that he’d like to introduce himself to\nthem. He named the best restaurant in the area, a place where Jessica had\nalways wanted to go, and said he’d book the table himself, for 12:30, and\nwould call back later in the morning to make sure everything was all set. When they gathered at the restaurant--the four of them plus Jessica their\ntable wasn’t ready yet, so they settled at the bar, and Rick made it clear\nthat drinks and lunch were on him. Rick was a man with style and class,\nthe kind of person who makes you feel comfortable from the very first,\nthe same way you feel with someone you’ve known for years. He always\nseemed to know just the right thing to say, had a lively remark or\nsomething funny whenever the conversation lagged, and made you feel\ngood just being around him. He shared just enough details about his own company’s products that they\ncould envision the joint marketing solution he seemed so animated about. He named several Fortune 500 companies that his firm was already\nselling to, until everyone at the table began to picture their product\nbecoming a success from the day the first units rolled out of the factory. Then Rick walked over to Brian, one of the engineers. While the others\nchatted among themselves, Rick shared some ideas privately with Brian,\nand drew him out about the unique features of the C2Alpha and what set\nit apart from anything the competition had. He found out about a couple\nof features the company was downplaying that Brian was proud of and\nthought really \"neat.\"\nRick worked his way along the line, chatting quietly with each. The\nmarketing guy was happy for a chance to talk about the roll-out date and\nmarketing plans. And the bean counter pulled an envelope from his pocket\nand wrote down details of the material and manufacturing costs, price\npoint and expected margin, and what kind of deal he was trying to work\nout with each of the vendors, which he listed by name. By the time their table was ready, Rick had exchanged ideas with\neverybody and had won admirers all along the line. By the end of the\nmeal, they each shook hands with Rick in turn and thanked him. Rick\nswapped business cards with each and mentioned in passing to Brian, the\nengineer, that he wanted to have a longer discussion as soon as Larry\nreturned. The following day Brian picked up his telephone to find that the caller\nwas Rick, who said he had just finished speaking with Larry. I’ll be\ncoming back in on Monday to work out some of the specifics with him,\"\nRick said, \"and he wants me to be up to speed on your product. He said\nyou should email the latest designs and specs to him. He’ll pick out the\nparts he wants me to have and forward them on to me.\"\nThe engineer said that would be fine. Good, Rick answered. He went on,\n\"Larry wanted you to know he’s having a problem retrieving his email. Instead of sending the stuff to his regular account, he arranged with the\nhotel’s business center to set up a Yahoo mail account for him. He says\nyou should send the files to larryrobotics@yahoo.com.\"\nThe following Monday morning, when Larry walked into the office\nlooking tanned and relaxed, Jessica was primed and eager to gush over\nRick. \"What a great guy. He took a bunch of us to lunch, even me.\" Larry\nlooked confused. \"Rick? Who the hell is Rick?\"\n\"What’re you talking about?--your new business partner.\" \"What!!!???\"\n\"And everybody was so impressed with what good questions he asked.\" \"I\ndon’t know any Rick ...\"\n\"What’s the matter with you? Is this a joke, Larry--you’re just fooling with\nme, right?\"\n\"Get the executive team into the conference room. Like now. No matter\nwhat they’re doing. And everybody who was at that lunch. Including you.\"\nThey sat around the table in a somber mood, hardly speaking. Larry\nwalked in, sat down and said, \"I do not know anybody named Rick. I do\nnot have a new business partner I’ve been keeping secret from all of you. Which I would have thought was obvious. If there’s a practical ,joker in\nour midst, I want him to speak up now.\"\nNot a sound. The room seemed to be growing darker moment by moment. Finally Brian spoke. \"Why didn’t you say something when I sent you\nthat email with the product specs and source code?\"\n\"What email! ?\"\nBrian stiffened. \"Oh... shit!\"\nCliff, the other engineer, chimed in. \"He gave us all business cards. We\njust need to call him and see what the bell’s going on.\"\nBrian pulled out his palmtop, called up an entry, and scooted the device\nacross the table to Larry. Still hoping against hope, they all watched as if\nentranced while Larry dialed. After a moment, he stabbed the\nspeakerphone button and everyone heard a busy signal. After trying the\nnumber several times over a period of twenty minutes, a frustrated Larry\ndialed the operator to ask for an emergency interruption. A few moments later, the operator came back on the line. She said in a\nchallenging tone, \"Sir, where did you get this number?\" Larry told her it\nwas on the business card of a man he needed to contact urgently. The\noperator, said, \"I’m sorry. That’s a phone company test number. It always\nrings busy.\"\nLarry started making a list of what information had been shared with\nRick. The picture was not pretty. Two police detectives came and took a report. After listening to the story,\nthey pointed out that no state crime had been committed; there was\nnothing they could do. They advised Larry to contact the FBI because\nthey have jurisdiction over any crimes involving interstate commerce. When Rick Daggot asked the engineer to forward the test results by\nmisrepresenting himself, he may have committed a federal crime, but\nRick would have to speak with the FBI to find out. Three months later Larry was in his kitchen reading the morning paper\nover breakfast, and almost spilled his coffee. The thing he had been\ndreading since he had first heard about Rick had come true, his worst\nnightmare. There it was in black and white, on the front page of the\nbusiness section: A company he’d never heard of was announcing the\nrelease of a new product that sounded exactly like the C2Alpha his\ncompany had been developing for the past two years. Through deceit, these people had beaten him to market. His dream was\ndestroyed. The millions of dollars invested in research and development\nwasted. And he probably couldn’t prove a single thing against them. Sammy Sanford’s Story\nSmart enough to be earning a big salary at a legitimate job, but crooked\nenough to prefer making a living as a con man, Sammy Sanford had done\nvery well for himself. In time he came to the attention of a spy who had\nbeen forced into early retirement because of a drinking problem; bitter\nand revengeful, the man had found a way of selling the talents that the\ngovernment had made him an expert in. Always on the lookout for people\nhe could use, he had spotted Sammy the first time they met. Sammy had\nfound it easy, and very profitable, to shift his focus from lifting people’s\nmoney to lifting company secrets. Most people wouldn’t have the guts to do what I do. Try to cheat people\nover the telephone or over the Internet and nobody ever gets to see you. But any good con man, the old-fashioned, face-to-face kind (and there are\nplenty of them still around, more than you would think) can look you in\nthe eye, tell you a whopper, and get you to believe it. I’ve known a\nprosecutor or two who think that’s criminal. I think it’s a talent. But you can’t go walking in blind, you have to size things up first. A street\ncon, you can take a man’s temperature with a little friendly conversation\nand couple of carefully worded suggestions. Get the right responses and\nBingo!--you’ve bagged a pigeon. A company job is more like what we call a big con. You’ve got setup to\ndo. Find out what their buttons are, find out what they want. What they\nneed. Plan an attack. Be patient, do your homework. Figure out the role\nyou’re going to play and learn your lines. And don’t walk in the door until\nyou’re ready. I spent better than three weeks getting up to speed for this one. The client\ngave me a two-day session in what I should say \"my\" company did and\nhow to describe why it was going to be such a good joint marketing\nalliance. Then I got lucky. I called the company and said I was from a venture\ncapital firm and we were interested in setting up a meeting and I was\njuggling schedules to find a time when all of our partners would be\navailable sometime in the next couple of months, and was there any time\nslot I\nshould avoid, any period when Larry wasn’t going to be in town? And she\nsaid, Yes, he hadn’t had any time off in the two years since they started\nthe company but his wife was dragging him away on a golf vacation the\nfirst week in August. That was only two weeks away. I could wait. Meanwhile an industry magazine gave me the name of the firm’s PR\ncompany. I said I liked the amount of space they were getting for their\nrobotics company client and I wanted to talk to whoever was handling that\naccount about handling my company. It turned out to be an energetic\nyoung lady who liked the idea she might be able to bring in a new\naccount. Over a pricey lunch with one more drink than she really wanted,\nshe did her best to convince me they were oh, so good at understanding a\nclient’s problems and finding the right PR solutions. I played hard to\nconvince. I needed some details. With a little prodding, by the time the\nplates were being cleared she had told me more about the new product\nand the company’s problems than I could have hoped for. The thing went like clockwork. The story about being so embarrassed that\nthe meeting was next week but I might as well meet the team as long as\nI’m here, the receptionist swallowed whole. She even felt sorry for me\ninto the bargain. The lunch set me back all of $150. With tip. And I had\nwhat I needed. Phone numbers, job titles, and one very key guy who\nbelieved I was who I said I was.\n\nBrian had me fooled, I admit. He seemed like the kind of guy who’d just\nemail me anything I asked for. But he sounded like he was holding back a\nlittle when I brought up the subject. It pays to expect the unexpected. That\nemail account in Larry’s name, I had it in my back pocket just in case. The\nYahoo security people are probably still sitting there waiting for\nsomebody to use the account again so they can trace him. They’ll have a\nlong wait. The fat lady has sung. I’m off on another project. Analyzing the Con\nAnyone who works a face-to-face con has to cloak himself in a look that\nwill make him acceptable to the mark. He’ll put himself together one way\nto appear at the race track, another to appear at a local watering hole, still\nanother for an upscale bar at a fancy hotel. It’s the same way with industrial espionage. An attack may call for a suit\nand tie and an expensive briefcase if the spy is posing as an executive of\nan established firm, a consultant, or a sales rep. On another job, trying to\npass as a software engineer, a technical person, or someone from the mail\nroom, the clothes, the uniform--the whole look would be different. For infiltrating the company, the man who called himself Rick Daggot\nknew he had to project an image of confidence and competence, backed\nby a thorough knowledge of the company’s product and industry. Not much difficulty laying his hands on the information he needed in\nadvance. He devised an easy ruse to find out when the CEO would be\naway. A small challenge, but still not very tough, was finding out enough\ndetails about the project that he could sound \"on the inside\" about what\nthey were doing. Often this information is known to various company\nsuppliers, as well as investors, venture capitalists they’ve approached\nabout raising money, their banker, and their law firm. The attacker has to\ntake care, though: Finding someone who will part with insider knowledge\ncan be tricky, but trying two or three sources to turn up someone who can\nbe squeezed for information runs the risk that people will catch on to the\ngame. That way lies danger. The Rick Daggots of the world need to pick\ncarefully and tread each information path only once. The lunch was another sticky proposition. First there was the problem of\narranging things so he’d have a few minutes alone with each person, out\nof earshot of the others. He told Jessica 12:30 but booked the table for 1\nP.M., at an upscale, expense-account type of restaurant. He hoped that\nwould mean they’d have to have drinks at the bar, which is exactly what\nhappened. A perfect opportunity to move around and chat with each\nindividual. Still, there were so many ways that a misstep--a wrong answer or a\ncareless remark could reveal Rick to be an imposter. Only a supremely\nconfident and wily industrial spy would dare take a chance of exposing\nhimself that way. But years of working the streets as a confidence man\nhad built Rick’s abilities and given him the confidence that, even if he\nmade a slip, he’d be able to cover it up well enough to quiet any\nsuspicions. This was the most challenging, most dangerous time of the\nentire operation, and the elation he felt at bringing off a sting like this\nmade him realize why he didn’t have to drive fast cars or skydive or cheat\non his wife--he got plenty of excitement just doing his job. How many\npeople, he wondered, could say as much?\n\nMITNICK MESSAGE\nWhile most social engineering attacks occur over the telephone or email,\ndon’t assume that a bold attacker will never appear in person at your\nbusiness. In most cases, the imposter uses some form of social\nengineering to gain access to a building after counterfeiting an employee\nbadge using a commonly available software program such as Photoshop.\nWhat about the business cards with the phone company test line? The\ntelevision show The Rockford Files, which was a series about a private\ninvestigator, illustrated a clever and somewhat humorous technique.\nRockford (played by actor James Garner) had a portable business card\nprinting machine in his car, which he used to print out a card appropriate\nto whatever the occasion called for. These days, a social engineer can get\nbusiness cards printed in an hour at any copy store, or print them on a\nlaser printer.\n\nNOTE\nJohn Le Carre, author of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, A Perfect\nSpy, and many other remarkable books, grew up as the son of a polished,\nengaging lifelong can man. Le Carre was struck as a youngster to discover\nthat, successful as his father was in deceiving other, he was also gullible, a\nvictim more than once to another con man or woman. Which just goes to\nshow that everyone is at risk of being taken in by a social engineer, even\nanother social engineer.\nWhat leads a group of smart men and women to accept an imposter? We\nsize up a situation by both instinct and intellect. If the story adds up--\nthat’s the intellect part--and a con man manages to project a believable\nimage, we’re usually willing to let down our guard. It’s the believable\nimage that separates a successful con man or social engineer from one\nwho quickly lands behind bars.\nAsk yourself: How sure am I that I would never fall for a story like\nRick’s? If you’re sure you wouldn’t, ask yourself whether anyone has ever\nput anything over on you. If the answer to this second question is yes, it’s\nprobably the correct answer to the first question, as well.\n\nLEAPFROG\nA challenge: The following story does not involve industrial espionage.\nAs you read it, see if you can understand why I decided to put it in this\nchapter!\nHarry Tardy was back living at home, and he was bitter. The Marine\nCorps had seemed like a great escape until he washed out of boot camp.\nNow he had returned to the hometown he hated, was taking computer\ncourses at the local community college,\" and looking for a way to strike\nout at the world.\nFinally he hit upon a plan. Over beers with a guy in one of his classes,\nhe’d been complaining about their instructor, a sarcastic know-it-all, and\ntogether they cooked up a wicked scheme to burn the guy: They’d grab\nthe source code for a popular personal digital assistant (PDA) and have it\nsent to the instructor’s computer, and make sure to leave a trail so the\ncompany would think the instructor was the bad guy.\nThe new friend, Karl Alexander, said he \"knew a few tricks\" and would\ntell Harry how to bring this off. Arid get away with it.\nDoing Their Homework\nA little initial research showed Harry that the product had been\nengineered at the Development Center located at the PDA manufacturer’s\nheadquarters overseas. But there was also an R&D facility in the United\nStates. That was good, Karl pointed out, because for the attempt to work\nthere had to be some company facility in the United States that also\nneeded access to the source code.\nAt that point Harry was ready to call the overseas Development Center.\nHere’s where a plea for sympathy came in, the \"Oh, dear, I’m in trouble, I\nneed help, please, please, help me.\" Naturally the plea was a little more\nsubtle than that. Karl wrote out a script, but Harry sounded completely\nphony trying to read it. In the end, he practiced with Karl so he could say\nwhat he needed to in a conversational tone.\nWhat Harry finally said, with Karl sitting by his side, went something like\nthis:\n\"I’m calling from R&D Minneapolis. Our server had a worm that infected\nthe whole department. We had to install the operating system again and\nthen when we went to restore from backup, none of the backups was any\ngood. Guess who was supposed to be checking the integrity of the\nbackups? Yours truly. So I’m getting yelled at by my boss, and\nmanagement is up in arms that we’ve lost the data. Look, I need to have\nthe latest revision of the source-code tree as quick as you can. I need you\nto gzip the source code and send it to me.\"\nAt this point Karl scribbled him a note, and Harry told the man on the\nother end of the phone that he just wanted him to transfer the file\ninternally, to Minneapolis R&D. This was highly important: When the\nman on the other end of the phone was clear that he was just being asked\nto send the file to another part of the company, his mind was at ease--what\ncould be wrong with that?\n\nLINGO\nGZIP To archive files in a single compressed file using a Linux GNU\nutility.\nHe agreed to gzip and send it. Step by step, with Karl at his elbow, Harry\ntalked the man there through getting started on the procedure for\ncompressing the huge source code into a single, compact file. He also\ngave him a file name to use on the compressed file, \"newdata,\" explaining\nthat this name would avoid any confusion with their old, corrupted files.\nKarl had to explain the next step twice before Harry got it, but it was\ncentral to the little game of leapfrog Karl had dreamed up. Harry was to\ncall R&D Minneapolis and tell somebody there \"I want to send a file to\nyou, and then I want you to send it somewhere else for me\"(cid:151)of course all\ndressed up with reasons that would make it all sound plausible. What\nconfused Harry was this: He was supposed to say \"I(cid:146)m going to send you\na file,\" when it wasn’t going to be Harry sending the file at all. He had to\nmake the guy he was talking to at the R&D Center think the file was\ncoming from him, when what the Center was really going to receive was\nthe file of proprietary source code from Europe. \"Why would I tell him it’s\ncoming from me when it’s really coming from overseas?\" Harry wanted to\nknow.\n\"The guy at the R&D Center is the linchpin,\" Karl explained. \"He’s got to\nthink he’s just doing a favor for a fellow employee here in the U.S.,\ngetting a file from you and then just forwarding it for you.\"\nHarry finally understood. He called the R&D Center, where he asked the\nreceptionist to connect him to the Computer Center, where he asked to\nspeak to a computer operator. A guy came on the line who sounded as\nyoung as Harry himself. Harry greeted him, explained he was calling from\nthe Chicago fabricating division of the company and that he had this file\nhe’d been trying to send to one of their partners working on a project with\nthem, but, he said, \"We’ve got this router problem and can’t reach their\nnetwork. I’d like to transfer the file to you, and after you receive it, I’ll\nphone you so I can walk you through transferring it to the partner’s\ncomputer.\nSo far, so good. Harry then asked the young man whether his computer\ncenter had an anonymous FTP account, a setup that allows anyone to\ntransfer files in and out of a directory where no password is required. Yes,\nan anonymous FTP was available, and he gave Harry the internal Internet\nProtocol (IP) address for reaching it.\n\nLINGO\nANONYMOUS FTP A program that provides access to a remote\ncomputer even though you don(cid:146)t have an account by using the File\nTransfer protocol (FTP). Although anonymous FTP can be accessed\nwithout a password, generally user-access rights to certain folders are\nrestricted.\nWith that information in hand, Harry called back the Development Center\noverseas. By now the compressed file was ready, and Harry gave the\ninstructions for transferring the file to the anonymous FTP site. In less\nthan five minutes, the compressed source-code file was sent to the kid at\nthe R&D Center.\nSetting Up the Victim\nHalfway to the goal. Now Harry and Karl had to wait to make sure the file\nhad arrived before proceeding. During the wait, they walked across the\nroom to the instructor’s desk and took care of two other necessary steps.\nThey first set up an anonymous FTP server on his machine, which would\nserve as a destination for the file in the last leg of their scheme.\nThe second step provided a solution for an otherwise tricky problem.\nClearly they couldn’t tell their man at the R&D Center to send the file to\nan address such as, say, warren@rms.ca.edu. The \".edu\" domain would be\na dead giveaway, since any half-awake computer guy would recognize it\nas the address of a school, immediately blowing the whole operation. To\navoid this, they went into Windows on the instructor’s computer and\nlooked up the machine’s IP address, which they would give as the address\nfor sending the file.\nBy then it was time to call back the computer operator at the R&D Center.\nHarry got him on the phone and said, \"I just transferred the file that I\ntalked to you about. Can you check that you received it \"\nYes, it had arrived. Harry then asked him to try forwarding it, and gave\nhim the IP address. He stayed on the phone while the young man made\nthe connection and started transmitting the file, and they watched with big\ngrins from across the room as the light on the hard drive of the instructor’s\ncomputer blinked and blinked--busy receiving the download.\nHarry exchanged a couple of remarks with the guy about how maybe one\nday computers and peripherals would be more reliable, thanked him and\nsaid goodbye.\nThe two copied the file from the instructor’s machine onto a pair of Zip\ndisks, one for each of them, just so they could look at it later, like stealing\na painting from a museum that you can enjoy yourself but don’t dare show\nto your friends. Except, in this case, it was more like they had taken a\nduplicate original of the painting, and the museum still had their own\noriginal.\nKarl then talked Harry through the steps of removing the FTP server from\nthe instructor’s machine, and erasing the audit trail so there would be no\nevidence of what they had done--only the stolen file, left where it could be\nlocated easily.\nAs a final step, they posted a section of the source code on Usenet directly\nfrom the instructor’s computer. Only a section, so they wouldn’t do any\ngreat damage to the company, but leaving clear tracks directly back to the\ninstructor. He would have some difficult explaining to do.\nAnalyzing the Con\nAlthough it took the combination of a number of elements to make this\nescapade work, it could not have succeeded without some skill-ful\nplayacting of an appeal for sympathy and help: I’m getting yelled at by my\nboss, and management is up in arms, and so on. That, combined with a\npointed explanation of how the man on the other end of the phone could\nhelp solve the problem, proved to be a powerfully convincing con. It\nworked here, and has worked many other times.\nThe second crucial element: The man who understood the value of the file\nwas asked to send it to an address within the company.\nAnd the third piece of the puzzle: The computer operator could see that\nthe file had been transferred to him from within the company. That could\nonly mean--or so it seemed--that the man who sent it to him could himself\nhave sent it on to the final destination if only his external network\nconnection had been working. What could possibly be wrong with helping\nhim out by sending it for him?\nBut what about having the compressed file assigned a different name?\nSeemingly a small item, but an important one. The attacker couldn’t afford\ntaking a chance of the file arriving with a name identifying it as source\ncode, or a name related to the product. A request to send a file with a\nname like that outside the company might have set off alarm bells. Having\nthe file re-labeled with an innocuous name was crucial. As worked out by\nthe attackers, the second young man had no qualms about sending the file\noutside the company; a file with a name like new data, giving no clue as\nto the true nature of the information, would hardly make him suspicious.\n\nMITNICK MESSGAE\nThe underlying rule that every employee should have firmly planted in his\nor her brain: Except with management approval, don’t transfer files to\npeople you don’t personally know, even if the destination appears to be\nwithin your company’s internal network.\nFinally, did you figure out what this story is doing in a chapter on\nindustrial espionage? If not, here’s the answer: What these two students\ndid as a malicious prank could just as easily have been done by a\nprofessional industrial spy, perhaps in the pay of a competitor, or perhaps\nin the pay of a foreign government. Either way, the damage could have\nbeen devastating to the company, severely eroding the sales of their new\nproduct once the competitive product reached the market.\nHow easily could the same type of attack be carried out against your\ncompany?\n\nPREVENTING THE CON\nIndustrial espionage, which has long been a challenge to businesses, has\nnow become the bread and butter of traditional spies who have focused\ntheir efforts on obtaining company secrets for a price, now that the Cold\nWar has ended. Foreign governments and corporations are now using\nfreelance industrial spies to steal information. Domestic companies also\nhire information brokers who cross the line in their efforts to obtain\ncompetitive intelligence. In many cases these are former military spies\nturned industrial information brokers who have the prerequisite\nknowledge and experience to easily exploit organizations, especially those\nthat have failed to deploy safeguards to protect their information and\neducate their people.\nSafety Off-Site\nWhat could have helped the company that ran into problems with their\noff-site storage facility? The danger here could have been avoided if the\ncompany had been encrypting their data. Yes, encryption requires extra\ntime and expense, but it’s well worth the effort. Encrypted files need to be\nspot-checked regularly to be sure that the encryption/decryption is\nworking smoothly.\nThere’s always the danger that the encryption keys will be lost or that the\nonly person who knows the keys will be hit by a bus. But the nuisance\nlevel can be minimized, and anyone who stores sensitive information off-\nsite with a commercial firm and does not use encryption is, excuse me for\nbeing blunt, an idiot. It’s like walking down the street in a bad\nneighborhood with twenty-dollar bills sticking out of your pockets,\nessentially asking to be robbed.\nLeaving backup media where someone could walk off with it is a\ncommon flaw in security. Several years ago, I was employed at a firm\nthat could have made better efforts to protect client information. The\noperation’s staff left the firm’s backup tapes outside the locked computer\nroom door for a messenger to pick up each day. Anyone could have\nwalked off with the backup tapes, which contained all of the firm’s word-\nprocessed documents in unencrypted text. If backup data is encrypted,\nloss of the material is a nuisance; if it’s not encrypted--well, you can\nenvision the impact on your company better than I can.\nThe need in larger companies for reliable offsite storage is pretty much a\ngiven. But your company’s security procedures need to include an\ninvestigation of your storage company to see how conscientious they are\nabout their own security policies and practices. If they’re not as dedicated\nas your own company, all your security efforts could be undermined.\nSmaller companies have a good alternate choice for backup: Send the new\nand changed files each night to one of the companies offering online\nstorage. Again, it’s essential that the data be encrypted. Otherwise, the\ninformation is available not just to a bent employee at the storage\ncompany but to every computer intruder who can breach the on-line\nstorage companys computer systems or network.\nAnd of course, when you set up an encryption system to protect the\nsecurity of your backup files, you must also set up a highly secure proce\ndure for storing the encryption keys or the pass phrases that unlock them.\nSecret keys used to encrypt data should be stored in a safe or vault.\nStandard company practice needs to provide for the possibility that the\nemployee handling this data could suddenly leave, die, or take another\njob. There must always be at least two people who know the storage place\nand the encryption/decryption procedures, as well as the policies for how\nand when keys are to be changed. The policies must also require that\nencryption keys be changed immediately upon the departure of any\nemployee who had access to them.\nWho Is That?\nThe example in this chapter of a slick con artist who uses charm to get\nemployees to share information reinforces the importance of verification\nof identity. The request to have source code forwarded to an FTP site also\npoints to the importance of knowing your requester.\nIn Chapter 16 you will find specific policies for verifying the identity of\nany stranger who makes a request for information or a request that some\naction be taken. We’ve talked about the need for verification throughout\nthe book; in Chapter 16 you’ll get specifics of how this should be done.\nPart 4\nRaising the bar\nInformation Security Awareness and\nTraining\nA social engineer has been given the assignment of obtaining the plans to\nyour hot new product due for release in two months.\nWhat’s going to stop him?\nYour firewall? No.\nStrong authentication devices? No. Intrusion detection systems? No.\nEncryption? No.\nLimited access to phone numbers for dial-up modems? No.\nCode names for servers that make it difficult for an outsider to determine\nwhich server might contain the product plans? No.\nThe truth is that there is no technology in the world that can prevent a\nsocial engineering attack.\nSECURITY THROUGH TECHNOLOGY, TRAINING, AND\n\nPROCEDURES\nCompanies that conduct security penetration tests report that their\nattempts to break into client company computer systems by social\nengineering methods are nearly 100 percent successful. Security\ntechnologies can make these types of attacks more difficult by removing\npeople from the decision-making process. However the only truly\neffective way to mitigate the threat of social engineering is through the\nuse of security technologies combined with security policies that set\nground rules for employee behavior, and appropriate education and\ntraining for employees.\nThere is only one way to keep your product plans safe and that is by\nhaving a trained, aware, and a conscientious workforce. This involves\ntraining on the policies and procedures, but also--and probably even more\nimportant--an ongoing awareness program. Some authorities recommend\nthat 40 percent of a company’s overall security budget be targeted to\nawareness training.\nThe first step is to make everyone in the enterprise aware that\nunscrupulous people exist who will use deception to psychologically\nmanipulate them. Employees must be educated about what information\nneeds to be protected, and how to protect it. Once people have a better\nunderstanding of how they can be manipulated, they are in a far better\nposition to recognize that an attack is underway.\nSecurity awareness also means educating everyone in the enterprise on the\ncompany’s security policies and procedures. As discussed in Chapter 17,\npolicies are necessary rules to guide employee behavior to protect\ncorporate information systems and sensitive information.\nThis chapter and the next one provide a security blueprint that could save\nyou from costly attacks. If you don’t have trained and alert employees\nfollowing well-thought-out procedures, it’s not a matter of if, but when\nyou will lose valuable information to a social engineer. Don’t wait for an\nattack to happen to you before instituting these policies: It could be\ndevastating to your business and to your employees’ welfare.\n\nUNDERSTANDING HOW ATTACKERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF\n\nHUMAN NATURE\nTo develop a successful training program, you have to understand why\npeople are vulnerable to attacks in the first place. By identifying these\ntendencies in your training--for example, by drawing attention to them in\nrole-playing discussions--you can help your employees to understand why\nwe can all be manipulated by social engineers.\nManipulation has been studied by social scientists for at least fifty years.\nRobert B. Cialdini, writing in Scientific American (February 2001),\nsummarized this research, presenting six \"basic tendencies of human\nnature\" that are involved in an attempt to obtain compliance to a request.\nThese six tendencies are those that social engineers rely on (consciously\nor, most often, unconsciously) in their attempts to manipulate.\nAuthority\nPeople have a tendency to comply when a request is made by a person in\nauthority. As discussed elsewhere in these pages, a person can be\nconvinced to comply with a request if he or she believes the requestor is a\nperson in authority or a person who is authorized to make such a request.\nIn his book Influence, Dr. Cialdini writes of a study at three Midwestern\nhospitals in which twenty-two separate nurses’ stations were contacted by\na caller who claimed to be a hospital physician, and given instructions for\nadministering a prescription drug to a patient on the ward. The nurses who\nreceived these instructions did not know the caller. They did not even\nknow whether he was really a doctor (he was not). They received the\ninstructions for the prescription by telephone, which was a violation of\nhospital policy. The drug they were told to administer was not authorized\nfor use on the wards, and the dosage they were told to administer was\ntwice the maximum daily dosage, and thus could have endangered the life\nof the patient. Yet in 95 percent of the cases, Cialdini reported, \"the nurse\nproceeded to obtain the necessary dosage from the ward medicine cabinet\nand was on her way to administer it to the patient\" before being\nintercepted by an observer and told of the experiment.\nExamples of attacks: A social engineer attempts to cloak himself in the\nmantle of authority by claiming that he is with the IT department, or that\nhe is an executive or works for an executive in the company.\nLiking\nPeople have the tendency to comply when the person making a request\nhas been able to establish himself as likable, or as having similar interests,\nbeliefs, and attitudes as the victim.\nExamples of attacks: Through conversation, the attacker manages to\nlearn a hobby or interest of the victim, and claims an interest and\nenthusiasm for the same hobby or interest. Or he may claim to be from the\nsame state or school, or to have similar goals. The social engineer will\nalso attempt to mimic the behaviors of his target to create the appearance\nof similarity.\nReciprocation\nWe may automatically comply with a request when we have been given or\npromised something of value. The gift may be a material item, or advice,\nor help. When someone has done something for you, you feel an\ninclination to reciprocate. This strong tendency to reciprocate exists even\nin situations where the person receiving the gift hasn’t asked for it. One of\nthe most effective ways to influence people to do us a \"favor\" (comply\nwith a request) is by giving some gift r assistance that forms an\nunderlying obligation.\nMembers of the Hare Krishna religious cult were very effective at\ninfluencing people to donate to their cause by first giving them a book or\nflower as a gift. If the recipient tried to return the gift, the giver would\nrefuse remarking, \"It’s our gift to you.\" This behavioral principle of\nreciprocation was used by the Krishnas to substantially increase\ndonations.\nExamples of attacks: An employee receives a call from a person who\nidentifies himself as being from the IT department. The caller explains\nthat some company computers have been infected with a new virus not\nrecognized by the antivirus software that can destroy all files on a\ncomputer, and offers to talk the person through some steps to prevent\nproblems. Following this, the caller asks the person to test a software\nutility that has just been recently upgraded for allowing users to change\npasswords. The employee is reluctant to refuse, because the caller has just\nprovided help that will supposedly protect the user from a virus. He\nreciprocates by complying with the caller’s request.\nConsistency\nPeople have the tendency to comply after having made a public\ncommitment or endorsement for a cause. Once we have promised we will\ndo something, we don’t want to appear untrustworthy or undesirable and\nwill tend to follow through in order to be consistent with our statement or\npromise.\nExample of attack: The attacker contacts a relatively new employee and\nadvises her of the agreement to abide by certain security policies and\nprocedures as a condition of being allowed to use company information\nsystems. After discussing a few security practices, the caller asks the user\nfor her password \"to verify compliance\" with policy on choosing a\ndifficult-to-guess password. Once the user reveals her password, the caller\nmakes a recommendation to construct future passwords in such a way that\nthe attacker will be able to guess it. The victim complies because of her\nprior agreement to abide by company policies and her assumption that the\ncaller is merely verifying her compliance.\nSocial Validation\nPeople have the tendency to comply when doing so appears to be in line\nwith what others are doing. The action of others is accepted as validation\nthat the behavior in question is the correct and appropriate action.\nExamples of attacks: The caller says he is conducting a survey and\nnames other people in the department who he claims have already\ncooperated with him. The victim, believing that cooperation by others\nvalidates the authenticity of the request, agrees to take part. The caller\nthen asks a series of questions, among which are questions that draw the\nvictim into revealing his computer username and password.\nScarcity\nPeople have the tendency to comply when it is believed that the object\nsought is in short supply and others are competing for it, or that it is\navailable only for a short period of time.\nExample of attack: The attacker sends emails claiming that the first 500\npeople to register at the company’s new Web site will win free tickets to a\nhot new movie. When an unsuspecting employee registers at the site, he is\nasked to provide his company email address and to choose a password.\nMany people, motivated by convenience, have the propensity to use the\nsame or a similar password on every computer system they use. Taking\nadvantage of this, the attacker then attempts to compromise the target’s\nwork and home computer systems with the username and password that\nhave been entered during the Web site registration process.\n\nCREATING TRAINING AND AWARENESS PROGRAMS\nIssuing an information security policy pamphlet or directing employees to\nan intranet page that details security policies will not, by itself, mitigate\nyour risk. Every business must not only define the rules with written\npolicies, but must make the extra effort to direct everyone who works\nwith corporate information or computer systems to learn and follow the\nrules. Furthermore, you must ensure that everyone understands the reason\nbehind each policy so that people don’t circumvent the rule as a matter of\nconvenience. Otherwise, ignorance will always be the worker’s excuse,\nand the precise vulnerability that social engineers will exploit.\nThe central goal of any security awareness program is to influence people\nto change their behavior and attitudes by motivating every employee\nto want to chip in and do his part to protect the organization’s information\nassets. A great motivator in this instance is to explain how their\nparticipation will benefit not just the company, but the individual\nemployees as well. Since the company retains certain private information\nabout every worker, when employees do their part to protect information\nor information systems, they are actually protecting their own\ninformation, too.\nA security training program requires substantial support. The training\neffort needs to reach every person who has access to sensitive information\nor corporate computer systems, must be on-going, and must be\ncontinuously revised to update personnel on new threats and\nvulnerabilities. Employees must see that senior management is fully\ncommitted to the program. That commitment must be real, not just a\nrubber-stamped \"We give our blessings\" memo. And the program must be\nbacked up with sufficient resources to develop, communicate, test it, and\nto measure success.\nGoals\nThe basic guideline that should be kept in mind during development of an\ninformation security training and awareness program is that the program\nneeds to focus on creating in all employees an awareness that their\ncompany might be under attack at any time. They must learn that each\nemployee plays a role in defending against any attempt to gain entry to\ncomputer systems or to steal sensitive data.\nBecause many aspects of information security involve technology, it’s too\neasy for employees to think that the problem is being handled by firewalls\nand other security technologies. A primary goal of training should be to\ncreate awareness in each employee that they are the front line needed to\nprotect the overall security of the organization.\nSecurity training must have a significantly greater aim than simply\nimparting rules. The training program designer must recognize the strong\ntemptation on the part of employees, under pressure of getting their jobs\ndone, to overlook or ignore their security responsibilities. Knowledge\nabout the tactics of social engineering and how to defend against the\nattacks is important, but it will only be of value if the training is designed\nto focus heavily on motivating employees to use the knowledge.\nThe company can count the program as meeting its bottom-line goal if\neveryone completing the training is thoroughly convinced and motivated\nby one basic notion: that information security is part of his or her job.\nEmployees must come to appreciate and accept that the threat of social\nengineering attacks is real, and that a serious loss of sensitive corporate\ninformation could endanger the company as well as their own personal\ninformation and jobs. In a sense, being careless about information security\nat work is equivalent to being careless with one’s ATM PIN or credit card\nnumber. This can be a compelling analogy for building enthusiasm for\nsecurity practices.\nEstablishing the Training and Awareness Program\nThe person responsible for designing the information security program\nneeds to recognize that this is not a one-size-fits-all project. Rather, the\ntraining needs to be developed to suit the specific requirements of several\ndifferent groups within the enterprise. While many of the security policies\noutlined in Chapter 16 apply to all employees across the board, many\nothers are unique. At a minimum, most companies will need training\nprograms tailored to these distinct groups: managers; IT personnel;\ncomputer users; non-technical personnel; administrative assistants;\nreceptionists; and security guards. (See the breakdown of policies by job\nassignment in Chapter 16.)\nSince the personnel of a company’s industrial security force are not\nordinarily expected to be computer proficient, and, except perhaps in a\nvery limited way, do not come into contact with company computers, they\nare not usually considered when designing training of this kind. However,\nsocial engineers can deceive security guards or others into allowing them\ninto a building or office, or into performing an action that results in a\ncomputer intrusion. While members of the guard force certainly don’t\nneed the full training of personnel who operate or use computers,\nnonetheless they must not be overlooked in the security awareness\nprogram.\nWithin the corporate world there are probably few subjects about which\nall employees need to be educated that are simultaneously as important\nand as inherently dull as security. The best designed information security\ntraining programs must both inform and capture the attention and\nenthusiasm of the learners.\nThe aim should be to make security information awareness and training\nan engaging and interactive experience. Techniques could include\ndemonstrating social engineering methods through role-playing;\nreviewing media reports of recent attacks on other less fortunate\nbusinesses and discussing the ways the companies could have prevented\nthe loss; or showing a security video that’s entertaining and educational at\nthe same time. There are several security awareness companies that\nmarket videos and related materials.\n\nNOTE\nFor those businesses that do not have the resources to develop a program\nin-house, there are several training companies that offer security\nawareness training services. Trade shows such as Secure World Expo\n(www.secureworldexpo.com) are gathering places for these companies\nThe stories in this book provide plenty of material to explain the methods\nand tactics of social engineering, to raise awareness of the threat, and to\ndemonstrate the vulnerabilities in human behavior. Consider using their\nscenarios as a basis for role-playing activities. The stories also offer\ncolorful opportunities for lively discussion on how the victims could have\nresponded differently to prevent the attacks from being successful.\nA skillful course developer and skillful trainers will find plenty of\nchallenges, but also plenty of opportunities, for keeping the classroom\ntime lively, and, in the process, motivate people to become part of the\nsolution.\nStructure of the Training\nA basic security awareness training program should be developed that all\nemployees are required to attend. New employees should be required to\nattend the training as part of their initial indoctrination. I recommend that\nno employee be provided computer access until he has attended a basic\nsecurity awareness session.\nFor this initial awareness and training, I suggest a session focused enough\nto hold attention, and short enough that the important messages will be\nremembered. While the amount of material to be covered certainly\njustifies longer training, the importance of providing awareness and\nmotivation along with a reasonable number of essential messages in my\nview outweighs any notion of half-day or full-day sessions that leave\npeople numb with too much information.\nThe emphasis of these sessions should be on conveying an appreciation of\nthe harm that can be done to the company, and to employees individually,\nunless all employees follow good security work habits. More important\nthan learning about specific security practices is the motivation that leads\nemployees to accept personal responsibility for security.\nIn situations where some employees cannot readily attend classroom\nsessions, the company should consider developing awareness training\nusing other forms of instruction, such as videos, computer-based training,\nonline courses, or written materials.\nAfter the initial short training session, longer sessions should be designed\nto educate employees about specific vulnerabilities and attack techniques\nrelative to their position in the company. Refresher training should be\nrequired at least once a year. The nature of the threat and the methods\nused to exploit people are ever-changing, so the content of the program\nshould be kept up to date. Moreover, people’s awareness and alertness\ndiminish over time, so training must be repeated at reasonable intervals to\nreinforce security principles. Here again the emphasis needs to be as much\non keeping employees convinced of the importance of security policies\nand motivated to adhere to them, as on exposing specific threats and\nsocial engineering methods.\nManagers must allow reasonable time for their subordinates to become\nfamiliar with security policies and procedures, and to participate in the\nsecurity awareness program. Employees should not be expected to study\nsecurity policies or attend security classes on their own time. New\nemployees should be given ample time to review security policies and\npublished security practices prior to beginning their job responsibilities.\nEmployees who change positions within the organization to a job that\ninvolves access to sensitive information or computer systems should, of\ncourse, be required to complete a security training program tailored to\ntheir new responsibilities. For example, when a computer operator\nbecomes a systems administrator, or a receptionist becomes an\nadministrative assistant, new training is required.\nTraining Course Contents\nWhen reduced to their fundamentals, all social engineering attacks have\nthe same common element: deception. The victim is led to believe that the\nattacker is a fellow employee or some other person who is authorized to\naccess sensitive information, or authorized to give the victim instructions\nthat involve taking actions with a computer or computer-related\nequipment. Almost all of these attacks could be foiled if the targeted\nemployee simply follows two steps:\nVerify the identity of the person making the request: Is the person making\nthe request really who he claims to be?\nVerify whether the person is authorized: Does the person have the need to\nknow, or is he otherwise authorized to make this request?\n\nNOTE\nBecause security awareness and training are never perfect, use security\ntechnologies whenever possible to create a system of defense in depth.\nThis means that the security measure is provided by the technology rather\nthan by individual employees, for example, when the operating system is\nconfigured to prevent employees from downloading software from the\nInternet, or choosing a short, easily guessed password.\nIf awareness training sessions could change behavior so that each\nemployee would always be consistent about testing any request against\nthese criteria, the risk associated with social engineering attacks would be\ndramatically reduced.\nA practical information security awareness and training program that\naddresses human behavior and social engineering aspects should include\nthe following:\nA description of how attackers use social engineering skills to deceive\npeople.\nThe methods used by social engineers to accomplish their objectives.\nHow to recognize a possible social engineering attack.\nThe procedure for handling a suspicious request.\nWhere to report social engineering attempts or successful attacks.\nThe importance of challenging anyone who makes a suspicious request,\nregardless of the person’s claimed position or importance.\nThe fact that they should not implicitly trust others without proper\nverification, even though their impulse is to give others the benefit of the\ndoubt.\nThe importance of verifying the identity and authority of any person\nmaking a request for information or action. (See \"Verification and\nAuthorization Procedures,\" Chapter 16, for ways to verify identity.)\nProcedures for protecting sensitive information, including familiarity with\nany data classification system.\nThe location of the company’s security policies and procedures, and their\nimportance to the protection of information and corporate information\nsystems.\nA summary of key security policies and an explanation of their meaning.\nFor example, every employee should be instructed in how to devise a\ndifficult-to-guess password.\nThe obligation of every employee to comply with the policies, and the\nconsequences for non-compliance.\nSocial engineering by definition involves some kind of human interaction.\nAn attacker will very frequently use a variety of communication methods\nand technologies in attempting to achieve his or her goal. For this reason,\na well-rounded awareness program should attempt to cover some or all of\nthe following:\nSecurity policies related to computer and voice mail passwords.\nThe procedure for disclosing sensitive information or materials.\nEmail usage policy, including the safeguards to prevent malicious code\nattacks including viruses, worms, and Trojan Horses.\nPhysical security requirements such as wearing a badge.\nThe responsibility to challenge people on the premises who aren’t wearing\na badge.\nBest security practices of voice mail usage.\nHow to determine the classification of information, and the proper\nsafeguards for protecting sensitive information.\nProper disposal of sensitive documents and computer media that contain,\nor have at any time in the past contained, confidential materials.\nAlso, if the company plans to use penetration testing to determine the\neffectiveness of defenses against social engineering attacks, a warning\nshould be given putting employees on notice of this practice. Let\nemployees know that at some time they may receive a phone call or other\ncommunication using an attacker’s techniques as part of such a test. Use\nthe results of those tests not to punish, bur to define the need for\nadditional training in some areas.\nDetails concerning all of the above items will be found in Chapter 16.\n\nTESTING\nYour company may want to test employees on their mastery of the\ninformation presented in the security awareness training, before allowing\ncomputer system access. If you design tests to be given on line, many\nassessment design software programs allow you to readily analyze test\nresults to determine areas of the training that need to be strengthened.\nYour company may also consider providing a certificate testifying to the\ncompletion of the security training as a reward and employee motivator.\nAs a routine part of completing the program, it is recommended that each\nemployee be asked to sign an agreement to abide by the security policies\nand principles taught in the program. Research suggests that a person who\nmakes the commitment of signing such an agreement is more likely to\nmake an effort to abide by the procedures.\n\nONGOING AWARENESS\nMost people are aware that learning, even about important matters, tends\nto fade unless reinforced periodically. Because of the importance of\nkeeping employees up to speed on the subject of defending against social\nengineering attacks, an ongoing awareness program is vital.\nOne method to keep security at the forefront of employee thinking is to\nmake information security a specific job responsibility for every person in\nthe enterprise. This encourages employees to recognize their crucial role\nin the overall security of the company. Otherwise there is a strong\ntendency to feel that security \"is not my job.\"\nWhile overall responsibility for an information security program is\nnormally assigned to a person in the security department or the\ninformation technology department, development of an information\nsecurity awareness program is probably best structured as a joint project\nwith the training department.\nThe ongoing awareness program needs to be creative and use every\navailable channel for communicating security messages in ways that are\nmemorable so that employees are constantly reminded about good\nsecurity habits. Methods should use all of the traditional channels, plus as\nmany non-traditional ones as the people assigned to develop and\nimplement the program can imagine. As with traditional advertising,\nhumor and cleverness help. Varying the wording of messages keeps them\nfrom becoming so familiar that they are ignored.\nThe list of possibilities for an ongoing awareness program might include:\nProviding copies of this book to all employees.\nIncluding informational items in the company newsletter: articles, boxed\nreminders (preferably short, attention-getting items), or cartoons, for\nexample.\nPosting a picture of the Security Employee of the Month.\nHanging posters in employee areas.\nPosting bulletin-board notices.\nProviding printed enclosures in paycheck envelopes.\nSending email reminders.\nUsing security-related screen savers.\nBroadcasting security reminder announcements through the voice mail\nsystem.\nPrinting phone stickers with messages such as \"Is your caller who he says\nhe is?’!\nSetting up reminder messages to appear on the computer when logging in,\nsuch as \"If you are sending confidential information in an email, encrypt\nit.\"\nIncluding security awareness as a standard item on employee performance\nreports and annual reviews.\nProviding security awareness reminders on the intranet, perhaps using\ncartoons or humor, or in some other way enticing employees to read them.\nUsing an electronic message display board in the cafeteria, with a\nfrequently changing security reminder.\nDistributing flyers or brochures.\nAnd think gimmicks, such as free fortune cookies in the cafeteria, each\ncontaining a security reminder instead of a fortune.\nThe threat is constant; the reminders must be constant as well.\nWHAT’S IN IT FOR ME?\"\nIn addition to security awareness and training programs, I strongly\nrecommend an active and well-publicized reward program. You must\nacknowledge employees who have detected and prevented an attempted\nsocial engineering attack, or in some other way significantly contributed\nto the success of the information security program. The existence of the\nreward program should be made known to employees at all security\nawareness sessions, and security violations should be widely publicized\nthroughout the organization.\nOn the other side of the coin, people must be made aware of the\nconsequences of failing to abide by information security policies, whether\nthrough carelessness or resistance. Though we all make mistakes,\nrepeated violations of security procedures must not be tolerated.",
    "question": "What are the key steps and strategies that social engineers use to gain access to sensitive information and how can organizations protect themselves from such attacks?",
    "summary": "Industrial espionage is a real and growing threat, with attacks like hacking into offsite storage facilities and social engineering being common methods. The case of Rick Daggot shows how a con artist can manipulate employees by posing as a trusted business partner, gaining access to sensitive information. To prevent such attacks, companies must implement strong encryption for offsite data storage and ensure employees are trained to verify the identity and authority of anyone requesting sensitive information. Effective security awareness programs are crucial, as they help employees recognize and resist social engineering tactics, making them an essential part of any organization's defense against information theft."

    "text": "Chapter 16\nRecommended Corporate Information Security Policies\nNine out of every ten large corporations and government agencies have\nbeen attacked by computer intruders, to judge from the results of a survey\nconducted by the FBI and reported by the Associated Press in April 2002.\nInterestingly, the study found that only about one company in three\nreported or publicly acknowledged any attacks. That reticence to reveal\ntheir victimization makes sense. To avoid loss of customer confidence and\nto prevent further attacks by intruders who learn that a company may be\nvulnerable, most businesses do not publicly report computer security\nincidents.\nIt appears that there are no statistics on social engineering attacks, and if\nthere were, the numbers would be highly unreliable; in most cases a\ncompany never knows when a social engineer has \"stolen\" information, so\nmany attacks go unnoticed and unreported.\nEffective countermeasures can be put into place against most types of\nsocial engineering attacks. But let’s face reality here--unless everyone in\nthe enterprise understands that security is important and makes it his or\nher business to know and adhere to a company’s security policies, social\nengineering attacks will always present a grave risk to the enterprise.\nIn fact, as improvements are made if I the technological weapons against\nsecurity breaches, the social engineering approach to using people to\naccess proprietary company information or penetrate the corporate\nnetwork will almost certainly become significantly more frequent and\nattractive to information thieves. An industrial spy will naturally attempt\nto\naccomplish his or her objective using the easiest method and the one\ninvolving the least risk of detection. As a matter of fact, a company that\nhas protected its computer systems and network by deploying state-of the-\nart security technologies may thereafter be at more risk from attackers\nwho use social engineering strategies, methods, and tactics to accomplish\ntheir objectives.\nThis chapter presents specific policies designed to minimize a company’s\nrisk with respect to social engineering attacks. The policies address\nattacks that are based not strictly on exploiting technical vulnerabilities.\nThey involve using some kind of pretext or ruse to deceive a trusted\nemployee into providing information or performing an action that gives\nthe perpetrator access to sensitive business information or to enterprise\ncomputer systems and networks.\nWHAT IS A SECURITY POLICY?\nSecurity policies are clear instructions that provide the guidelines for\nemployee behavior for safeguarding information, and are a fundamental\nbuilding block in developing effective controls to counter potential\nsecurity threats. These policies are even more significant when it comes to\npreventing and detecting social engineering attacks.\nEffective security controls are implemented by training employees with\nwell-documented policies and procedures. However, it is important to\nnote that security policies, even if religiously followed by all employees,\nare not guaranteed to prevent every social engineering attack. Rather, the\nreasonable goal is always to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level.\nThe policies presented here include measures that, while not strictly\nfocused on social engineering issues, nonetheless belong here because\nthey deal with techniques commonly used in social engineering attacks.\nFor example, policies about opening email attachments--which could\ninstall malicious Trojan Horse software allowing the attacker to take over\nthe victim’s computer--address a method frequently used by computer\nintruders.\nSteps to Developing a Program\nA comprehensive information security program usually starts with a risk\nassessment aimed at determining:\nWhat enterprise information assets need to be protected?\nWhat specific threats exist against these assets?\nWhat damage would be caused to the enterprise if these potential threats\nwere to materialize?\nThe primary goal of risk assessment is to prioritize which information\nassets are in need of immediate safeguards, and whether instituting\nsafeguards will be cost-effective based on a cost-benefit analysis. Simply\nput, what assets are going to be protected first, and how much money\nshould be spent to protect these assets?\nIt’s essential that senior management buy into and strongly support the\nnecessity of developing security policies and an information security\nprogram. As with any other corporate program, if a security program is to\nsucceed, management must do more than merely provide an endorsement,\nit must demonstrate a commitment by personal example. Employees need\nto be aware that management strongly subscribes to the belief that\ninformation security is vital to the company’s operation, that protection of\ncompany business information is essential for the company to remain in\nbusiness, and that every employee’s job may depend on the success of the\nprogram.\nThe person assigned to draft information security policies needs to\nunderstand that the policies should be written in a style free of technical\njargon and readily understood by the non-technical employee. It’s also\nimportant that the document make clear why each policy is important;\notherwise employees may disregard some policies as a waste of time. The\npolicy writer should create a document that presents the policies, and a\nseparate document for procedures, because policies will probably change\nmuch less frequently than the specific procedures used to implement\nthem.\nIn addition, the policy writer should be aware of ways in which security\ntechnologies can be used to enforce good information security practices.\nFor example, most operating systems make it possible to require that user\npasswords conform to certain specifications such as length. In some\ncompanies, a policy prohibiting users from downloading programs can be\ncontrolled via local or global policy settings within the operating system.\nThe policies should require use of security technology whenever cost-\neffective to remove human-based decision-making.\nEmployees must be advised of the consequences for failing to comply\nwith security policies and procedures. A set of appropriate consequences\nfor violating the policies should be developed and widely publicized.\nAlso, a reward program should be created for employees who demonstrate\ngood security practices or who recognize and report a security incident.\nWhenever an employee is rewarded for foiling a security breach, it should\nbe widely publicized throughout the company, for example in an article in\nthe company newsletter.\nOne goal of a security awareness program is to communicate the\nimportance of security policies and the harm that can result from failure to\nfollow such rules. Given human nature, employees will, at times, ignore\nor circumvent policies that appear unjustified or too time-consuming. It is\na management responsibility to insure that employees understand the\nimportance of the policies and are motivated to comply, rather than\ntreating them as obstacles to be circumvented.\nIt’s important to note that information security policies cannot be written\nin stone. As business needs change, as new security technologies come to\nmarket, and as security vulnerabilities evolve, the policies need to be\nmodified or supplemented. A process for regular review and updating\nshould be put into place. Make the corporate security policies and\nprocedures available via the corporate intranet or maintain such policies in\na publicly available folder. This increases the likelihood that such policies\nand procedures will be reviewed more frequently, and provides a\nconvenient method for employees to quickly find the answer to any\ninformation-security related question.\nFinally, periodic penetration tests and vulnerability assessments using\nsocial engineering methods and tactics should be conducted to expose any\nweakness in training or lack of adherence to company policies and\nprocedures. Prior to using any deceptive penetration-testing tactics,\nemployees should be put on notice that such testing may occur from time\nto time.\nHow to Use These Policies\nThe detailed policies presented in this chapter represent only a subset of\nthe information security policies I believe are necessary to mitigate all\nsecurity risks. Accordingly, the policies included here should not be\nconsidered as a comprehensive list of information security policies.\nRather, they are the basis for building a comprehensive body of security\npolicies appropriate to the specific needs of your company.\nPolicy writers for an organization will have to choose the policies that are\nappropriate based on their company’s unique environment and business\ngoals. Each organization, having different security requirements based on\nbusiness needs, legal requirements, organizational culture, and the\ninformation systems used by the company, will take what it needs from\nthe policies presented, and omit the rest.\nThere are also choices to be made about how stringent policies will be in\neach category. A smaller company located in a single facility where most\nemployees know one another does not need to be much concerned about\nan attacker calling on the phone and pretending to be an employee\n(although of course an imposter may masquerade as a vendor). Also,\ndespite the increased risks, a company framed around a casual, relaxed\ncorporate culture may wish to adopt only a limited subset of\nrecommended policies to meet its security objectives.\n\nDATA CLASSIFICATION\nA data classification policy is fundamental to protecting an organization’s\ninformation assets, and sets up categories for governing the release of\nsensitive information. This policy provides a framework for protecting\ncorporate information by making all employees aware of the level of\nsensitivity of each piece of information.\nOperating without a data classification policy--the status quo in almost\nall companies today--leaves most of these decisions in the hands of\nindividual workers. Naturally, employee decisions are largely based on\nsubjective factors, rather than on the sensitivity, criticality, and value of\ninformation. Information is also released because employees are ignorant\nof the possibility that in responding to a request for the information, they\nmay be putting it into the hands of an attacker.\nThe data classification policy sets forth guidelines for classifying valuable\ninformation into one of several levels. With each item assigned a\nclassification, employees can follow a set of data-handling procedures that\nprotect the company from inadvertent or careless release of sensitive\ninformation. These procedures mitigate the possibility that employees will\nbe duped into revealing sensitive information to unauthorized persons.\nEvery employee must be trained on the corporate data classification\npolicy, including those who do not typically use computers or corporate\ncommunications systems. Because every member of the corporate\nworkforce--including the cleaning crew, building guards, and copy-room\nstaff, as well as consultants, contractors, and even interns--may have\naccess to sensitive information, anyone could be the target of an attack.\nManagement must assign an Information Owner to be responsible for any\ninformation that is currently in use at the company. Among other things,\nthe Information Owner is responsible for the protection of the information\nassets. Ordinarily, the Owner decides what level of classification to assign\nbased on the need to protect the information, periodically\nreassesses the classification level assigned, and decides if any changes are\nneeded. The Information Owner may also delegate the responsibility of\nprotecting the data to a Custodian or Designee.\nClassification Categories. and Definitions\nInformation should be separated into varying levels of classification based\non its sensitivity. Once a particular classification system is set up, it’s an\nexpensive and time-consuming process to reclassify information into new\ncategories. In our example policy I chose four classification levels, which\nis appropriate for most medium-to-large businesses. Depending on the\nnumber and types of sensitive information, business may choose to add\nmore categories to further control specific types of information. In smaller\nbusinesses, a three-level classification scheme may be sufficient.\nRemember--the more complex the classification scheme, the more\nexpense to the organization in training employees and enforcing the\nsystem.\nConfidential. This category of information is the most sensitive.\nConfidential information is intended for use only within the organization.\nIn most cases, it should only be shared with a very limited number of\npeople with an absolute need to know. The nature of Confidential\ninformation is such that any unauthorized disclosure could seriously\nimpact the company, its shareholders, its business partners, and/or its\ncustomers. Items of Confidential information generally fall into one of\nthese categories:\nInformation concerning trade secrets, proprietary source code, technical or\nfunctional specifications, or product information that could be of\nadvantage to a competitor.\nMarketing and financial information not available to the public.\nAny other information that is vital to the operation of the company such\nas future business strategies.\nPrivate. This category covers information of a personal nature that is\nintended for use only within the organization. Any unauthorized\ndisclosure of Private information could seriously impact employees, or the\ncompany if obtained by any unauthorized persons (especially social\nengineers). Items of Private information would include employee medical\nhistory, health benefits, bank account information, salary history, or any\nother personal identifying information that is not of public record.\n\nNOTE\nThe Internal category of information is often termed Sensitive by security\npersonnel. I have to use Internal because the term itself explains the\nintented audience. I have used the term Sensitive not as a security\nclassification but as a convenient method of referring to Confidential,\nPrivate, and Internal information; put another way, Sensitive refers to any\ncompany information that is not specifically designated as Public.\nInternal. This category of information can be freely provided to any\npersons employed by the organization. Ordinarily, unauthorized\ndisclosure of Internal information is not expected to cause serious harm to\nthe company, its shareholders, its business partners, its customers, or its\nemployees. However, persons adept in social engineering skills can use\nthis information to masquerade as an authorized employee, contractor, or\nvendor to deceive unsuspecting personnel into providing more sensitive\ninformation that would result in unauthorized access to corporate\ncomputer systems.\nA confidentiality agreement must be signed before Internal information\nmay be disclosed to third parties, such as employees of vendor firms,\ncontractor labor, partner firms, and so on. Internal information generally\nincludes anything used in the course of daily business activity that should\nnot be released to outsiders, such as corporate organizational charts,\nnetwork dial-up numbers, internal system names, remote access\nprocedures, cost center codes, and so on.\nPublic. Information that is specifically designated for release to the\npublic. This type of information can be freely distributed to anyone, such\nas press releases, customer-support contact information, or product\nbrochures. Note that any information not specifically designated as Public\nshould be treated as Sensitive information.\nClassified Data Terminology\nBased on its classification, data should be distributed to certain categories\nof people. A number of policies in this chapter refer to information being\ngiven to an Unverified Person. For the purposes of these policies, an\nUnverified Person is someone whom the employee does not personally\nknow to be an active employee or to b an employee with the proper rank\nto have access to information, or who has not been vouched for by a\ntrusted third party.\nFor the purposes of these policies, a Trusted Person is a person you have\nmet face-to-face who is known to you as a company employee, customer,\nor consultant to the company with the proper rank to have access to\ninformation. A Trusted Person might also be an employee of a company\nhaving an established relationship, with your company (for example, a\ncustomer, vendor, or strategic business partner that has signed a\nnondisclosure agreement).\nIn third party vouching, a Trusted Person provides verification of a\nperson’s employment or status, and the person’s authority to request\ninformation or an action. Note that in some instances, these policies\nrequire you to verify that the Trusted Person is still employed by the\ncompany before responding to a request for information or action by\nsomeone for whom they have vouched.\nA privileged account is a computer or other account requiring access\npermission beyond the basic user account, such as a systems administrator\naccount. Employees with privileged accounts typically have the ability to\nmodify user privileges or perform system functions.\nA general departmental mailbox is a voice mailbox answered with a\ngeneric message for the department. Such a mailbox is used in order to\nprotect names and phone extensions of employees who work in a\nparticular department.",
    "question": "What are the key considerations in developing and implementing effective corporate information security policies to prevent social engineering attacks?",
    "summary": "Many large corporations and government agencies do not publicly report computer security incidents due to concerns about customer confidence and avoiding further attacks. Social engineering attacks are often unnoticed and unreported, but effective policies and employee training can help mitigate these risks. This chapter provides specific policies to address social engineering threats, emphasizing the importance of clear guidelines, regular updates, and training to ensure employees understand and follow security measures."

    "text": "VERIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES\nInformation thieves commonly use deceptive tactics to access or obtain\nconfidential business information by masquerading as legitimate\nemployees, contractors, vendors, or business partners. To maintain\neffective information security, an employee receiving a request to perform\nan action or provide sensitive information must positively identify the\ncaller and verify his authority prior to granting a request.\nThe recommended procedures given in this chapter are designed to help\nan employee who receives a request via any communication method such\nas telephone, email, or fax to determine whether the request and the\nperson making it are legitimate.\nRequests from a Trusted Person\nA request for information or action from a Trusted Person may require:\nVerification that the company actively employs or has a relationship with\nthe person where such a relationship is a condition of access to this\ncategory of information. This is to prevent terminated employees,\nvendors, contractors, and others who no longer are associated with the\ncompany from masquerading as active personnel.\nVerification that the person has a need to know, and is authorized to have\naccess to the information or to request the action.\nRequests from an Unverified Person\nWhen a request is made by an Unverified Person, a reasonable\nverification process must be deployed to positively identify the person\nmaking the request as authorized to receive the requested information,\nespecially when the request in any way involves computers or computer-\nrelated equipment. This process is the fundamental control to prevent\nsuccessful social engineering attacks: If these verification procedures are\nfollowed, they will dramatically reduce successful social engineering\nattacks.\nIt is important that you not make the process so cumbersome that it is\ncost-prohibitive, or that employees ignore it.\nAs detailed below, the verification process involves three steps:\nVerifying that the person is who he or she claims to be.\nDetermining that the requester is currently employed or shares a need-to-\nknow relationship with the company.\nDetermining that the person is authorized to receive the specific\ninformation or to call for the requested action.\nStep One: Verification of Identity\nThe recommended steps for verification are listed below in order of\neffectiveness--the higher the number, the more effective the method. Also\nincluded with each item is a statemen.t about the weakness of that\nparticular method, and the way in which a social engineer can defeat or\ncircumvent the method to deceive an employee.\n1. Caller ID (assuming this feature is included in the company\ntelephone system). From the caller ID display, ascertain\nwhether the call is from inside or outside the company, and\nthat the name or telephone number displayed matches the\nidentity provided by the caller.\nWeakness: External caller ID information can be falsified by anyone with\naccess to a PBX or telephone switch connected to digital phone service.\n2. Callback. Look up the requester in the company directory,\nand call back to the listed extension to verify that the\nrequester is an employee.\nWeakness: An attacker with sufficient knowledge can call-forward a\ncompany extension so that, when the employee places the verification call\nto the listed phone number, the call is transferred to the attacker’s outside\nphone number.\n3. Vouching. A Trusted Person who vouches for the requester’s\nidentity verifies the requester.\nWeakness: Attackers using a pretext are frequently able to convince\nanother employee of their identity, and get that employee to vouch for\nthem.\n4. Shared Secret. Use an enterprise-wide shared secret, such as a\npassword or daily code.\nWeakness.\" If many people know the shared secret, it may be easy for an\nattacker to learn it.\n5. Employee’s Supervisor/Manager. Telephone the employee’s\nimmediate supervisor and request verification.\nWeakness: If the requester has provided the telephone number for\nreaching his or her manager, the person the employee reaches when\ncalling the number may not be the real manager but may, in fact, be an\naccomplice of the attacker.\n6. Secure Email. Request a digitally signed message.\nWeakness: If an attacker has already compromised an employee’s\ncomputer and installed a keystroke logger to obtain the employee’s pass\nphrase, he can send digitally signed email that appears to be from the\nemployee.\n7. Personal Voice Recognition. The person receiving the\nrequest has dealt with the requester (preferably face-to-face),\nknows for certain that the person actually is a Trusted Person,\nand is familiar enough with the person to recognize his or her\nvoice on the telephone.\nWeakness: This is a fairly secure method, not easily circumvented by an\nattacker, but is of no use if the person receiving the request has never met\nor spoken with the requester.\n8. Dynamic Password Solution. The requester authenticates himself or\nherself through the use of a dynamic password solution such as a\nSecure ID.\nWeakness: To defeat this method, an attacker would have to obtain one of\nthe dynamic password devices, as well the accompanying PIN of the\nemployee to whom the device rightfully belongs, or would have to\ndeceive an employee into reading the information on the display of the\ndevice and\nproviding the PIN.\n9. In Person with ID. The requester appears in person and\npresents an employee badge or other suitable identification,\npreferably a picture ID.\nWeakness: Attackers are often able to steal an employee badge, or create\na phony badge that appears authentic; however, attackers generally shun\nthis approach because appearing in person puts the attacker at significant\nrisk of being identified and apprehended.\nStep Two: Verification of Employment Status\nThe greatest information security threat is not from the professional social\nengineer, nor from the skilled computer intruder, but from someone much\ncloser: the just-fired employee seeking revenge or hoping to set himself\nup in business using information stolen from the company. (Note that a\nversion of this procedure can also be used to verify that someone still\nenjoys another kind of business relationship with your company, such as a\nvendor, consultant, or contract worker.)\nBefore providing Sensitive information to another person or accepting\ninstructions for actions involving the computer or computer-related\nequipment, verify that the requester is still a current employee by using\none of these methods:\nEmployee Directory Check. If the company maintains an online\nemployee directory that accurately reflects active employees, verify that\nthe requester is still listed.\nRequester’s Manager Verification. Call the requester’s manager using a\nphone number listed in the company directory, not a number provided by\nthe requester.\nRequester’s Department or Workgroup Verification. Call the requester’s\ndepartment or workgroup and determine from anyone in that department\nor workgroup that the requester is still employed by the company.\nStep Three: Verification of Need to Know\nBeyond verifying that the requester is a current employee or has a\nrelationship with your company, there still remains the issue of whether\nthe requester is authorized to have access to the information being\nrequested, or is authorized to request that specific actions affecting\ncomputers or computer-related equipment be taken.\nThis determination may be made by using one of these methods:\nConsult job title/workgroup/responsibilities lists. A company can provide\nready access to authorization information by publishing lists of which\nemployees are entitled to what information. These lists may be organized\nin terms of employee job title, employee departments and workgroups,\nemployee responsibilities, or by some combination of these. Such lists\nwould need to be maintained on line to be kept current and provide quick\naccess to authorization information. Ordinarily, Information Owners\nwould be responsible for overseeing the creation and maintenance of the\nlists for access to information under the Owner’s control.\n\nNOTE\nIt is important to note that maintaining such lists is an invitation to the\nsocial engineer. Consider: If an attacker targets a company becomes\naware that the company maintains such lists, there is a strong motivation\nto obtain one. Once in hand, such a list opens many doors to the attacker\nand puts the company at serious risk.\nObtain Authority from a Manager. An employee contacts his or her own\nmanager, or the manager of the requester, for authority to comply with the\nrequest.\nObtain Authority from the Information Owner or a Designee. The\ninformation Owner is the ultimate judge of whether a particular person\nshould be granted access. The process for computer-based access control\nis for the employee to contact his or her immediate manager to approve a\nrequest for access to information based on existing job profiles. If such a\nprofile does not exist, it is the manager’s responsibility to contact the\nrelevant data Owner for permission. This chain of command should be\nfollowed so that Information Owners are not barraged with requests when\nthere is a frequent need to know.\nObtain Authority by Means of a Proprietary Software Package. For a large\ncompany in a highly competitive industry, it may be practical to develop a\nproprietary software package that provides need-to-know authorization.\nSuch a database stores employee names and access privileges to classified\ninformation. Users would not be able to look up each individual’s access\nrights, but instead would enter the requester’s name, and the identifier\nassociated with the information being sought. The software then provides\na response indicating whether or not the employee is authorized to access\nsuch information. This alternative avoids the danger of creating a list of\npersonnel with respective access rights to valuable, critical, or sensitive\ninformation that could be stolen.",
    "question": "What are the three key steps an employee should follow to verify the legitimacy of a request for sensitive information?",
    "summary": "The text outlines verification and authorization steps to prevent information theft by impersonators. Employees must confirm the identity and authority of anyone requesting sensitive information. The process involves three main steps: verifying the person's identity, checking their employment status, and ensuring they have a need to know the information. Each step includes methods to confirm legitimacy, with potential weaknesses noted. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining secure authorization lists to avoid being exploited by social engineers."

    "text": "MANAGEMENT POLICIES\nThe following policies pertain to management-level employees. These are\ndivided into the areas of Data Classification, Information Disclosure,\nPhone Administration, and Miscellaneous Policies. Note that each\ncategory of policies uses a unique numbering structure for easy\nidentification of individual policies. Data Classification Policies\nData Classification refers to how your company classifies the sensitivity\nof information and who should have access to that information. 1-1 Assign data classification\nPolicy: All valuable, sensitive, or critical business information must be\nassigned to a classification category by the designated Information Owner\nor delegate. Explanation/Notes: The designated Owner or delegate will assign the\nappropriate data classification to any information routinely used to\naccomplish business goals. The Owner also controls who can access such\ninformation and what use can be made of it. The Owner of the\ninformation may reassign the classification and may designate a time\nperiod for automatic declassification. Any item not otherwise marked should be classified as Sensitive. 1-2 Publish classified handling procedures\nPolicy: The company must establish procedures governing the release of\ninformation in each category. Explanation/Notes.\" Once classifications are established, procedures for\nrelease of information to employees and to outsiders must be set up, as\ndetailed in the Verification and Authorization Procedures outlined earlier\nin this chapter. 1-3 Label all items\nPolicy.\" Clearly mark both printed materials and media storage containing\nConfidential, Private, or Internal information to show the appropriate data\nclassification. Explanation/Notes.\" Hard copy documents must have a cover sheet, with\na classification label prominently displayed, and a classification label on\nevery page that is visible when the document is open. All electronic files that cannot easily be labeled with appropriate data\nclassifications (database or raw data files) must be protected via access\ncontrols to insure that such information is not improperly disclosed, and\nthat it cannot be changed, destroyed, or made inaccessible. All computer media such as floppy disks, tapes, and CD-ROMs must be\nlabeled with the highest classification of any information contained\ntherein. Information Disclosure\nInformation disclosure involves the release of information to various\nparties based on their identity and need to know. 2-1 Employee verification procedure\nPolicy: The company should establish comprehensive procedures to be\nused by employees for verifying the identity, employment status, and\nauthorization of an individual before releasing Confidential or Sensitive\ninformation or performing any task that involves use of any computer\nhardware or software. Explanation/Notes: Where justified by size of company and security\nneeds, advanced security technologies should be used to authenticate\nidentity. The best security practice would be to deploy authentication\ntokens in combination with a shared secret to positively identify persons\nmaking requests. While this practice would substantially minimize risk,\nthe cost may be prohibitive for some businesses. In those circumstances,\nthe company should use a company-wide shared secret, such as a daily\npassword or code. 2-2 Release of information to third parties\nPolicy: A set of recommended information disclosure procedures must\nbe made available and all employees should be trained to follow them. Explanation/Notes: Generally, distribution procedures need to be\nestablished for:\nInformation made available within the company. Distribution of information to individuals and employees of organizations\nhaving an established relationship with the company, such as consultants,\ntemporary workers, interns, employees of organizations that have a\nvendor relationship or strategic partnership arrangement with the\ncompany, and so on. Information made available outside the company. Information at each classification level, when the information is being\ndelivered in person, by telephone, by email, by facsimile, by voice mail,\nby postal service, by signature delivery service, and by electronic transfer. 2-3 Distribution of Confidential information\nPolicy: Confidential information, which is company information that\ncould cause substantial harm if obtained by unauthorized persons, may be\ndelivered only to a Trusted Person who is authorized to receive it. Explanation/Notes: Confidential information in a physical form (that is,\nprinted copy or on a removable storage medium) may be delivered:\nIn person. By internal mail, sealed and marked with the Confidential classification. Outside the company by a reputable delivery service (that is, FedEx, UPS,\nand so on) with signature of recipient required, or by a postal service\nusing a certified or registered class of mail. Confidential information in electronic form (computer files, database\nfiles, email) may be delivered:\nWithin the body of encrypted email. By email attachment, as an encrypted file. By electronic transfer to a server within the company internal network. By a fax program from a computer, provided that only the intended\nrecipient uses the destination machine, or that the intended recipient is\nwaiting at the destination machine while the fax is being sent. As an\nalternative, facsimiles can be sent without the recipient present if sent\nover an encrypted telephone link to a password-protected fax server. Confidential information may be discussed in person; by telephone within\nthe company; by telephone outside the company if encrypted; by\nencrypted satellite transmission; by encrypted videoconferencing link; and\nby encrypted Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP). For transmission by fax machine, the recommended method calls for the\nsender to transmit a cover page; the recipient, on receiving the page,\ntransmits a page in response, demonstrating that he/she is at the fax\nmachine. The sender then transmits the fax. The following means of communication are not acceptable for discussing\nor distributing Confidential information: unencrypted email, voice mail\nmessage, regular mail, or any wireless communication method (cellular,\nShort Message Service, or cordless). 2-4 Distribution of Private information\nPolicy: Private information, which is personal information about an\nemployee or employees that, if disclosed, could be used to harm\nemployees or the company, may be delivered only to a Trusted Person\nwho is authorized to receive it. Explanation/Notes: Private information in a physical form (that is, hard-\ncopy or data on a removable storage medium) may be delivered:\nIn person\nBy internal mail, sealed and marked with the Private classification\nBy regular mail\nPrivate information in electronic form (computer files, database files,\nemail) may be delivered:\nBy internal email. By electronic transfer to a server within the company internal network. By facsimile, provided that only the intended recipient uses the\ndestination machine, or that the intended recipient is waiting at the\ndestination machine while the fax is being sent. Facsimiles can also be\nsent to password-protected fax servers. As an alternative, facsimiles can\nbe sent without the recipient present if sent over an encrypted telephone\nlink to a password-protected fax server. Private information may be discussed in person; by telephone; by satellite\ntransmission; by videoconferencing link; and by encrypted Vole\nThe following means of communication are not acceptable for discussing\nor distributing Private information: unencrypted email, voice mail\nmessage, regular mail, and by any wireless communication method\n(cellular, SMS, or cordless). 2-5 Distribution of Internal information\nPolicy: Internal information is information to be shared only within the\ncompany or with other Trusted persons who have signed a nondisclosure\nagreement. You must establish guidelines for the distribution of Internal\ninformation. Explanation/Notes: Internal information may be distributed in any form,\nincluding internal email, but may not be distributed outside the company\nin email form unless encrypted. 2-6 Discussing Sensitive information over the telephone\nPolicy: Prior to releasing any information that is not designated as Public\nover the telephone, the person releasing such information must personally\nrecognize the requester’s voice through prior business contact, or the\ncompany phone system must identify the call as being from an internal\ntelephone number that has been assigned to the requester. Explanation/Notes: If the requester’s voice is not known, call the\nrequester’s internal phone number to verify the requester voice through a\nrecorded voice mail message, or have the requester’s manager verify the\nrequester’s identity and need to know. 2-7 Lobby or reception personnel procedures\nPolicy: Lobby personnel must obtain photo identification prior to\nreleasing any package to any person who is not known to be an active\nemployee. A log should be kept for recording the person’s name, driver’s\nlicense number, birth date, the item picked up, and the date and time of\nsuch pickup. Explanation/Notes: This policy also applies to handing over outgoing\npackages to any messenger or courier service such as FedEx, UPS, or\nAirborne Express. These companies issue identification cards that can be\nused to verify employee identity. 2-8 Transfer of software to third parties\nPolicy: Prior to the transfer or disclosure of any software, program, or\ncomputer instructions, the requester’s identity must be positively verified,\nand it must be established whether such release is consistent with the data\nclassification assigned to such information. Ordinarily, software\ndeveloped in-house in source-code format is considered highly\nproprietary, and classified Confidential. Explanation/Notes: Determination of authorization is usually based on\nwhether the requester needs access to the software to do his or her job. 2-9 Sales and marketing qualification of customer leads\nPolicy: Sales and marketing personnel must qualify leads before releasing\ninternal callback numbers, product plans, product group contacts, or other\nSensitive information to any potential customer. Explanation/Notes: It is a common tactic for industrial spies to contact a\nsales and marketing representative and make him believe that a big\npurchase may be in the offing. In an effort to take advantage of the sales\nopportunity, sales and marketing reps often release information that can\nbe used by the attacker as a poker chip to obtain access to Sensitive\ninformation. 2-10 Transfer of files or data\nPolicy: Files or other electronic data should not be transferred to any\nremovable media unless the requester is a Trusted Person whose identity\nhas been verified and who has a need to have such data in that format. Explanation/Notes: A social engineer can easily dupe an employee by\nproviding a plausible request for having Sensitive information copied to a\ntape, Zip disc, or other removable media, and sent to him or held in the\nlobby for pickup. Phone Administration\nPhone administration policies ensure that employees can verify caller\nidentity, and protect their own contact information from those calling into\nthe company. 3-1 Call forwarding on dial-up or fax numbers\nPolicy: Call forwarding services that permit forwarding calls to external\ntelephone numbers will not be placed on any dial-up modem or fax\ntelephone numbers within the company. Explanation/Notes: Sophisticated attackers may attempt to dupe telephone\ncompany personnel or internal telecom workers into forwarding internal\nnumbers to an external phone line under control of an attacker. This attack\nallows the intruder to intercept faxes, request Confidential information to\nbe faxed within the company (personnel assume that faxing within the\norganization must be safe) or dupe dial-in users into\nproviding their account passwords by forwarding the dial-up lines to a\ndecoy computer that simulates the login process. Depending on the telephone service used within the company, the call\nforwarding feature may be under control of the communications provider,\nrather than the telecommunications department. In such circumstances, a\nrequest will be made to the communications provider to insure the call\nforwarding feature is not present on the telephone numbers assigned to\ndial-up and fax lines. 3-2 Caller ID\nPolicy: The corporate telephone system must provide caller line\nidentification (caller ID) on all internal telephone sets, and, if possible,\nenable distinctive ringing to indicate when a call is from outside the\ncompany. Explanation/Notes: If employees can verify the identity of telephone calls\nfrom outside the company it may help them prevent an attack, or identify\nthe attacker to appropriate security personnel. 3-3 Courtesy phones\nPolicy: To prevent visitors from masquerading as company workers,\nevery courtesy telephone will clearly indicate the location of the caller\n(for example, \"Lobby\") on the recipient’s caller ID. Explanation/Notes.\" If the caller ID for internal calls shows extension\nnumber only, appropriate provision must be made for calls placed from\ncompany phones in the reception area and any other public areas. It must\nnot be possible for an attacker to place a call from one of these phones\nand\ndeceive an employee into believing that the call has been placed\ninternally from an employee telephone. 3-4 Manufacturer default passwords shipped with phone systems\nPolicy: The voice mail administrator should change all default passwords\nthat were shipped with the phone system prior to use by company\npersonnel. Explanation/Notes: Social engineers can obtain lists of default passwords\nfrom manufacturers and use these to access administrator accounts. 3-5 Department voice mailboxes\nPolicy.\" Set up a generic voice mailbox for every department that\nordinarily has contact with the public. Explanation/Notes: The first step of social engineering involves gathering\ninformation about the target company and its personnel. By limiting the\naccessibility of the names and telephone numbers of employees, a\ncompany makes it more difficult for the social engineer to identify targets\nin the company, or names of legitimate employees for use in deceiving\nother personnel. 3-6 Verification of telephone system vendor\nPolicy: No vendor-support technicians will be permitted to remotely\naccess the company telephone system without positive identification of\nvendor and authorization to perform such work. Explanation/Notes: Computer intruders who gain access to corporate\ntelephone systems gain the ability to create voice mailboxes, intercept\nmessages intended for other users, or make free phone calls at the\ncorporation’s expense. 3-7 Configuration of phone system\nPolicy.\" The voice mail administrator will enforce security requirements\nby configuring the appropriate security parameters in the telephone\nsystem. Explanation/Notes: Phone systems can be set up with greater or lesser\ndegrees of security for voice mail messages. The administrator should be\naware of company security concerns, and work with security personnel to\nconfigure the phone system to protect Sensitive data. 3-8 Call trace feature\nPolicy: Depending on limitations of the communications provider, the\ncall trace feature will be enabled globally to allow employees to activate\nthe trap-and-trace feature when the caller is suspected of being an\nattacker. Explanation/Notes: Employees must be trained on call trace usage and\nthe appropriate circumstances when it should be used.\n\nA call trace should\nbe initiated when the caller is clearly attempting to gain unauthorized\naccess to corporate computer systems or requesting Sensitive information. Whenever an employee activates the call trace feature, immediate\nnotification must be sent to the Incident Reporting Group. 3-9 Automated phone systems\nPolicy.\" If the company uses an automated phone answering system, the\nsystem must be programmed so that telephone extensions are not\nannounced when transferring a call to an employee or department. Explanation/Notes: Attackers can use a company’s automated telephone\nsystem to map employee names to telephone extensions. Attackers can\nthen use knowledge of those extensions to convince call recipients that\nthey are employees with a right to insider information. 3-10 Voice mailboxes to become disabled after successive invalid access\nattempts\nPolicy: Program the corporate telephone system to lock out any voice\nmail account whenever a specified number of successive invalid access\nattempts have been made. Explanation/Notes.\" The Telecommunications administrator must lock out\na voice mailbox after five successive invalid attempts to log in. The\nadministrator must then reset any voice mail lockouts manually. 3-11 Restricted telephone extensions\nPolicy.\" All internal telephone extensions to departments or workgroups\nthat ordinarily do not receive calls from external callers (help desk,\ncomputer room, employee technical support, and so on) should be\nprogrammed so that these telephones can be reached only from internal\nextensions. Alternately, they can be password-protected so that employees\nand other authorized persons calling from the outside must enter the\ncorrect password. Explanation/Notes: While use of this policy will block most attempts by\namateur social engineers to reach their likely targets, it should be noted\nthat a determined attacker will sometimes be able to talk an employee into\ncalling the restricted extension and asking the person who answers the\nphone to call the attacker, or simply conference in the restricted extension. During security training, this method of tricking employees into assisting\nthe intruder should be discussed to raise employee awareness about these\ntactics. Miscellaneous\n4-1 Employee badge design\nPolicy: Employee badges must be designed to include a large photo that\ncan be recognized from a distance. Explanation/Notes: The photograph on corporate ID badges of standard\ndesign is, for security purposes, only slightly better than worthless. The\ndistance between a person entering the building and the guard or\nreceptionist who has the responsibility to check identification is usually\ngreat enough that the picture is too small to recognize when the person\nwalks by. For the photo to be of value in this situation, a redesign of the\nbadge is necessary. 4-2 Access rights review when changing position or responsibilities\nPolicy: Whenever a company employee changes positions or is given\nincreased or decreased job responsibilities, the employee’s manager will\nnotify IT of the change in the employee’s responsibilities so that the\nappropriate security profile can be assigned. Explanation/Notes: Managing the access rights of personnel is necessary\nto limit disclosure of protected information. The rule of least privilege\nwill apply: The access rights assigned to users will be the minimum\nnecessary to perform their jobs. Any requests for changes that result in\nelevated access rights must be in accordance with a policy on granting\nelevated access rights. The worker’s manager or the human resources department will have the\nresponsibility of notifying the information technology department to\nproperly adjust the account holder’s access rights as needed. 4-3 Special identification for non employees\nPolicy: Your company should issue a special photo company badge to\ntrusted delivery people and non employees who have a business need to\nenter company premises on a regular basis. Explanation/Notes: Non employees who need to enter the building\nregularly (for example, to make food or beverage deliveries to the\ncafeteria, or to repair copying machines or make telephone installations)\ncan pose a threat to your company. In addition to issuing identification to\nthese visitors, make sure your employees are trained to spot a visitor\nwithout a badge and know how to act in that situation. 4-4 Disabling computer accounts for contractors\nPolicy: Whenever a contractor who has been issued a computer account\nhas completed his or her assignment, or when the contract expires, the\nresponsible manager will immediately notify the information technology\ndepartment to disable the contractor’s computer accounts, including any\naccounts used for database access, dial-up, or Internet access from remote\nlocations. Explanation/Notes: W-hen a worker’s employment is terminated, there is\na danger that he or she will use knowledge of your company’s systems and\nprocedures to gain access to data. All computer accounts used by or\nknown to the worker must be promptly disabled. This includes accounts\nthat provide access to production databases, remote dial-in accounts, and\nany accounts used to access computer-related devices. 4-5 Incident reporting organization\nPolicy: An incident reporting organization must be established or, in\nsmaller companies, an incident reporting individual and backup person\ndesignated, for receiving and distributing alerts concerning possible\nsecurity incidents in progress. Explanation/Notes: By centralizing the reporting of suspected security\nincidents, an attack that may otherwise have gone unnoticed can be\ndetected. In the event that systematic attacks across the organization are\ndetected and reported, the incident reporting organization may be able to\ndetermine what the attacker is targeting so that special efforts can be made\nto protect those assets. Employees assigned to receive incident reports must become familiar\nwith social engineering methods and tactics, enabling them to evaluate to\nreports and recognize when an attack may be in progress. 4-6 Incident reporting hotline\nPolicy: A hotline to the incident reporting organization or person, which\nmay consist of an easy-to-remember phone extension, must be\nestablished. Explanation/Notes: When employees suspect that they are the target of a\nsocial engineering attack, they must be able to immediately notify the\nincident reporting organization. In order for the notification to be timely,\nall company telephone operators and receptionists must have the number\nposted or otherwise immediately available to them. A company-wide early warning system can substantially aid the\norganization in detecting and responding to an ongoing attack. Employees\nmust be sufficiently well trained that one who suspects he or she has been\nthe target of a social engineering attack will immediately call the incident\nreporting hotline. In accordance with published procedures, the incident\nreporting personnel will immediately notify the targeted groups that an\nintrusion may be in progress so personnel will be on alert. In order for the\nnotification to be timely, the reporting hotline number must be widely\ndistributed throughout the company. 4-7 Sensitive areas must be secured\nPolicy: A security guard will screen access to sensitive or secure areas and\nshould require two forms of authentication. Explanation/Notes: One acceptable form of authentication uses a digital\nelectronic lock that requires an employee to swipe his employee badge\nand enter an access code. The best method to secure sensitive areas is to\npost a security guard who observes any access-controlled entry. In\norganizations where this is not cost-effective, two forms of authentication\nshould be used to validate identity. Depending on risk and cost, a\nbiometric-enabled access card is recommended. 4-8 Network and phone cabinets\nPolicy: Cabinets, closets, or rooms containing network cabling, phone\nwiring, or network access points must be secured at all times. Explanation/Notes: Only authorized personnel will be permitted\naccess to telephone and network closets, rooms, or cabinets. Any outside\nmaintenance people or vendor personnel must be positively identified\nusing the procedures published by the department responsible for\ninformation security. Access to phone lines, network hubs, switches,\nbridges, or other related equipment could be used by an attacker to\ncompromise computer and network security. 4-9 Intracompany mail bins\nPolicy: Intracompany mail bins must not be located in publicly accessible\nareas. Explanation/Notes: Industrial spies or computer intruders who have\naccess to any intracompany mail pickup points can easily send forged\nauthorization letters or internal forms that authorize personnel to release\nConfidential information or to perform .an action that assists the attacker. Additionally, the attacker can mail a floppy disk or electronic media with\ninstructions to install a software update, or open a file that has embedded\nmacro commands that serve the intruder’s objectives. Naturally, any\nrequest received by intracompany mail is assumed to be authentic by the\nparty who receives it. 4-10 The company bulletin board\nPolicy: Bulletin boards for the benefit of company workers should not be\nposted in locations where the public has access. Explanation/Notes: Many businesses have bulletin boards where private\ncompany or personnel information is posted for anyone to read. Employer\nnotices, employee lists, internal memorandums, employee home contact\nnumbers listed in advertisements, and other, similar information are\nfrequently posted on the board. Bulletin boards may be located near company cafeterias, or in close\nproximity to smoking or break areas where visitors have free access. This\ntype of information should not be made available to visitors or the public. 4-1 1 Computer center entrance\nPolicy: The computer room or data center should be locked at all times\nand personnel must authenticate their identity prior to entering. Explanation/Notes: Corporate security ought to consider deploying an\nelectronic badge or access card reader so all entries can be electronically\nlogged and audited. 4-12 Customer accounts with service providers\nPolicy: Company personnel who place service orders with vendors that\nsupply critical services to the company must set up an account password\nto prevent unauthorized persons from placing orders on behalf of the\ncompany. Explanation/Notes: Utility companies and many other vendors allow\ncustomers to set up a password on request; the company should establish\npasswords with all vendors that provide mission-critical services. This\npolicy is especially critical to telecommunication and Internet services. Any time critical services can be affected, a shared secret is necessary to\nverify that the caller is authorized to place such orders. Note, too,\nidentifiers such as social security number, corporate taxpayer\nidentification number,\nmother’s maiden name, or similar identifiers must not be used. A social\nengineer might, for example, call the telephone company and give orders\nto add features such as call forwarding to dial-in modem lines, or make a\nrequest to the Internet Service Provider to change translation information\nto provide a bogus IP address when users perform a hostname lookup. 4-1 3 Departmental contact person\nPolicy: Your company may institute a program under which each\ndepartment or workgroup assigns an employee the responsibility of acting\nas a point contact so that any personnel can easily verify the identity of\nunknown persons claiming to be from that department. For example, the\nhelp desk may contact the departmental point person to verify the identity\nof an employee who is requesting support. Explanation/Notes: This method of verifying identity reduces the pool of\nemployees who are authorized to vouch for employees within their\ndepartment when such employees request support such as resetting\npasswords or other computer account-related issues. Social engineering attacks are successful in part because technical support\npersonnel are pressed for time and do not properly verify the identity of\nrequesters. Typically support staff cannot personally recognize all\nauthorized personnel because of the number of employees in larger\norganizations. The point-person method of vouching limits the number of\nemployees that technical support staff need to be personally familiar with\nfor verification purposes. 4-14 Customer passwords\nPolicy: Customer service representatives shall not have the ability to\nretrieve customer account passwords. Explanation/Notes: Social engineers frequently call customer service\ndepartments and, under a pretext, attempt to obtain a customer’s\nauthentication information, such as the password or social security\nnumber. With this information, the social engineer can then call another\nservice representative, pretend to be the customer, and obtain information\nor place fraudulent orders. To prevent these attempts from succeeding, customer service software\nmust be designed so that representatives can only type in the\nauthentication information provided by the caller, and receive a response\nfrom the system indicating whether the password is correct or not. 4-1 5 Vulnerability testing\nPolicy: Notification of company use of social engineering tactics to test\nsecurity vulnerabilities is required during security awareness training and\nemployee orientation. Explanation/Notes: Without notification of social engineering-penetration\ntesting, company personnel may suffer embarrassment, anger, or other\nemotional trauma from the use of deceptive tactics used against them by\nother employees or contractors. By placing new hires on notice during the\norientation process that they may be subject to this testing, you prevent\nsuch conflict. 4-16 Display of company Confidential information\nPolicy: Company information not designated for public release shall not\nbe displayed in any publicly accessible areas. Explanation/Notes: In addition to Confidential product or procedure\ninformation, internal contact information such as internal telephone or\nemployee lists, or building rosters that contain a list of management\npersonnel for each department within the company must also be kept out\nof view. 4-17 Security awareness training\nPolicy: All persons employed by the company must complete a security\nawareness training course during employee orientation. Furthermore, each\nemployee must take a security awareness refresher course at periodic\nintervals, not to exceed twelve months, as required by the department\nassigned with security-training responsibility. Explanation/Notes: Many organizations disregard end-user awareness\ntraining altogether. According to the 2001 Global Information Security\nSurvey, only 30 percent of the surveyed organizations spend money on\nawareness training for their user-community. Awareness training is an\nessential requirement to mitigate successful security breaches utilizing\nsocial engineering techniques. 4-18 Security training course for computer access\nPolicy: Personnel must attend and successfully complete a security\ninformation course before being given access to any corporate computer\nsystems. Explanation/Notes: Social engineers frequently target new employees,\nknowing that as a group they are generally the people least likely to be\naware of the company’s security policies and the proper procedures to\ndetermine classification and handling of sensitive information. Training should include an opportunity for employees to ask questions\nabout security policies. After training, the account holder should be\nrequired to sign a document acknowledging their understanding of the\nsecurity policies, and their agreement to abide by the policies.\n\n4-19 Employee badge must be color-coded\nPolicy: Identification badges must be color-coded to indicate whether the\nbadge holder is an employee, contractor, temporary, vendor, consultant,\nvisitor, or intern. Explanation/Notes: The color of the badge is an excellent way to\ndetermine\nthe status of a person from a distance. An alternative would be to use\nlarge lettering to indicate the badge holder’s status, but using a color-\ncoded scheme is unmistakable and easier to see. A common social engineering tactic to gain access to a physical building\nis to dress up as a delivery person or repair technician. Once inside the\nfacility, the attacker will masquerade as another employee or lie about his\nstatus to obtain cooperation from unsuspecting employees. The purpose of\nthis policy is to prevent people from entering the building legitimately and\nthen entering areas they should not have access to. For example, a person\nentering the facility as a telephone repair technician would not be able to\nmasquerade as an employee: The color of the badge would give him\naway.\n\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY POLICIES\nThe information technology department of any company has a special\nneed for policies that help it protect the organizations information assets. To reflect the typical structure of IT operations in an organization, I have\ndivided the IT policies into General, Help Desk, Computer\nAdministration, and Computer Operations. General\n5-1 IT department employee contact information\nPolicy: Phone numbers and email addresses of individual IT department\nemployees should not be disclosed to any person without a need to know. Explanation/Notes: The purpose of this policy is to prevent contact\ninformation from being abused by social engineers. By only disclosing a\ngeneral contact number or email address for IT, outsiders will be blocked\nfrom contacting IT department personnel directly. The email address for\nsite administrative and technical contacts should only consist of generic\nnames such as admin@companyname.com; published telephone numbers\nshould connect to a departmental voice mailbox, not to individual\nworkers. When direct contact information is available, it becomes easy for a\ncomputer intruder to reach specific IT employees and trick them into\nproviding information that can be used in an attack, or to impersonate IT\nemployees by using their names and contact information. 5-2 Technical support requests\nPolicy: All technical support requests must be referred to the group that\nhandles such requests. Explanation/Notes: Social engineers may attempt to target IT personnel\nwho do not ordinarily handle technical support issues, and who may not\nbe aware of the proper security procedures when handling such requests. Accordingly, IT staff must be trained to deny these requests and refer the\ncaller to the group that has the responsibility of providing support. Help Desk\n6-1 Remote access procedures\nPolicy: Help desk personnel must not divulge details or instructions\nregarding remote access, including external network access points or\ndialup numbers, unless the requester has been:\nVerified as authorized to receive Internal information; and,\nVerified as authorized to connect to the corporate network as an external\nuser. Unless known on a person-to-person basis, the requester must be\npositively identified in accordance with the Verification and\nAuthorization Procedures outlined at the beginning of this chapter. Explanation/Notes: The corporate help desk is often a primary target for\nthe social engineer, both because the nature of their work is to assist users\nwith computer-related issues, and because they usually have elevated\nsystem privileges. All help desk personnel must be trained to act as a\nhuman firewall to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information that\nwill assist any unauthorized persons from gaining access to company\nresources. The simple rule is to never disclose remote access procedures\nto anyone until positive verification of identity has been made. 6-2 Resetting passwords\nPolicy: The password to a user account may be reset only at the request of\nthe account holder. Explanation/Notes: The most common ploy used by social engineers is to\nhave another person’s account password reset or changed. The attacker\nposes as the employee using the pretext that their password was lost or\nforgotten. In an effort to reduce the success of this type of attack, an IT\nemployee receiving a request for a password reset must call the employee\nback prior to taking any action; the call back must not be made to a phone\nnumber provided by the requester, but to a number obtained from the\nemployee telephone directory. See Verification and Authorization\nProcedures for more about this procedure. 6-3 Changing access privileges\nPolicy: All requests to increase a user’s privileges or access rights must be\napproved in writing by the account holder’s manager. When the change is\nmade a confirmation must be sent to the requesting manager via\nintracompany mail. Furthermore, such requests must be verified as\nauthentic in accordance with the Verification and Authorization\nProcedures. Explanation/Notes: Once a computer intruder has compromised a standard\nuser account, the next step is to elevate his or her privileges so that the\nattacker has complete control over the compromised system. An attacker\nwho has knowledge of the authorization process can spoof an authorized\nrequest when email, fax, or telephone are used to transmit it. For example,\nthe attacker may phone technical support or the help desk and attempt to\npersuade a technician to grant additional access rights to the compromised\naccount. 6-4 New account authorization\nPolicy: A request to create a new account for an employee, contractor,\nor other authorized person must be made either in writing and signed by\nthe employee’s manager, or sent by digitally signed electronic mail. These\nrequests must also be verified by sending a confirmation of the request\nthrough intracompany mail. Explanation/Notes: Because passwords and other information useful in\nbreaking into computer systems are the highest priority targets of\ninformation thieves for gaining access, special precautions are necessary. The intention of this policy is to prevent computer intruders from\nimpersonating authorized personnel or forging requests for new accounts. Therefore, all such requests must be positively verified using the\nVerification and Authorization Procedures. 6-5 Delivery of new passwords\nPolicy: New passwords must be handled as company Confidential\ninformation, delivered by secure methods including in person; by a\nsignature-required delivery service such as registered mail; or by UPS or\nFedEx. See policies concerning distribution of Confidential information. Explanation/Notes: Intracompany mail may also be used, but it is\nrecommended that passwords be sent in secure envelopes that obscure the\ncontent. A suggested method is to establish a computer point person in\neach department who has the responsibility of handling distribution of\nnew account details and vouching for the identity of personnel who lose\nor forget their passwords. In these circumstances, support personnel\nwould always be working with a smaller group of employees that would\nbe personally recognized. 6-6 Disabling an account\nPolicy: Prior to disabling a user’s account you must require positive\nverification that the request was made by authorized personnel. Explanation/Notes: The intention of this policy is to prevent an attacker\nfrom spoofing a request to disable an account, and then calling to\ntroubleshoot the user’s inability to access the computer system. When the\nsocial engineer calls posing as a technician with pre-existing knowledge\nof the user’s inability to log in, the victim often complies with a request to\nreveal his or her password during the troubleshooting process. 6-7 Disabling network ports or devices\nPolicy: No employee should disable any network device or port for any\nunverified technical support personnel. Explanation/Notes: The intention of this policy is to prevent an attacker\nfrom spoofing a request to disable a network port, and then calling the\nworker to troubleshoot his or her inability to access the network. When the social engineer, posing as a helpful technician, calls with pre-\nexisting knowledge of the user’s network problem, the victim often\ncomplies with a request to reveal his or her password during the\ntroubleshooting process. 6-8 Disclosure of procedures for wireless access\nPolicy: No personnel should disclose procedures for accessing company\nsystems over wireless networks to any parties not authorized to connect to\nthe wireless network. Explanation/Notes: Always obtain prior verification of a requester as a\nperson authorized to connect to the corporate network as an external user\nbefore releasing wireless access information. See Verification and\nAuthorization Procedures. 6-9 User trouble tickets\nPolicy: The names of any employees who have reported computer-related\nproblems should not be revealed outside the information technology\ndepartment. Explanation/Notes: In a typical attack, a social engineer will call the\nhelp desk and request the names of any personnel who have reported\nrecent computer problems. The caller may pretend to be an employee,\nvendor, or an employee of the telephone company. Once he obtains the\nnames of persons reporting trouble, the social engineer, posing as a help\ndesk or technical support person, contacts the employee and says he/she is\ncalling to troubleshoot the problem. During the call, the attacker deceives\nthe victim into providing the desired information or into performing an\naction that facilitates the attacker’s objective. 6-10 Initiating execute commands or running programs\nPolicy: Personnel employed in the IT department who have privileged\naccounts should not execute any commands or run any application\nprograms at the request of any person not personally known to them. Explanation/Notes: A common method attackers use to install a Trojan\nHorse program or other malicious software is to change the name of an\nexisting program, and then call the help desk complaining that an error\nmessage is displayed whenever an attempt is made to run the program. The attacker persuades the help desk technician to run the program\nhimself. When the technician complies, the malicious software inherits\nthe\nprivileges of the user executing the program and performs a task, which\ngives the attacker the same computer privileges as the help desk\nemployee. This may allow the attacker to take control of the company\nsystem. This policy establishes a countermeasure to this tactic by requiring that\nsupport personnel verify employment status prior to running any program\nat the request of a caller. Computer Administration\n7-1 Changing global access rights\nPolicy: A request to change the global access rights associated with an\nelectronic job profile must be approved by the group assigned the\nresponsibility of managing access rights on the corporate network. Explanation/Notes: Authorized personnel will analyze each such request\nto determine whether the change might entail a threat to information\nsecurity. If so, the responsible employee will address the pertinent issues\nwith the requester and jointly arrive at a decision about the changes to be\nmade. 7-2 Remote access requests\nPolicy: Remote computer access will only be provided to personnel who\nhave a demonstrated need to access corporate computer systems from off-\nsite locations. The request must be made by an employee’s manager and\nverified as described in the Verification and Authorization Procedures\nsection. Explanation/Notes: Recognizing the need for off-site access into the\ncorporate network by authorized personnel, limiting such access only to\npeople with a need may dramatically reduce risk and management of\nremote access users. The smaller the number of people with external\ndialup privileges, the smaller the pool of potential targets for an attacker. Never forget that the attacker also may target remote users with the intent\nof hijacking their connection into the corporate network, or by\nmasquerading as them during a pretext call. 7-3 Resetting privileged account passwords\nPolicy: A request to reset a password to a privileged account must be\napproved by the system manager or administrator responsible for the\ncomputer on which the account exists. The new password must be sent\nthrough intracompany mail or delivered in person. Explanation/Notes.\" Privileged accounts have access to all system\nresources and files stored on the computer system. Naturally, these\naccounts deserve the greatest protection possible. 7-4 Outside support personnel remote access\nPolicy: No outside support person (such as software or hardware vendor\npersonnel) may be given any remote access information or be allowed to\naccess any company computer system or related devices without positive\nverification of identity and authorization to perform such services. If the\nvendor requires privileged access to provide support services, the\npassword to the account used by the vendor shall be changed immediately\nafter the vendor services have been completed. Explanation/Notes: Computer attackers may pose as vendors to gain\naccess to corporate computer or telecommunication networks. Therefore,\nit is essential that the identity of the vendor be verified in addition to their\nauthorization to perform any work on the system. Moreover, the doors\ninto the system must be slammed shut once their job is done by changing\nthe account password used by the vendor. No vendor should be allowed to pick his or her own password for any\naccount, even temporarily. Some vendors have been known to use the\nsame or similar passwords across multiple customer systems. For\nexample, one network security company set up privileged accounts on all\ntheir customers’ systems with the same password, and, to add insult to\ninjury, with outside Telnet access enabled. 7-5 Strong authentication for remote access to corporate systems\nPolicy: All connection points into the corporate network from remote\nlocations must be protected through the use of strong authentication\ndevices, such as dynamic passwords or biometrics. Explanation/Notes: Many businesses rely on static passwords as the sole\nmeans of authentication for remote users. This practice is dangerous\nbecause it is insecure: computer intruders target any remote access point\nthat might be the weak link in the victim’s network. Remember that you\nnever know when someone else knows your password. Accordingly, any remote access points must be protected with strong\nauthentication such as time-based tokens, smart cards, or biometric\ndevices, so that intercepted passwords are of no value to an attacker. When authentication based on dynamic passwords is impractical,\ncomputer users must religiously adhere to the policy for choosing hard-to-\nguess passwords. 7-6 Operating system configuration\nPolicy: Systems administrators shall ensure that, wherever possible,\noperating systems are configured so that they are consistent with all\npertinent security policies and procedures. Explanation/Notes: Drafting and distributing security policies is a\nfundamental step toward reducing risk, but in most cases, compliance is\nnecessarily left up to the individual employee. There are, however, any\nnumber of computer-related policies that can be made mandatory through\noperating-system settings, such as the required length of passwords. Automating security policies by configuration of operating system\nparameters effectively takes the decision out of the human element’s\nhands, increasing the overall security of the organization. 7-7 Mandatory expiration\nPolicy: All computer accounts must be set to expire after one year. Explanation/Notes: The intention of this policy is to eliminate the\nexistence of computer accounts that are no longer being used, since\ncomputer intruders commonly target dormant accounts. The process\ninsures that to any computer accounts belonging to former employees or\ncontractors that have been inadvertently left in place are automatically\ndisabled. At management discretion, you may require that employees must take a\nsecurity refresher training course at renewal time, or must review\ninformation security policies and sign an acknowledgment of their\nagreement to adhere to them. 7-8 Generic email addresses\nPolicy: The information technology department shall set up a generic\nemail address for each department within the organization that ordinarily\ncommunicates with the. public. Explanation/Notes: The generic email address can be released to the\npublic by the telephone receptionist or published on the company Web\nsite\n\n.",
    "question": "What are the key policies in place to manage data classification, information disclosure, phone administration, and miscellaneous security practices for management-level employees in a company?",

    "text": "Otherwise, each employee shall only disclose his or her personal\nemail address to people who have genuine need to know. During the first phase of a social engineering attack, the attacker often\ntries to obtain telephone numbers, names, and titles of employees. In most\ncases, this information is publicly available on the company Web site or\njust for the asking. Creation of generic voice mailboxes and/or email\naddresses makes it difficult to associate employee names with particular\ndepartments or responsibilities. 7-9 Contact information for domain registrations\nPolicy: When registering for acquisition of Internet address space or\nhost names, the contact information for administrative, technical, or other\npersonnel should not identify any individual personnel by name. Instead,\nyou should list a generic email address and the main corporate telephone\nnumber. Explanation/Notes: The purpose of this policy is to prevent contact\ninformation from being abused by a computer intruder. When the names\nand phone numbers of individuals are provided, an intruder can use this\ninformation to contact the individuals and attempt to deceive them into\nrevealing system information, or to perform an action item that facilitates\nan attacker’s objective. Or the social engineer can impersonate a listed\nperson in an effort to deceive other company personnel. Instead of an email address to a particular employee, contact information\nmust be in the form of administrator@company.com. Telecommunications department personnel can establish a generic voice\nmailbox for administrative or technical contacts so as to limit information\ndisclosure that would be useful in a social engineering attack. 7-10 Installation of security and operating system updates\nPolicy: All security patches for operating system and application software\nshall be installed as soon as they become available. If this policy conflicts\nwith the operation of mission-critical productions systems, such updates\nshould be performed as soon as practicable. Explanation/Notes: Once a vulnerability has been identified, the\nsoftware manufacturer should be contacted immediately to\ndetermine whether a patch or a temporary fix ha been made\navailable to close the vulnerability. An un-patched computer\nsystem represents one of the greatest security threats to the\nenterprise. When system administrators procrastinate about\napplying the necessary fixes, the window of exposure is open wide\nso that any attacker can climb through. Dozens of security vulnerabilities are identified and published weekly on\nthe Internet. Until information technology staff are vigilant in their efforts\nto apply all security patches and fixes as soon as practical, despite these\nsystems being behind the company firewall, the corporate network will\nalways be at risk of suffering a security incident. It is extremely important\nto keep apprised of published security vulnerabilities identified in the\noperating system or any application programs used during the course of\nbusiness. 7-1 1 Contact information on Web sites\nPolicy: The company’s external Web site shall not reveal any details of\ncorporate structure or identify any employees by name. Explanation/Notes: Corporate structure information such as organization\ncharts, hierarchy charts, employee or departmental lists, reporting\nstructure, names, positions, internal contact numbers, employee numbers,\nor similar information that is used for internal processes should not be\nmade available on publicly accessible Web sites. Computer intruders often obtain very useful information on a target’s Web\nsite. The attacker uses this information to appear as a knowledgeable 206\nemployee when using a pretext or ruse. The social engineer is more likely\nto establish credibility by having this information at his or her disposal. Moreover, the attacker can analyze this information to find out the likely\ntargets who have access to valuable, sensitive, or critical information. 7-12 Creation of privileged accounts\nPolicy.\" No privileged account should be created or system privileges\ngranted to any account unless authorized by the system administrator or\nsystem manager. Explanation/Notes.\" Computer intruders frequently pose as hardware or\nsoftware vendors in an attempt to dupe information technology personnel\ninto creating unauthorized accounts. The intention of this policy is to\nblock these attacks by establishing greater control over the creation of\nprivileged accounts. The system manager or administrator of the computer\nsystem must approve any request to create an account with elevated\nprivileges. 7-1 3 Guest accounts\nPolicy: Guest accounts on any computer systems or related networked\ndevices shall be disabled or removed, except for an FTP (file transfer\nprotocol) server approved by management with anonymous access\nenabled. Explanation/Notes: The intention of the guest account is to provide\ntemporary access for persons who do not need to have their own account. Several operating systems are installed by default with a guest account\nenabled. Guest accounts should always be disabled because their\nexistence violates the principle of user accountability. IT should be able to\naudit any computer-related activity and relate it to a specific user. Social engineers are easily able to take advantage of these guest accounts\nfor gaining unauthorized access, either directly or by duping authorized\npersonnel into using a guest account. 7-14 Encryption of off-site backup data\nPolicy: Any company data that is stored off site should be encrypted to\nprevent unauthorized access. Explanation/Notes: Operations staff must insure that all data is\nrecoverable in the event that any information needs to be restored. This\nrequires regular test decryption of a random sampling of encrypted files to\nmake sure the data can be recovered. Furthermore, keys used to encrypt\ndata shall be escrowed with a trusted manager in the event the encryption\nkeys are lost or unavailable. 7-1 5 Visitor access to network connections\nPolicy: All publicly accessible Ethernet access points must be on a\nsegmented network to prevent unauthorized access to the internal\nnetwork. Explanation/Notes: The intention of this policy is to prevent any outsiders\nfrom connecting to the internal network when on company premises. Ethernet jacks installed in conference rooms, the cafeteria, training\ncenters, or other areas accessible to visitors shall be filtered to prevent\nunauthorized access by visitors to the corporate computer systems. The network or security administrator may choose to set up a virtual\nLAN in a switch, if available, to control access from these locations. 7-16 Dial-in modems\nPolicy: Modems used for dial-in calls shall be set to answer no earlier\nthan the fourth ring. Explanation/Notes: As depicted in the movie War Games, hackers use a\ntechnique known as war dialing to locate telephone lines that have\nmodems connected to them. The process begins with the attacker\nidentifying the telephone prefixes used in the area where the target\ncompany is located. A scanning program is then used to try every\ntelephone number\nin those prefixes, to locate those that answer with a modem. To speed up\nthe process, these programs are configured to wait for one or two rings for\na modem response before going on to try the next number. When a\ncompany sets the auto answer on modem lines to at least four rings,\nscanning programs will fail to recognize the line as a modem line. 7-1 7 Antivirus software\nPolicy: Every computer system shall have current versions of antivirus\nsoftware installed and activated. Explanation/Notes: For those businesses that do not automatically push\ndown antivirus software and pattern files (programs that recognize\npatterns common to virus software to recognize new viruses) to user\ndesktops or workstations, individual users must take the responsibility for\ninstalling and maintaining the software on their own systems, including\nany computer systems used for accessing the corporate network remotely. If feasible, this software must be set for automatic update of virus and\nTrojan signatures nightly. When pattern or signature flies are not pushed\ndown to user desktops, computer users shall have the responsibility to\nupdate pattern files at least on a weekly basis. These provisions apply to all desktop machines and laptops used to access\ncompany computer systems, and apply whether the computer is company\nproperty or personally owned. 7-18 Incoming email attachments (high security requirements)\nPolicy: In an organization with high security requirements, the corporate\nfirewall shall be configured to filter out all email attachments. Explanation/Notes: This policy applies only to businesses with high\nsecurity requirements, or to those that have no business need to receive\nattachments through electronic mail. 7-19 Authentication of software\nPolicy: All new software or software fixes or upgrades, whether on\nphysical media or obtained over the Internet, must be verified as authentic\nprior to installation. This policy is especially relevant to the information\ntechnology department when installing any software that requires system\nprivileges. Explanation/Notes: Computer software referred to in this policy includes\noperating system components, application software, hot fixes,\npatches, or any software updates. Many software manufacturers have\nimplemented methods whereby customers can check the integrity of any\ndistribution, usually by a digital signature. In any case where the integrity\ncannot be verified, the manufacturer must be consulted to verify that the\nsoftware is authentic. Computer attackers have been known to send software to a victim,\npackaged to appear as if the software manufacturer had produced it and\nshipped it to the company. It is essential that you verify any software you\nreceive as authentic, especially if unsolicited, before installing it on\ncompany systems. Note that a sophisticated attacker might find out that your organization\nhas ordered software from a manufacturer. With that information in hand,\nthe attacker can cancel the order with the real manufacturer, and order the\nsoftware himself. The software is then modified to perform some\nmalicious function, and is shipped or delivered to your company, in the\noriginal packaging, with shrink-wrapping if necessary. Once the product\nis installed, the attacker is in control. 7-20 Default passwords\nPolicy: All operating system software and hardware devices that initially\nhave a password set to a default value must have their passwords reset in\naccordance with the company password policy. Explanation/Notes: Several operating systems and computer-related\ndevices are shipped with default passwords--that is, with the same\npassword enabled on every unit sold. Failure to change default passwords\nis a grave mistake that places the company at risk. Default passwords are widely known and are available on Internet Web\nsites. In an attack, the first password an intruder tries is the manufacturer s\ndefault password. 7-21 Invalid access attempts lockout (low to medium security)\nPolicy: Especially in an organization with low to medium security\nrequirements, whenever a specified number of successive invalid login\nattempts to a particular account have been made, the account should be\nlocked out for a period of time. Explanation/Notes: All company workstations and servers must be set\nto limit the number of successive invalid attempts to sign in. This policy\nis necessary to prevent password guessing by trial and error, dictionary\nattacks, or brute force attempts to gain unauthorized access. The system administrator must configure the security settings to lock out\nan account whenever the desired threshold of successive invalid attempts\nhas been reached. It is recommended that an account be locked out for at\nleast thirty minutes after seven successive login attempts. 7-22 Invalid access attempts account disabled (high security)\nPolicy: In an organization with high security requirements, whenever a\nspecified number of successive invalid login attempts to a particular\naccount has been made, the account should be disabled until reset by the\ngroup responsible for providing account support. Explanation/Notes: All company workstations and servers must be set to\nlimit the number of successive invalid attempts to sign in. This policy is a\nnecessary control to prevent password guessing by trial and error,\ndictionary attacks, or brute force attempts to gain unauthorized access. The system administrator must configure the security settings to disable\nthe account after five invalid login attempts. Following such an attack, the\naccount holder will need to call technical support or the group responsible\nfor account support to enable the account. Prior to resetting the account,\nthe department responsible must positively identify the account holder,\nfollowing the Verification and Authorization Procedures. 7-23 Periodic change of privileged\nPolicy: All privileged account holders shall be required to change their\npasswords at least every thirty days. Explanation/Notes: Depending on operating system limitations, the\nsystems administrator must enforce this policy by configuration of\nsecurity parameters in system software. 7-24 Periodic change of user passwords\nPolicy: All account holders must change their passwords at least every\nsixty days. Explanation/Notes: With operating systems that provide this feature, the\nsystems administrator must enforce this policy by configuration of\nsecurity parameters in the software. 7-25 New account password set up\nPolicy: New computer accounts must be established with an initial\npassword that is pre-expired, requiring the account holder to select a new\npassword upon initial use. Explanation/Notes: This requirement ensures that only the account holder\nwill have knowledge of his or her password. 7-26 Boot-up passwords\nPolicy: All computer systems must be configured to require a bootup\npassword. Explanation/Notes: Computers must be configured so that when the\ncomputer is turned on, a password is required before the operating system\nwill boot. This prevents any unauthorized person from turning on and\nusing another person’s computer. This policy applies to all computers on\ncompany premises. 7-27 Password requirements for privileged accounts\nPolicy: M1 privileged accounts must have a strong password: The\npassword must:\nNot be a word found in a dictionary in any language\nBe mixed upper and lower case with at least one letter, one symbol, and\none numeral\nBe at least 12 characters in length\nNot be related to the company or individual in any way. Explanation/Notes: In most cases computer intruders will target specific\naccounts that have system privileges. Occasionally the attacker will\nexploit other vulnerabilities to gain full control over the system. The first passwords an intruder will try are the simple, commonly used\nwords found in a dictionary. Selecting strong passwords enhances the\nsecurity by reducing the chance an attacker will find the password by trial\nand error, dictionary attack, or brute force attack. 7-28 Wireless access points\nPolicy: All users who access a wireless network must use VPN (Virtual\nPrivate Network) technology to protect the corporate network. Explanation/Notes: Wireless networks are being attacked by a new\ntechnique called war driving. This technique involves simply driving or\nwalking around with a laptop equipped with an 802.11B NIC card until a\nwireless network is detected.\n\nMany companies have deployed wireless networks without even enabling\nWEP (wireless equivalency protocol), which is used to secure the wireless\nconnection through use of encryption. But even when activated, the\ncurrent version of WEP (mid-2002) is ineffective: It has been cracked\nwide open, and several Web sites are devoted to providing the means for\nlocating open wireless systems and cracking WEP-enabled wireless\naccess points. Accordingly, it is essential to add a layer of protection around the\n\n802.11B protocol by deploying VPN technology.\n7-29 Updating antivirus pattern files\nPolicy: Every computer system must be programmed to automatically\nupdate antivirus/anti-Trojan pattern files.\nExplanation/Notes: At a minimum, such updates shall occur at least\nweekly. In businesses where employees leave their computers turned on,\nit 302 is highly recommended that pattern files be updated on a nightly\nbasis.\nAntivirus software is ineffective if it is not updated to detect all new\nforms of malicious code. Since the threat of virus, worm, and Trojan\nHorse infections is substantially increased if pattern files are not updated,\nit is essential that antivirus or malicious code products be kept up to date.\nComputer Operations\n8-1 Entering commands or running programs\nPolicy.: Computer operations personnel must not enter commands or run\nprograms at the request of any person not known to them. If a situation\narises where an Unverified Person seems to have reason to make such a\nrequest, it should not be complied with without first getting manager\napproval.\nExplanation/Notes.: Computer operations employees are popular targets\nof social engineers, since their positions usually require privileged\naccount access, and the attacker expects that they will be less experienced\nand less knowledgeable about company procedures than other IT workers.\nThe intention of this policy is to add an appropriate check and balance to\nprevent social engineers from duping computer operations personnel.\n8-2 Workers with privileged accounts\nPolicy: Employees with privileged accounts must not provide assistance\nor information to any Unverified Person. In particular this refers to not\nproviding computer help (such as training on application use), accessing\nany company database, downloading software, or revealing names of\npersonnel who have remote access capabilities,\nExplanation/Notes: Social engineers often target employees with\nprivileged accounts. The intent of this policy is to direct IT staff with\nprivileged accounts to successfully handle calls that might represent social\nengineering attacks.\n8-3 Internal systems information\nPolicy: Computer Operations staff must never disclose any information\nrelated to enterprise computer systems or related devices without\npositively verifying the identity of the requester.\nExplanation/Notes: Computer intruders often contact computer operations\nemployees to obtain valuable information such as system access\nprocedures, external points for remote access, and dial-in telephone\nnumbers that are of substantial value to the attacker.\nIn companies that have technical support staff or a help desk, requests\nto the computer operations staff for information about computer systems\nor related devices should be considered unusual. Any information request\nshould be scrutinized under the corporate data classification policy to\ndetermine whether the requester is authorized to have such information.\nWhen the class of information cannot be determined, the information\nshould be considered to be Internal.\nIn some cases, outside vendor technical support will need to communicate\nwith persons who have access to enterprise computer systems. Vendors\nmust have specific contacts in the IT department so that those individuals\ncan recognize each other for verification purposes.\n8-4 Disclosure of passwords\nPolicy: Computer operations staff must never reveal their password, or\nany other passwords entrusted to them, without prior approval of an\ninformation technology manager.\nExplanation/Notes: In general terms, revealing any password to another is\nstrictly prohibited. This policy recognizes that operations personnel may\nneed to disclose a password to a third party when exigent situations arise.\nThis exception to the general policy prohibiting disclosure\nof any password requires specific approval of an information technology\nmanager. For extra precaution, this responsibility of disclosing\nauthentication information should be limited to a small group of\nindividuals who have received special training on verification procedures.\n8-5 Electronic media\nPolicy: All electronic media that contains information not designated for\npublic release shall be locked in a physically secure location.\nExplanation/Notes: The intention of this policy is to prevent physical theft\nof Sensitive information stored on electronic media.\n8-6 Backup media\nPolicy: Operations personnel should store backup media in a company\nsafe or other secure location.\nExplanation/Notes: Backup media is another prime target of computer\nintruders. An attacker is not going to spend time attempting to\ncompromise a computer system or network when the weakest link in the\nchain might be physically unprotected backup media. Once backup media\nis stolen, the attacker can compromise the confidentiality of any data\nstored on it, unless the data is encrypted. Therefore, physically securing\nbackup media is an essential process to protect the confidentiality of\ncorporate information.",
    "question": "What are the key policies and procedures outlined in the text to prevent security vulnerabilities and protect corporate information from social engineering and unauthorized access?",
    "summary": "The text outlines various security policies to protect a company's information systems. It emphasizes limiting employee contact information to prevent social engineering attacks, ensuring timely installation of security updates, and encrypting off-site data. Other policies include restricting access to internal systems, preventing unauthorized password disclosure, securing backup media, and using VPNs for wireless network access. These measures aim to reduce vulnerabilities and unauthorized access risks."

    "text": "POLICIES FOR ALL EMPLOYEES\nWhether in IT or human resources, the accounting department, or the\nmaintenance staff, there are certain security policies that every employee\nof your company must know. These policies fall into the categories of\nGeneral, Computer Use, Email Use, policies for Telecommuters, Phone\nUse, Fax Use, Voice Mail Use, and Passwords. General\n9-1 Reporting suspicious calls\nPolicy: Employees who suspect that they may be the subject of a security\nviolation, including any suspicious requests to disclose information or to\nperform action items on a computer, must immediately report the event to\nthe company’s incident reporting group. Explanation/Notes.: When a social engineer fails to convince his or her\ntarget to comply with a demand, the attacker will always try someone\nelse. By reporting a suspicious call or event, an employee takes the first\nstep in alerting the company that an attack may be under way. Thus,\nindividual employees are the first line of defense against social\nengineering attacks. 9-2 Documenting suspicious calls\nPolicy: In the event of a suspicious phone call that appears to be a social\nengineering attack, the employee shall, to the extent practical, draw out\nthe caller to learn details that might reveal what the attacker is attempting\nto accomplish, and make notes of these details for reporting purposes. Explanation/Notes: When reported to the incident reporting group, such\ndetails can help them spot the object or pattern of an attack. 9-3 Disclosure of dial-up numbers\nPolicy: Company personnel must not disclose company modem telephone\nnumbers, but should always refer such requests to the help desk or to\ntechnical support personnel. Explanation/Notes: Dial-up telephone numbers must be treated as Internal\ninformation, to be provided only to employees who have a need to know\nsuch information to carry out their job responsibilities. Social engineers routinely target employees or departments that are likely\nto be less protective of the requested information. For example, the\nattacker may call the accounts payable department masquerading as a\ntelephone company employee who is trying to resolve a billing problem. The attacker then asks for any known fax or dial-in numbers in order to\nresolve the problem. The intruder often targets an employee who is\nunlikely to realize the danger of releasing such information, or who lacks\ntraining with respect to company disclosure policy and procedures. 9-4 Corporate ID badges\nPolicy: Except when in their immediate office area, all company\npersonnel, including management and executive staff, must wear their\nemployee badges at all times. Explanation/Notes: All workers, including corporate executives, should\nbe trained and motivated to understand that wearing an ID badge is\nmandatory everywhere on company premises other than public areas and\nthe person’s own office or workgroup area. 9-5 Challenging ID badge violations\nPolicy: All employees must immediately challenge any unfamiliar person\nwho is not wearing an employee badge or visitor’s badge. Explanation/Notes: While no company wants to create a culture where\neagle-eyed employees look for a way to ensnare co-workers for venturing\ninto the hallway without their badges, nonetheless any company\nconcerned with protecting its information needs to take seriously the\nthreat of a social engineer wandering its facilities unchallenged. Motivation for employees who prove diligent in helping enforce the\nbadges-always policy may be acknowledged in familiar ways, such as\nrecognition in the company newspaper or on bulletin boards; a few hours\noff with pay; or a letter of commendation in their personnel records. 9-6 Piggybacking (passing through secure entrances)\nPolicy: Employees entering a building must not allow anyone not\npersonally known to them to follow behind them when they have used a\nsecure means, such as a card key, to gain entrance (piggybacking). Explanation/Notes.\" Employees must understand that it is not rude to\nrequire unknown persons to authenticate themselves before helping them\nenter a facility or access a secure area. Social engineers frequently use a technique known as piggybacking, in\nwhich they lie in wait for another person who is entering a facility or\nSensitive area, and then simply enter with them. Most people feel\nuncomfortable challenging others, assuming that they are probably\nlegitimate employees. Another piggybacking technique is to carry several\nboxes so that an unsuspecting worker opens or holds the door to help. 9-7 Shredding Sensitive documents\nPolicy: Sensitive documents to be discarded must be cross-shredded;\nmedia including hard drives that have ever contained Sensitive\ninformation or materials must be destroyed in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth by the group responsible for information security. Explanation/Notes: Standard shredders do not adequately destroy\ndocuments; cross-shredders turn documents into pulp. The best security\npractice is to presume that the organization’s chief competitors will be\nrifling through discarded materials looking for any intelligence that could\nbe beneficial to them. Industrial spies and computer attackers regularly obtain Sensitive\ninformation from materials tossed in the trash. In some cases, business\ncompetitors have been known to attempt bribery of cleaning crews to turn\nover company trash. In one recent example, an employee at Goldman\nSachs discovered items that were used in an insider-trading scheme from\nthe trash. 9-8 Personal identifiers\nPolicy: Personal identifiers such as employee number, social security\nnumber, driver’s license number, date and place of birth, and mother’s\nmaiden name should never be used as a means of verifying identity. These\nidentifiers are not secret and can be obtained by numerous means. Explanation/Notes: A social engineer can obtain other people’s personal\nidentifiers for a price. And in fact, contrary to popular belief, anyone with\na credit card and access to the Internet can obtain these pieces of personal\nidentification. Yet despite the obvious danger, banks, utility companies,\nand credit card companies commonly use these identifiers. This is one\nreason that identity theft is the fastest growing crime of the decade. 9-9 Organization charts\nPolicy.\" Details shown on the company’s organization chart must not be\ndisclosed to anyone other than company employees. Explanation/Notes: Corporate structure information includes organization\ncharts, hierarchy charts, departmental employee lists, reporting structure,\nemployee names, employee positions, internal contact numbers, employee\nnumbers, or similar information. In the first phase of a social engineering attack, the goal is to gather\ninformation about the internal structure of the company. This information\nis then used to strategize an attack plan. The attacker can also analyze this\ninformation to determine which employees are likely to have access to the\ndata that he seeks. During the attack, the information makes the attacker\nappear as a knowledgeable employee; making it more likely he’ll dupe his\nvictim into compliance. 9-10 Private information about employees\nPolicy.: Any requests for private employee information must be referred\nto human resources. Explanation/Notes: An exception to this policy may be the telephone\nnumber for an employee who needs to be contacted regarding a work-\nrelated issue or who is acting in an on-call role. However, it is always\npreferable to get the requester’s phone number, and have the employee\ncall him or her back. Computer Use\n10-1 Entering commands into a computer\nPolicy: Company personnel should never enter commands into a\ncomputer or computer-related equipment at the request of another person\nunless the requester has been verified as an employee of the information\ntechnology department. Explanation/Notes: One common ploy of social engineers is to request\nthat an employee enter a command that makes a change to the system’s\nconfiguration, allows the attacker to access the victim’s computer without\nproviding authentication, or allows the attacker to retrieve information\nthat can be used to facilitate a technical attack. 10-2 Internal naming conventions\nPolicy: Employees must not disclose the internal names of computer\nsystems or databases without prior verification that the requester is\nemployed by the company. Explanation/Notes: Social engineers will sometimes attempt to obtain the\nnames of company computer systems; once the names are known, the\nattacker places a call to the company and masquerades as a legitimate\nemployee having trouble accessing or using one of the systems. By\nknowing the internal name assigned to the particular system, the social\nengineer gains credibility. 10-3 Requests to run programs\nPolicy: Company personnel should never run any computer applications\nor programs at the request of another person unless the requester has been\nverified as an employee of the information technology department. Explanation/Notes: Any request to run programs, applications, or perform\nany activity on a computer must be refused unless the requester is\npositively identified as an employee in the information technology\ndepartment. If the request involves revealing Confidential information\nfrom any\nfile or electronic message, responding to the request must be in\naccordance with the procedures for releasing Confidential information. See Information Disclosure Policy. Computer attackers deceive people into executing programs that enable\nthe intruder to gain control of the system. When an unsuspecting user runs\na program planted by an attacker, the result may give the intruder access\nto the victim’s computer system. Other programs record the activities of\nthe computer user and return that information to the attacker. While a\nsocial engineer can trick a person into executing computer instructions\nthat may do damage, a technically based attack tricks the computer’s\noperating system into executing computer instructions that may cause the\nsame sort of damage. 10-4 Downloading or installing software\nPolicy: Company personnel must never download or install software at\nthe request of another person, unless the requester has been verified as an\nemployee with the information technology department. Explanation/Notes: Employees should be on the alert for any unusual\nrequest that involves any sort of transaction with computer-related\nequipment. A common tactic used by social engineers is to deceive unsuspecting\nvictims into downloading and installing a program that helps the attacker\naccomplish his or her goal of compromising computer or network\nsecurity. In some instances, the program may covertly spy on the user or\nallow the attacker to take control of the computer system through use of a\ncovert remote control application. 10-5 Plain text passwords and email\nPolicy: Passwords shall not be sent through email unless encrypted. Explanation/Notes: While it’s discouraged, this policy may be waived\nby e-commerce sites in certain limited circumstances, such as:\nSending passwords to customers who have registered on the site. Sending passwords to customers who have lost or forgotten their\npasswords. 10-6 Security-related software\nPolicy: Company personnel must never remove or disable antivirus/\nTrojan Horse, firewall, or other security-related software without prior\napproval from the information technology department. Explanation/Notes: Computer users sometimes disable security-related\nsoftware without provocation, thinking it will increase the speed of their\ncomputer. A social engineer may attempt to deceive an employee into disabling or\nremoving software that is needed to protect the company against security-\nrelated threats. 10-7 Installation of modems\nPolicy.. No modems may be connected to any computer until prior\napproval has been obtained from the IT department. Explanation/Notes.: It is important to recognize that modems on desktops\nor workstations in the workplace pose a substantial security threat,\nespecially if connected to the corporate network. Accordingly, this policy\ncontrols modem connection procedures. Hackers use a technique called war dialing to identify any active modem\nlines within a range of telephone numbers. The same technique may be\nused to locate telephone numbers connected to modems within the\nenterprise. An attacker can easily compromise the corporate network if he\nor she identifies a computer system connected to a modem running\nvulnerable remote access software, which is configured with an easily\nguessed password or no password at all. 10-8 Modems and auto-answer settings\nPolicy: M1 desktops or workstations with IT-approved modems shall\nhave the modem auto-answer feature disabled to prevent anyone from\ndialing into the computer system. Explanation/Notes.- Whenever feasible, the information technology\ndepartment should deploy a dial-out modem pool for those employees\nwho need to dial out to external computer systems via modem. 10-9 Cracking tools\nPolicy: Employees will not download or use any software tools designed\nto defeat software protection mechanisms. Explanation/Notes: The Internet has dozens of sites devoted to software\ndesigned to crack shareware and commercial software products. The use\nof these tools not only violates a software owner’s copyright, but also is\nextremely dangerous. Because these programs originate from unknown\nsources, they may contain hidden malicious code that may cause damage\nto the user’s computer or plant a Trojan Horse that gives the author of the\nprogram access to the user’s computer. 10-10 Posting company information on line\nPolicy: Employees shall not disclose any details regarding company\nhardware or software in any public newsgroup, forum, or bulletin board,\nand shall not disclose contact information other than in accordance with\npolicy. Explanation/Notes: Any message posted to the Usenet, on-line forums,\nbulletin boards, or mailing lists can be searched to gather intelligence on a\ntarget company or a target individual. During the research phase of a\nsocial engineering attack, the attacker may search the Internet for any\nposts that contain useful information about the company, its products or\nits people. Some posts contain very useful tidbits of information that the attacker\ncan use to further an attack. For example, a network administrator may\npost a question about configuring firewall filters on a particular brand and\nmodel of firewall. An attacker who discovers this message will learn\nvaluable information about the type and configuration of the companys\nfirewall that enables him to circumvent it to gain access to the enterprise\nnetwork. This problem can be reduced or avoided by implementing a policy that\nallows employees to post to newsgroups from anonymous accounts that\ndo not identify the company from which they originated. Naturally, the\npolicy must require employees not to include any contact information that\nmay identify the company.\n\n10-11 Floppy disks and other electronic media\nPolicy: If media used to store computer information, such as floppy\ndisks or CD-ROMS have been left in a work area or on an employee’s\ndesk, and that media is from an unknown source, it must not be inserted\ninto any computer system. Explanation/Notes: One method used by attackers to install malicious\ncode is to place programs onto a floppy or CD-ROM and label it with\nsomething very enticing (for example, \"Personnel Payroll Data--\nConfidential\"). They then drop several copies in areas used by employees. If a single copy is inserted into a computer and the files on it opened, the\nattacker’s malicious code is executed. This may create a backdoor, which\nis used to compromise the system, or may cause other damage to the\nnetwork. 10-1 2 Discarding removable media\nPolicy: Before discarding any electronic media that ever contained\nSensitive company information, even if that information has been deleted,\nthe item shall be thoroughly degaussed or damaged beyond recovery. Explanation/Notes: While shredding hard-copy documents is\ncommonplace these days, company workers may overlook the threat of\ndiscarding electronic media that contained Sensitive data ar any rime. Computer attackers attempt to recover any data stored on discarded\nelectronic media. Workers may presume that by just deleting files, they\nensure that those files cannot be recovered. This presumption is absolutely\nincorrect and can cause confidential business information to fall into the\nwrong hands. Accordingly, all electronic media that contains or\npreviously contained information not designated as Public must be wiped\nclean or destroyed using the procedures approved by the responsible\ngroup. 10-1 3 Password-protected screen savers\nPolicy: All computer users must set a screen saver password and the\ninactivity time-out limit to lock the computer after a certain period of\ninactivity. Explanation/Notes: All employees are responsible for setting a screen\nsaver password, and setting the inactivity timeout for no more than ten\nminutes. The intention of this policy is to prevent any unauthorized person\nfrom using another person’s computer. Additionally, this policy protects\ncompany computer systems from being easily accessed by outsiders who\nhave gained access to the building. 10-1 4 Disclosure or sharing of passwords statement\nPolicy: Prior to creation of a new computer account, the employee or\ncontractor must sign a written statement acknowledging that he or she\nunderstands that passwords must never be disclosed or shared with\nanyone, and that he or she agrees to abide by this policy. Explanation/Notes: The agreement should also include a notice that\nviolation of such agreement may lead to disciplinary action up to and\nincluding termination. Email Use\n1 1-1 Email attachments\nPolicy: Email attachments must not be opened unless the attachment was\nexpected in the course of business or was sent by a Trusted Person. Explanation/Notes: All email attachments must be scrutinized closely. You may require that prior notice be given by a Trusted Person that an\nemail attachment is being sent before the recipient opens any attachment. This will reduce the risk of attackers using social engineering tactics to\ndeceive people into opening attachments. One method of compromising a computer system is to trick an\nemployee into running a malicious program that creates a vulnerability,\nproviding the attacker with access to the system. By sending an email\nattachment that has executable code or macros, the attacker may be able\nto gain control of the user’s computer. A social engineer may send a malicious email attachment, then call and\nattempt to persuade the recipient to open the attachment. 11-2 Automatic forwarding to external addresses\nPolicy: Automatic forwarding of incoming email to an external email\naddress is prohibited. Explanation/Notes: The intention of this policy is to prevent an outsider\nfrom receiving email sent to an internal email address. Employees occasionally set up email forwarding of their incoming mail to\nan email address outside the company when they will be away from the\noffice. Or an attacker may be able to deceive an employee into setting up\nan internal email address that forwards to an address outside the company. The attacker can then pose as a legitimate insider by having an internal\ncompany email address and get people to email Sensitive information to\nthe internal email address. 1 1-3 Forwarding emails\nPolicy: Any request from an Unverified Person to relay an electronic mail\nmessage to another Unverified Person requires verification of the\nrequester’s identity. 1 1-4 Verifying email\nPolicy: An email message that appears to be from a Trusted Person that\ncontains a request to provide information not designated as Public, or to\nperform an action with any computer-related equipment, requires an\nadditional form of authentication. See Verification and Authorization\nProcedures. Explanation/Notes: An attacker can easily forge an email message and its\nheader, making it appear as if the message originated from another email\naddress. An attacker can also send an email message from a compromised\ncomputer system, providing phony authorization to disclose information\nor perform an action. Even by examining the header of an email message\nyou cannot detect email messages sent from a compromised internal\ncomputer system. Phone Use\n12-1 Participating in telephone surveys\nPolicy: Employees may not participate in surveys by answering any\nquestions from any outside organization or person. Such requests must be\nreferred to the public relations department or other designated person. Explanation/Notes: A method used by social engineers to obtain valuable\ninformation that may be used against the enterprise is to call an employee\nand claim to be doing a survey. It’s surprising how many people are happy\nto provide information about the company and themselves to strangers\nwhen they believe they’re taking part in legitimate research. Among the\ninnocuous questions, the caller will insert a few questions that the attacker\nwants to know. Eventually, such information may be used to compromise\nthe corporate network. 12-2 Disclosure of internal telephone numbers\nPolicy: If an Unverified Person asks an employee for his phone number\nthe employee may make a reasonable determination of whether disclosure\nis necessary to conduct company business. Explanation/Notes: The intention of this policy is to require employees to\nmake a considered decision on whether disclosure of their telephone\nextension is necessary. When dealing with people who have not\ndemonstrated a genuine need to know the extension, the safest course is to\nrequire them to call the main company phone number and be transferred. 1 2-3 Passwords in voice mail messages\nPolicy.: Leaving messages containing password information on anyone’s\nvoice mailbox is prohibited. Explanation/Notes: A social engineer can often gain access to an\nemployee’s voice mailbox because it is inadequately protected with an\neasy-to-guess access code. In one type of attack, a sophisticated computer\nintruder is able to create his own phony voice mailbox and persuade\nanother employee to leave a message relaying password information. This\npolicy defeats such a ruse. Fax Use\n13-1 Relaying faxes\nPolicy: No fax may be received and forwarded to another party without\nverification of the requester’s identity. Explanation/Notes: Information thieves may trick trusted employees into\nfaxing sensitive information to a fax machine located on the company’s\npremises. Prior to the attacker giving the fax number to the victim, the\nimposter telephones an unsuspecting employee, such as a secretary or\nadministrative assistant, and asks if a document can be faxed to them for\nlater pickup. Subsequently, after the unsuspecting employee receives the\nfax, the attacker telephones the employee and requests that the fax be sent\nto another location, perhaps claiming that it is needed for an urgent\nmeeting. Since the person asked to relay the fax usually has no\nunderstanding of the value of the information, he or she complies with the\nrequest. 1 3-2 Verification of faxed authorizations\nPolicy: Prior to carrying out any instructions received by facsimile, the\nsender must be verified as an employee or other Trusted Person. Placing a\ntelephone call to the sender to verify the request is usually sufficient. Explanation/Notes: Employees must exercise caution when unusual\nrequests are sent by fax, such as a request to enter commands into a\ncomputer or disclose information. The data in the header of a faxed\ndocument can be falsified by changing the settings of the sending fax\nmachine. Therefore the header on a fax must not be accepted as a means\nof establishing identity or authorization. 1 3-3 Sending sensitive information by fax\nPolicy: Before sending Sensitive information by fax to a machine that is\nlocated in an area accessible to other personnel, the sender shall transmit a\ncover page. The recipient, on receiving the page, transmits a page in\nresponse, demonstrating that he/he is physically present at the fax\nmachine. The sender then transmits the fax. Explanation/Notes: This handshake process assures the sender that the\nrecipient is physically present at the receiving end. Moreover, this process\nverifies that the receiving fax telephone number has not been forwarded to\nanother location. 1 3-4 Faxing passwords prohibited\nPolicy: Passwords must not be sent via facsimile under any\ncircumstances. Explanation/Notes: Sending authentication information by facsimile is not\nsecure. Most fax machines are accessible to a number of employees. Furthermore, they rely on the public telephone switched network, which\ncan be manipulated by call forwarding the phone number for the receiving\nfax machine so that the fax is actually sent to the attacker at another\nnumber. Voice Mail Use\n14-1 Voice mail passwords\nPolicy: Voice mail passwords must never be disclosed to anyone for any\npurpose. In addition, voice mail passwords must be changed every ninety\ndays or sooner. Explanation/Notes: Confidential company information may be left in\nvoice mail messages. To protect this information, employees should\nchange their voice mail passwords frequently, and never disclose them. In\naddition, voice mail users should not use the same or similar voice mail\npasswords within a twelve-month period. 14-2 Passwords on multiple systems\nPolicy.. Voice mail users must not use the same password on any other\nphone or computer system, whether internal or external to the company. Explanation/Notes.\" Use of a similar or identical password for multiple\ndevices, such as voice mail and computer, makes it easier for social\nengineers to guess all the passwords of a user after identifying only one. 14-3 Setting voice mail passwords\nPolicy: Voice mail users and administrators must create voice mail\npasswords that are difficult to guess. They must not be related in any way\nto the person using it, or the company, and should not contain a\npredictable pattern that is likely to be guessed. Explanation/Notes: Passwords must not contain sequential or repeating\ndigits (i.e. 1111, 1234, 1010), must not be the same as or based on the\ntelephone extension number, and must not be related to address, zip code,\nbirth date, license plate, phone number, weight, I.Q., or other predictable\npersonal information. 1 4-4 Mail messages marked as \"old\"\nPolicy: When previously unheard voice mail messages are not marked as\nnew messages, the voice mail administrator must be notified of a possible\nsecurity violation and the voice mail password must immediately be\nchanged. Explanation/Notes: Social engineers may gain access to a voice mailbox\nin a variety of ways. An employee who becomes aware that messages\nthey have never listened to are not being announced as new messages\nmust assume that another person has obtained unauthorized access to the\nvoice mailbox and listened to the messages themselves. 1 4-5 External voice mail greetings\nPolicy: Company workers shall limit their disclosure of information on\ntheir external outgoing greeting on their voice mail. Ordinarily\ninformation related to a worker’s daily routine or travel schedule should\nnot be disclosed. Explanation/Notes: An external greeting (played to outside callers) should\nnot include last name, extension, or reason for absence (such as travel,\nvacation schedule, or daily itinerary). An attacker can use this information\nto develop a plausible story in his attempt to dupe other personnel. 1 4-6 Voice mail password patterns\nPolicy: Voice mail users shall not select a password where one part of the\npassword remains fixed, while another part changes in a predictable\npattern. Explanation/Notes: For example, do not use a password such as 743501,\n743502, 743503, and so on, where the last two digits correspond to the\ncurrent month. 1 4-7 Confidential or Private information\nPolicy: Confidential or Private information shall not be disclosed in a\nvoice mail message. Explanation/Notes: The corporate telephone system is typically more\nvulnerable than corporate computer systems. The passwords are usually a\nstring of digits, which substantially limits the number of possibilities for\nan attacker to guess. Further, in some organizations, voice mail passwords\nmay be shared with secretaries or another administrative staff who have\nthe responsibility of taking messages for their managers. In light of the\nabove, no Sensitive information should ever be left on anyone’s voice\nmail. Passwords\n1 5-1 Telephone security\nPolicy: Passwords shall not be disclosed over the telephone at any time. Explanation/Notes: Attackers may find ways to listen in to phone\nconversations, either in person or through a technological device. 1 5-2 Revealing computer passwords\nPolicy: Under no circumstances shall any computer user reveal his or her\npassword to anyone for any purpose without prior written consent of the\nresponsible information technology manager. Explanation/Notes: The goal of many social engineering attacks involves\ndeceiving unsuspecting persons into revealing their account names and\npasswords. This policy is a crucial step in reducing the risk of successful\nsocial engineering attacks against the enterprise. Accordingly, this policy\nneeds to be followed religiously throughout the company. 1 5-3 Internet passwords\nPolicy: Personnel must never use a password that is the same as or similar\nto one they are using on any corporate system on an Internet site.\n\nExplanation/Notes: Malicious Web site operators may set up a site that\npurports to offer something of value or the possibility of winning a prize. To register, a visitor to the site must enter an email address, username,\nand password. Since many people use the same or similar sign-on\ninformation repeatedly, the malicious Web site operator will attempt to\nuse the chosen password and variations of it for attacking the target’s\nwork- or home- computer system. The visitor’s work computer can\nsometimes be identified by the email address entered during the\nregistration process. 1 5-4 Passwords on multiple systems\nPolicy: Company personnel must never use the same or a similar\npassword in more than one system. This policy pertains to various types\nof devices (computer or voice mail); various locations of devices (home\nor work); and various types of systems, devices (router or firewall), or\nprograms (database or application). Explanation/Notes: Attackers rely on human nature to break into\ncomputer systems and networks. They know that, to avoid the hassle of\nkeeping track of several passwords, many people use the same or a similar\npassword on every system they access. As such, the intruder will attempt\nto learn the password of one system where the target has an account. Once\nobtained, it’s highly likely that this password or a variation thereof will\ngive access to other systems and devices used by the employee. 1 5-5 Reusing passwords\nPolicy: No computer user shall use the same or a similar password within\nthe same eighteen-month period. Explanation/Note: If an attacker does discover a user’s password, frequent\nchanging of the password minimizes the damage that can be done. Making the new password unique from previous passwords makes it\nharder for the attacker to guess it. 1 5-6 Password patterns\nPolicy.\" Employees must not select a password where one part remains\nfixed, and another element changes in a predictable pattern. Explanation/Notes: For example, do not use a password such as Kevin01,\nKevin02, Kevin03, and so on, where the last two digits correspond to the\ncurrent month. 1 5-7 Choosing passwords\nPolicy: Computer users should create or choose a password that adheres\nto the following requirements. The password must:\nBe at least eight characters long for standard user accounts and at least\ntwelve characters long for privileged accounts. Contain at least one number, at least one symbol (such as $, -, I, &), at\nleast one lowercase letter, and at least one upper-case letter (to the extent\nthat such variables are supported by the operating system). Not be any of the following items: words in a dictionary in any language;\nany word that is related to an employee’s family, hobbies, vehicle, work,\nlicense plate, social security number, address, telephone, pet’s name,\nbirthday, or phrases containing those words. Not be a variation of a previously used password, with one element\nremaining the same and another element changing, such as kevin, kevin 1,\nkevin2; or kevinjan, kevinfeb. Explanation/Notes: The parameters listed above will produce a password\nthat is difficult for the social engineer to guess. Another option is the\nconsonant-vowel method, which provides an easy-to-remember and\npronounceable password. To construct this kind of password substitute\nconsonants for each letter C and vowels for the letter V, using the mask of\n\"CVCVCVCV.\" Examples would be MIXOCASO; CUSOJENA. 1 5-8 Writing passwords down\nPolicy: Employees should write passwords down only when they store\nthem in a secure location away from the computer or other password\nprotected device. Explanation/Notes: Employees are discouraged from ever writing down\npasswords. Under certain conditions, however, it may be necessary; for\nexample, for an employee who has multiple accounts on different\ncomputer systems. Any written passwords must be secured in a safe place\naway from the computer. Under no circumstances may a password be\nstored under the keyboard or attached to the computer display. 1 5-9 Plaintext passwords in computer files\nPolicy: Plaintext passwords shall not be saved in any computer file or\nstored as text called by pressing a function key. When necessary,\npasswords may be saved using an encryption utility approved by the IT\ndepartment to prevent any unauthorized disclosures. Explanation/Notes: Passwords can be easily recovered by an attacker if\nstored in unencrypted form in computer data files, batch files, terminal\nfunction keys, login files, macro or scripting programs, or any data files\nwhich contain passwords to FTP sites.",

    "text": "POLICIES FOR TELECOMMUTERS\nTelecommuters are outside the corporate firewall, and therefore more\nvulnerable to attack. These policies will help you prevent social engineers\nfrom using your telecommuter employees as a gateway to your data.\n16-1 Thin clients\nPolicy: All company personnel who have been authorized to connect via\nremote access shall use a thin client to connect to the corporate network.\nExplanation/Notes: When an attacker analyzes an attack strategy, he or\nshe will try to identify users who access the corporate network from\nexternal locations. As such, telecommuters are prime targets. Their\ncomputers are less likely to have stringent security controls, and may be a\nweak link that may compromise the corporate network.\nAny computer that connects to a trusted network can be booby-trapped\nwith keystroke loggers, or their authenticated connection can be hijacked.\nA thin client strategy can be used to avoid problems. A thin client is\nsimilar to a diskless workstation or a dumb terminal; the remote computer\ndoes not have storage capabilities but instead the operating system,\napplication programs, and data all reside on the corporate network.\nAccessing the network via a thin client substantially reduces the risk\nposed by un-patched systems, outdated operating systems, and malicious\ncode. Accordingly, managing the security of telecommuters is effective\nand made easier by centralizing security controls. Rather than relying on\nthe inexperienced telecommuter to properly manage security-related\nissues, these responsibilities are better left with trained system, network,\nor security administrators.\n16-2 Security software for telecommuter computer systems\nPolicy: Any external computer system that is used to connect to the\ncorporate network must have antivirus software, anti-Trojan software, and\na personal firewall (hardware or software). Antivirus and anti-Trojan\npattern files must be updated at least weekly.\nExplanation/Notes: Ordinarily, telecommuters are not skilled on security-\nrelated issues, and may inadvertently\" or negligently leave their computer\nsystem and the corporate network open to attack. Telecommuters\ntherefore pose a serious security risk if they are not properly trained. In\naddition to installing antivirus and anti-Trojan Horse software to protect\nagainst malicious code, a firewall is necessary to block any hostile users\nfrom obtaining access to any services enabled on the telecommuter’s\nsystem.\nThe risk of not deploying the minimal security technologies to prevent\nmalicious code from propagating cannot be underestimated, as an attack\non Microsoft proves. A computer system belonging to a Microsoft\ntelecommuter, used to connect to Microsoft’s corporate network, became\ninfected with a Trojan Horse program. The intruder or intruders were able\nto use the telecommuter’s trusted connection to Microsoft’s development\nnetwork to steal developmental source code.",
    "question": "What security measures should telecommuters follow to protect the corporate network from attacks?",
    "summary": "Telecommuters are more vulnerable to attacks because they access the corporate network from outside the firewall. To mitigate this risk, policies recommend using thin clients to reduce security threats and ensure that telecommuters' computers have antivirus, anti-Trojan, and firewall software with regular updates. These measures help prevent malicious code from spreading and protect the corporate network by centralizing security controls."

    "text": "POLICIES FOR HUMAN RESOURCES\nHuman resources departments have a special charge to protect employees\nfrom those attempting to discover personal information through their\nworkplace. HR professionals also have a responsibility to protect their\ncompany from the actions of unhappy ex-employees.\n1 7-1 Departing employees\nPolicy: Whenever a person employed by the company leaves or is\nterminated, Human Resources must immediately do the following:\nRemove the person’s listing from the on-line employee/telephone\ndirectory and disable or forward their voice mail;\nNotify personnel at building entrances or company lobbies; and\nAdd the employee’s name to the employee departure list, which shall be\nemailed to all personnel no less often than once a week.\nExplanation/Notes: Employees who are stationed at building entrances\nmust be notified to prevent a former employee from re-entering the\npremises. Further, notifying other personnel may prevent the former\nemployee from successfully masquerading as an active employee and\nduping personnel into taking some action damaging to the company.\nIn some circumstances, it may be necessary to require every user within\nthe former employee’s department to change his or her passwords. (When\nI was terminated from GTE solely because of my reputation as a hacker,\nthe company required all employees throughout the company to change\ntheir password.)\n1 7-2 IT department notification\nPolicy: Whenever a person employed by the company leaves or is\nterminated, Human Resources should immediately notify the information\ntechnology department to disable the former employee’s computer\naccounts, including any accounts used for database access, dial-up, or\nInternet access from remote locations.\nExplanation/Notes: It’s essential to disable any former worker’s access to\nall computer systems, network devices, databases, or any other computer-\nrelated devices immediately upon termination. Otherwise, the company\nmay leave the door wide open for a disgruntled employee to access\ncompany computer systems and cause significant damage.\n1 7-3 Confidential information used in hiring process\nPolicy: Advertisements and other forms of public solicitation of\ncandidates to fill job openings should, to the extent possible, avoid\nidentifying computer hardware and software used by the company.\nExplanation/Notes: Managers and human resources personnel should only\ndisclose information related to enterprise computer hardware and software\nthat is reasonably necessary to obtain resumes from qualified candidates.\nComputer intruders read newspapers and company press releases, and\nvisit Internet sites, to find job listings. Often, companies disclose too\nmuch information about the types of hardware and software used to attract\nprospective employees. Once the intruder has knowledge of the target’s\ninformation systems, he is armed for the next phase of attack. For\nexample, by knowing that a particular company uses the VMS operating\nsystem, the attacker may place pretext calls to determine the release\nversion, and then send a phony emergency security patch made to appear\nas if it came from the software developer. Once the patch is installed, the\nattacker is in.\n1 7-4 Employee personal information\nPolicy: The human resources department must never release personal\ninformation about any current or former employee, contractor, consultant,\ntemporary worker, or intern, except with prior express written consent of\nthe employee or human resources manager.\nExplanation/Notes: Head-hunters, private investigators, and identity\nthieves target private employee information such as employee numbers,\nsocial security numbers, birth dates, salary history, financial data\nincluding direct deposit information, and health-related benefit\ninformation. The social engineer may obtain this information so as to\nmasquerade as the individual. In addition, disclosing the names of new\nhires may be extremely valuable to information thieves. New hires are\nlikely to comply with any request by persons with seniority or in a\nposition of authority, or anyone claiming to be from corporate security.\n1 7-5 Background checks\nPolicy: A background check should be required for all new hires,\ncontractors, consultants, temporary workers, or interns prior to an offer of\nemployment or establishing of a contractual relationship.\nExplanation/Notes: Because of cost considerations, the requirement for\nbackground checks may be limited to specific positions of trust. Note,\nhowever, that any person who is given physical access to corporate offices\nmay be a potential threat. For example, cleaning crews have access to\npersonnel offices, which gives them access to any computer systems\nlocated there. An attacker with physical access to a computer can install a\nhardware keystroke logger in less than a minute to capture passwords.\nComputer intruders will sometimes go to the effort of obtaining a job as a\nmeans of gaining access to a target company’s computer systems and\nnetworks. An attacker can easily obtain the name of a company’s cleaning\ncontractor by calling the responsible employee at the target company,\nclaiming to be from a janitorial company looking for their business, and\nthen obtaining the name of the company that is currently providing such\nservices.\n\nPOLICIES FOR PHYSICAL SECURITY\nThough social engineers try to avoid showing up in person at a workplace\nthey want to target, there are times when they will violate your space.\nThese policies will help you to keep your physical premises secure from\nthreat.\n18-1 Identification for non employees\nPolicy: Delivery people and other non employees who need to enter\ncompany premises on a regular basis must have a special badge or other\nform of identification in accordance with policy established by corporate\nsecurity.\nExplanation/Notes: Non employees who need to enter the building\nregularly (for example, to make food or beverage deliveries to the\ncafeteria, or to repair copying machines or install telephones) should be\nissued a special form of company identification badge provided for this\npurpose. Others who need to enter only occasionally or on a one-time\nbasis must be treated as visitors and should be escorted at all times.\n18-2 Visitor identification\nPolicy: All visitors must present a valid driver’s license or other picture\nidentification to be admitted to the premises.\nExplanation/Notes: The security staff or receptionist should make a\nphotocopy of the identification document prior to issuing a visitor’s badge.\nThe copy should be kept with the visitor’s log. Alternatively, the\nidentification information can be recorded in the visitor’s log by the\nreceptionist or guard; visitors should not be permitted to write down their\nown ID information.\nSocial engineers seeking to gain entrance to a building will always write\nfalse information in the log. Even though it’s not difficult to obtain false\nID and to learn the name of an employee he or she can claim to be\nvisiting, requiring that the responsible employee must log the entry adds\none level of security to the process.\n18-3 Escorting visitors\nPolicy: Visitors must be escorted or in the company of an employee at all\ntimes.\nExplanation/Notes.: One popular ruse of social engineers is to arrange\nto visit a company employee (for example, visiting with a product\nengineer on the pretext of being the employee of a strategic partner). After\nbeing escorted to the initial meeting, the social engineer assures his host\nthat he can find his own way back to the lobby. By this means he gains\nthe freedom to roam the building and possibly gain access to Sensitive\ninformation.\n1 8-4 Temporary badges\nPolicy: Company employees from-another location who do not have their\nemployee badges with them must present a valid driver’s license or other\npicture ID and be issued a temporary visitor’s badge.\nExplanation/Notes: Attackers often pose as employees from a different\noffice or branch of a company to gain entrance to a company.\n1 8-5 Emergency evacuation\nPolicy: In any emergency situation or drill, security personnel must ensure\nthat everybody has evacuated the premises.\nExplanation/Notes: Security personnel must check for any stragglers that\nmay be left behind in restrooms or office areas. As authorized by the fire\ndepartment or other authority in charge of the scene, the security force\nneeds to be on the alert for anyone departing the building long after the\nevacuation.\nIndustrial spies or sophisticated computer intruders may cause a diversion\nto gain access to a building or secure area. One diversion used is to\nrelease a harmless chemical known as butyl mercaptan into the air. The\neffect is to create the impression that there is a natural gas leak. Once\npersonnel start evacuation procedures, the bold attacker uses this\ndiversion to either steal information or to gain access to enterprise\ncomputer systems. Another tactic used by information thieves involves\nremaining behind, sometimes in a restroom or closet, at the time of a\nscheduled evacuation drill, or after setting off a smoke flare or other\ndevice to cause an emergency evacuation.\n18-6 Visitors in mail room\nPolicy: No visitors should be permitted in the mail room without the\nsupervision of a company worker.\nExplanation/Notes: The intention of this policy is to prevent an outsider\nfrom exchanging, sending, or stealing intracompany mail.\n1 8-7 Vehicle license plate numbers\nPolicy: If the company has a guarded parking area, security staff shall log\nvehicle license plate numbers for any vehicle entering the area.\n1 8-8 Trash Dumpsters\nPolicy: Trash Dumpsters must remain on company premises at all times\nand should be inaccessible to the public.\nExplanation/Notes: Computer attackers and industrial spies can obtain\nvaluable information from company trash bins. The courts have held that\ntrash is considered legally abandoned property, so the act of Dumpster\ndiving is perfectly legal, as long as the trash receptacles are on public\nproperty. For this reason, it is important that trash receptacles be situated\non\ncompany property, where the company has a legal right to protect the\ncontainers and their contents.\n\nPOLICIES FOR RECEPTIONISTS\nReceptionists are often on the front lines when it comes to dealing with\nsocial engineers, yet they are rarely given enough security training to\nrecognize and stop an invader. Institute these policies to help your\nreceptionist better protect your company and its data.\n19-1 Internal directory\nPolicy: Disclosure of information in the internal company directory\nshould be limited to persons employed by the company.\nExplanation/Notes: All employee titles, names, telephone numbers, and\naddresses contained within the company directory should be considered\nInternal information, and should only be disclosed in accordance with the\npolicy related to data classification and Internal information.\nAdditionally, any calling party must have the name or extension of the\nparty they are trying to contact. Although the receptionist can put a call\nthrough to an individual when a caller does not know the extension,\ntelling the caller the extension number should be prohibited. (For those\ncurious folks who follow by example, you can experience this procedure\nby calling any U.S. government agency and asking the operator to\nprovide an extension.)\n19-2 Telephone numbers for specific departments/groups\nPolicy: Employees shall not provide direct telephone numbers for the\ncompany help desk, telecommunications department, computer\noperations, or system administrator personnel without verifying that the\nrequester has a legitimate need to contact these groups. The receptionist,\nwhen transferring a call to these groups, must announce the caller’s name.\nExplanation/Notes: Although some organizations may find this policy\noverly restrictive, this rule makes it more difficult for a social engineer to\nmasquerade as an employee by deceiving other employees into\ntransferring the call from their extension (which in some phone systems\ncauses the call to appear to originate from within the company), or\ndemonstrating knowledge of these extensions to the victim in order to\ncreate a sense of authenticity.\n1 9-3 Relaying information\nPolicy: Telephone operators and receptionists should not take messages or\nrelay information on behalf of any party not personally known to be an\nactive employee.\nExplanation/Notes: Social engineers are adept at deceiving employees\ninto inadvertently vouching for their identity. One social engineering trick\nis to obtain the telephone number of the receptionist and, on a pretext, ask\nthe receptionist to take any messages that may come for him. Then, during\na call to the victim, the attacker pretends to be an employee, asks for some\nsensitive information or to perform a task, and gives the main switchboard\nnumber as a call back number. The attacker later calls back to the\nreceptionist and is given any message left for him by the unsuspecting\nvictim.\n19-4 Items left for pickup\nPolicy: Before releasing any item to a messenger or other Unverified\nPerson, the receptionist or security guard must obtain picture\nidentification and enter the identification information into the pickup log\nas required by approved procedures.\nExplanation/Notes.\" One social engineering tactic is to deceive an\nemployee into releasing sensitive materials to another supposedly\nauthorized employee by dropping off such materials at the receptionist or\nlobby desk for pickup. Naturally, the receptionist or security guard\nassumes the package is authorized for release. The social engineer either\nshows up himself or has a messenger service pick up the package.\n\nPOLICIES FOR THE INCIDENT REPORTING GROUP\nEvery company should set up a centralized group that should be notified\nwhen any form of attack on corporate security is identified. What follows\nare some guidelines for setting up and structuring the activities of this\ngroup.\n20-1 Incident reporting group\nPolicy: An individual or group must be designated and employees should\nbe instructed to report security incidents to them. All employees should be\nprovided with the contact information for the group.\nExplanation/Notes: Employees must understand how to identify a security\nthreat, and be trained to report any threat to a specific incident reporting\ngroup. It is also important that an organization establish specific\nprocedures and authority for such a group to act when a threat is reported.\n20-2 Attacks in progress\nPolicy: Whenever the incident reporting group has received reports of an\nongoing social engineering attack they shall immediately initiate\nprocedures for alerting all employees assigned to the targeted groups.\nExplanation/Notes: The incident reporting group or responsible manager\nshould also make a determination about whether to send a company wide\nalert. Once the responsible person or group has a good faith belief that an\nattack may be in progress, mitigation of damage must be made a priority\nby notifying company personnel to be on their guard.\nSecurity at a Glance\nThe lists and charts reference version of following provide quick social\nengineering methods discussed in Chapters 2 to 14, and verification\nprocedures detailed in Chapter 16. Modify this information for your\norganization, and make it available for employees to refer to when an\ninformation security question arises.",
    "question": "What are the key policies and procedures that companies should implement to protect their employees and sensitive information from social engineering attacks?",
    "summary": "Human resources policies focus on protecting employees and the company from former employees and hackers by promptly removing them from directories, disabling access, and restricting the release of personal information. Physical security policies aim to prevent unauthorized access by controlling visitor identification, escorting visitors, and securing areas like the mail room and trash bins. Receptionist policies emphasize training to recognize and stop social engineers, such as by limiting directory access and verifying requests before relaying information."

    "text": "FROM KEVIN MITNICK\nTrue friendship has been defined as one mind in two bodies; not many\npeople in anyone’s life can be called a true friend. Jack Biello was a\nloving and caring person who spoke out against the extraordinary\nmistreatment I endured at the hands of unethical journalists and\noverzealous government prosecutors. He was a key voice in the Free\nKevin movement and a writer who had an extraordinary talent for writing\ncompelling articles exposing the information that the government doesn’t\nwant you to know. Jack was always there to fearlessly speak out on my\nbehalf and to work together with me preparing speeches and articles, and,\nat one point, represented me as a media liaison.\nThis book is therefore dedicated with love to my dearest friend Jack\nBiello, whose recent death from cancer just as we finished the manuscript\nhas left me feeling a great sense of loss and sadness.\nThis book would not have been possible without the love and support of\nmy family. My mother, Shelly Jaffe, and my grandmother, Reba\nVartanian, have given me unconditional love and support throughout my\nlife. I am so fortunate to have been raised by such a loving and dedicated\nmother, who I also consider my best friend. My grandmother has been\nlike a second morn to me, providing me with the same nurturing and love\nthat only a mother could give. As caring and compassionate people,\nthey’ve taught me the principles of caring about others and lending a\nhelping hand to the less fortunate. And o, by imitating the pattern of\ngiving and caring, I in a sense follow the paths of their lives. I hope they’ll\nforgive me for putting them in second place during the process of writing\nthis book, passing up chances to see them with the excuse of work and\ndeadlines to meet. This book would not have been possible without their\ncontinued love and support that I’ll forever hold close to my heart.\nHow I wish my dad, Alan Mitnick, and my brother, Adam Mitnick, would\nhave lived long enough to break open a bottle of champagne with me on\nthe day this book first appears in a bookstore. As a salesman and business\nowner, my father taught me many of the finer things that I will never\nforget. During the last months of my Dad’s life I was fortunate enough to\nbe able to be at his side to comfort him the best I could, but it was a very\npainful experience from which I still have not recovered.\nMy aunt Chickie Leventhal will always have a special place in my heart;\nalthough she was disappointed with some of the stupid mistakes I’ve\nmade, nevertheless she was always there for me, offering her love and\nsupport. During my intense devotion to writing this book, I sacrificed\nmany opportunities to join her, my cousin, Mitch Leventhal, and her\nboyfriend, Dr. Robert Berkowitz, for our weekly Shabbat celebration.\nI must also give my warmest thanks to my mother’s boyfriend, Steven\nKnittle, who was there to fill in for me and provide my mother with love\nand support.\nMy dad’s brother clearly deserves much praise; one could say I inherited\nmy craft of social engineering from Uncle Mitchell, who knew how to\nmanipulate the world and its people in ways that I never even hope to\nunderstand, much less master. Lucky for him, he never had my passion\nfor computing technology during the years he used his charming\npersonality to influence anyone he desired. He will always hold the title of\nthe grand-master social engineer.\nAnd as I write these acknowledgements, I realize I have so many people\nto thank and to express appreciation to for offering their love, friendship,\nand support. I cannot begin to remember the names of all the kind and\ngenerous people that I’ve met in recent years, but suffice it to say I would\nneed a computer to store them all. There have been so many people from\nall over the world who have written to me with words of encouragement,\npraise, and support. These words have meant a great deal to me,\nespecially during the times I needed it most.\nI’m especially thankful to all my supporters who stood by me and spent\ntheir valuable time and energy getting the word out to anyone who would\nlisten, voicing their concern and objection over my unfair treatment and\nthe hyperbole created by those who sought to profit from the \"The Myth\nof Kevin Mitnick.\"\nI have had the extraordinary fortune of being teamed up with best-selling\nauthor Bill Simon, and we worked diligently together despite our different\nwork patterns. Bill is highly organized, rises early, and works in a\ndeliberate and well-planned style. I’m grateful that Bill was kind enough\nto accommodate my late-night work schedule. My dedication to this\nproject\nand long working hours kept me up well into the early morning that\nconflicted with Bill’s regular working schedule.\nNot only was I lucky to be teamed with someone who could transform\nmy ideas into sentences worthy of a sophisticated reader, but also Bill is\n(mostly) a very patient man who put up with my programmer’s style of\nfocusing on the details. Indeed we made it happen. Still, I want to\napologize\nto Bill in these acknowledgments that I will always regret being the\none, because of my orientation to accuracy and detail, who caused him to\nbe late for a deadline for the first and only time in his long writing career.\nHe has a writer’s pride that I have finally come to understand and share;\nwe hope to do other books together.\nThe delight of being at the Simon home in Rancho Santa Fe to work\nand to be pampered by Bill’s wife, Arynne, could be considered a\nhighlight\nof this writing project. Arynne’s conversation and cooking will battle in\nmy memory for first place. She is a lady of quality and wisdom, full of\nfun,\nwho has created a home of warmth and beauty. And I’ll never drink a diet\nsoda again without hearing Arynne’s voice in the back of my mind\nadmonishing me on the dangers of Aspartame,\nStacey Kirkland means a great deal to me. She has dedicated many hours\nof her time assisting me on the Macintosh to design the charts and\ngraphics\nthat helped give visual authority to my ideas. I admire her wonderful\nqualities; she is truly a loving and compassionate person who deserves\nonly\nthe good things in life. She gave me encouragement as a caring friend and\nis someone who I care deeply about. I wish to thank her for all her loving\nsupport, and for being there for me whenever I needed it.\nAlex Kasper, Nexspace, is not only my best friend, but also a business\npartner and colleague. Together we hosted a popular Internet talk radio\nshow known as \"The Darkside of the Internet\" on KFI AM 640 in Los\nAngeles under the skillful guidance of Program Director David G. Hall.\nAlex graciously provided his invaluable assistance and advice to this book\nproject. His influence has always been positive and helpful with a kind\nness and generosity that often extended far beyond midnight. Alex and I\nrecently completed a film/video to help businesses train their people on\npreventing social engineering attacks.\nPaul Dryman, Informed Decision, is a family friend and beyond. This\nhighly respected and trusted private investigator helped me to understand\ntrends and processes of conducting background investigations. Paul’s\nknowledge and experience helped me address the personnel security\nissues\ndescribed in Part 4 of this book.\nOne of my best friends, Candi Layman, has consistently offered me sup\nport and love. She is truly a wonderful person who deserves the best out\nof life. During the tragic days of my life, Candi always offered\nencouragement\nand friendship. I am fortunate to have met such a wonderful,\ncaring, and compassionate human being, and want to thank her for being\nthere for me.\nSurely my first royalty check will go to my cellular phone company for\nall the time I spent talking with Erin Finn. Without a doubt, Erin is like\nmy soul mate. We are alike in so many ways it’s scary. We both have a\nlove\nfor technology, the same tastes in food, music, and movies. AT&T\nWireless is definitely losing money for giving me all the \"flee nights and\nweekend\" calls to her home in Chicago. At least I am not using the Kevin\nMitnick plan anymore. Her enthusiasm and belief in this book boosted\nmy spirits. How lucky I am to have her as a friend.\nI’m eager to thank those people who represent my professional career\nand are dedicated in extraordinary ways. My speaking engagements are\nmanaged by Amy Gray (an honest and caring person who I admire and\nadore) David Fugate, of Waterside Productions, is a book agent who went\nto bat for me on many occasions before and after the book contract was\nsigned; and Los Angeles attorney Gregory Vinson, who was on my\ndefense\nteam during my years-long battle with the government. I’m sure he can\nrelate to Bill’s understanding and patience for my close attention to detail;\nhe has had the same experience working with me on legal briefs he has\nwritten on my behalf.\nI have had too many experiences with lawyers but I am eager to have a\nplace to express my thanks for the lawyers who, during the years of my\nnegative interactions with the criminal justice system, stepped up and\noffered to help me when I was in desperate need. From kind words to\ndeep\ninvolvement with my case, I met many who don’t at all fit the stereotype\nof the self-centered attorney. I have come to respect, admire, and\nappreciate\nthe kindness and generosity of spirit given to me so freely by so many.\nThey each deserve to be acknowledged with a paragraph of favorable\nwords; I will at least mention them all by name, for every one of them\nlives\nin my heart surrounded by appreciation: Greg Aclin, Bob Carmen, John\nDusenbury, Sherman Ellison, Omar Figueroa, Carolyn Hagin, Rob Hale,\nAlvin Michaelson, Ralph Peretz, Vicki Podberesky, Donald C. Randolph,\nDave Roberts, Alan Rubin, Steven Sadowski, Tony Serra, Richard\nSherman, Skip Slates, Karen Smith, Richard Steingard, the Honorable\nRobert Talcott, Barry Tarlow, John Yzurdiaga, and Gregory Vinson.\nI very much appreciate the opportunity that John Wiley & Sons has\ngiven me to author this book, and for their confidence in a first-time\nauthor. I wish to thank the following Wiley people who made this dream\npossible: Ellen Gerstein, Bob Ipsen, Carol Long (my editor and fashion\ndesigner), and Nancy Stevenson.\nOther family members, personal friends, business associates who have\ngiven me advice and support, and have reached out in many ways, are\nimportant to recognize and acknowledge. They are: J. J. Abrams, David\nAgger, Bob Arkow, Stephen Barnes, Dr. Robert Berkowitz, Dale\nCoddington, Eric Corley, Delin Cormeny, Ed Cummings, Art Davis,\nMichelle Delio, Sam Downing, John Draper, Paul Dryman, Nick Duva,\nRoy Eskapa, Alex Fielding, Lisa Flores, Brock Frank, Steve Gibson, Jerry\nGreenblatt, Greg Grunberg, Bill Handle, David G.

I firmly believe that putting the public’s interest ahead of one’s\nown and dedicating your life to public service is something that deserves\nrespect, and while I’ve been arrogant at times, I want all of you\nto know that I love this country, and will do everything in my power to\nhelp make it the safest place in the world, which is precisely one of the\nreasons why I’ve written this book.",
