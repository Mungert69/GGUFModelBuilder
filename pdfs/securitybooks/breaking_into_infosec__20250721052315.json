Introduction\nThanks for spending a few quid on this book, I hope you enjoy it. This has been some amount\nof months in the making and a large amount of my free time has been poured into this. The\nbook is aimed primarily at those of you who are interested in breaking into the information\nsecurity industry. It is also suitable for anyone who has even the faintest interest in information\ntechnology/security. The main theory behind it being that it should serve as an aid for newbies\nlookingforresourcesandinformationonsecurity&hacking.Itdoesnotcontainthebeallandend\nallofknowledge,forsomeconceptsyouwillneedtodosomegooglingifyouwanttolearnmore.\nNote:Ifyou’veboughtaphysicalcopy&wouldlikeadigitalcopy,pleaseDMmeonTwitter1.\nWhat this Book is\nThebookitselfisacombinationofpostontopicsfrommyblog2 &otheradditionaltopics.Thefact\nthat you’re this far says you’ve either taken the time to purchase this (Thank You) or a friend has\nsentyouacopy.Ifyoufallintothesecondgroup,wellpiracyisathingshameonyou!\nThecoretopicsinthisbookareavailableforfreeonmyblogunderlearningtheropes101series,if\nyou can’t afford a few quid. However, some topics are not on my blog and exist solely within this\nbook for your reading pleasure.

For two reasons mainly. The first of which was for my blog to serve\nas an online repository of personal notes which I could refer back to at any point (how selfish of\nme!). Soon, this became a helping hand for others which is the second reason I continue to write\nposts.Ibelievethebestformoflearningisifyoucanexplainatopictoawiderangeofothers,you\nwilllearnmoreaboutthatyourself.\n1https://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n2https://blog.zsec.uk\n1. Introduction 2\nAnother reason why this book exists is it was suggested and requested by several of my followers\non Twitter3, who voiced a suggestion of making an on-the-go resource for beginners to refer to. It\nalso happens to exist because of a fellow hacker, friend and author who inspired me to write more;\nPeter Yaworski4. He has written a great eBook5 about web hacking 101 which holds a collection of\nbug bounty reports and tips. His book is solely based upon bug bounty reports and findings within\ndifferent programs however is a very interesting read and I would recommend you check it out if\nbugbountiesaresomethingthatyou’dliketogetinto.\nWho Is This Book for?\nIt is aimed primarily at folks who are starting out wanting to specialise in information security. If\nyou’ve even looked at very basic IT/development you may find some of this interesting to read. It\nismainly written for the individual who is looking to getinto penetration testing/bug bounties but\nisnotsurewheretostartorwhattoreadfirst.\nA Word of Warning\nWarning:Thisbookmaycontainnuts…\nSeriously though, this book is purely my opinion on topics required to give you a solid footing to\nbreakyourwayintotheinformationsecurityindustry.\nBefore diving into the super technical bits and bobs, it is important for anyone who is wanting to\nlearn the ropes to understand it is all on you. It is up to you to self-learn/self-teach, if you lack the\nmotivationtolearnyou’renotgoingtogetfarinthesecuritysector.\nThis book will not guarantee land you a job in InfoSec either, nor will it give you magic powers,\nmakeyouamillionaireorimmortal…\nDisclaimer\nAll the information in this book is published for general information purpose only.

I have aimed to provide only\nethical links but sites can change their content at any time. If you find a link that is inappropriate\npleaseletmeknowanditwillberemoved.\nIN SHORT- “HACKING IS ILLEGAL” please use common sense. The difference between hacking\nand ethical hacking/penetration testing usually boils down to “permission” do not try things on\n3https://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n4https://twitter.com/yaworsk\n5https://leanpub.com/web-hacking-101\nFollowmeonTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n1.

Permission from a site on a bug bounty platform comes in the form of the scope, if you\nshyawayfromthisyoucangetyourselfintrouble.\nPrerequisites\nThere are no real requirements to start reading this book except possibly being able to read(you\ncouldgetsomeonetoreadittoyouthoughsothatisn’tagamestopper).Someoftheexampleswill\nrequireyoutohaveacomputertorunthingson,nowyoumayalreadybetheresonottoworry!If\nnot, it’s not a core requirement but can help you understand things to a fuller extent.

CoreFundamentals 5\nThese five services can be used to access the server (in order of appearance) over FTP(File Trans-\nfer Protocol), SSH(Secure Shell), HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer\nProtocolSecure)andRDP(RemoteDesktopProtocol).\nBasic Networking\nHow Does the Internet Work?\nThis section will explain at a high level how the basics of the internet works and what is required\ntosimplybrowsetoawebsite,theprocessinvolvedandtheunderlyingtechnology.\nTCP/IP & DNS\nTCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. It’s the Internet’s fundamental\n“controlsystem”andit’sreallytwosystemsinone.Inthecomputerworld,a“protocol”issimplya\nstandard way of doing things—a tried and trusted method that everybody follows to ensure things\ngetdoneproperly.SowhatdoTCPandIPactuallydo?\nInternetProtocol(IP)issimplytheInternet’saddressingsystem.AllthemachinesontheInternet—\nyours, mine, and everyone else’s—are identified by an Internet Protocol (IP) address that takes the\nform of a series of digits separated by dots or colons. If all the machines have numeric addresses,\neverymachineknowsexactlyhow(andwhere)tocontacteveryothermachine.\nWhenitcomestowebsites,weusuallyrefertothembyeasy-to-remembernames(likehttps://blog.zsec.uk)\nrather than their actual IP addresses—and there’s a relatively simple system called DNS (Domain\nName System) that enables a computer to look up the IP address for any given website. In the\noriginalversionofIP,knownasIPv4,addressesconsistedoffoursetsofdigits,suchas12.34.56.78\nor123.255.212.55,buttherapidgrowthinInternetusemeantthatallpossibleaddresseswereused\nupbyJanuary2011.\nThispromptedtheintroductionofa“new”IPsystemwithmoreaddresses,whichisknownasIPv6,\nwhereeachaddressismuchlongerandlookssomethinglikethis:123a:b716:7291:0da2:912c:0321:0ffe:1da2.\nHowever, IPv6 has been around for a while it’s still not fully integrated as a normality, many\nbusinesseshaveitsetupforsites,butitisnotasmainstreamasIPv4.\nThe other part of the control system, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), sorts out how packets\nof data move back and forth between one computer (in other words, one IP address) and another.\nIt’s TCP that figures out how to get the data from the source to the destination, arranging for it to\nbebrokenintopackets,transmitted,resentiftheygetlost,andreassembledintothecorrectorderat\ntheotherend.\nFollowmeonTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n2.

Think of it like building a shed in your house and setting it\nuplikeanotherhouseorlivingenvironment.\nWhat it is Used For\nVirtualisation is all about separating traditional IT resources into more easily managed and\ncentralised solutions. This separation often increases scalability, improves resource utilisation, and\nreducesadministrativeresources.\nSpecifically, it works by utilising hardware to create a virtual environment similar to that of a\nphysicalmachine,takinganexampleasyouhaveadesktopthathasaquadcoreprocessor,4GBof\nram&a500GBHarddrive.\nIn the conventional way you could install windows on this and roll with a single operating system\nhowever say you need to do something in Linux or another OS, you could dual boot systems but\nthequickerwaytodosowouldbetovirtualise.\nSetting Up Your First Virtual Machine\nForthissectionyou’llneedtodownloadeitherVMWareplayerORVirtualBox,bothworkjustthe\nsame.MypersonalpreferenceisVMWareWorkstation(paidforversion)asithassomeneatfeatures\nsuchasexportandsnapshotsplusotherlittletweakshereandthere.\nNote: I’m going to show you how to setup on windows, however to do so on Mac & Linux is more\norlessthesamewithbothVMWare&Virtualbox.\n4.

Programming\nIn security it can be very useful to understand programming, whilst you might not be able to code\nstraightawayitisveryveryusefultounderstandthecorefundamentals.\nThroughout my blog and this book, I am hoping to give you the basics to prepare you to start your\njourneyinlearningthedifferentpathsofsecurity&hacking.\nThis section will cover off logic, programming basics, the differences between language types and\nsometipsonstartingpointsincoding.\nTostartwithI’mgoingtoexplainbasiclogicthroughtheuseoftruthtables.Nowsomeofyoumay\nnotknowthefirstthingaboutlogicandmayhaveneverevenheardofwhatatruthtableis,however\ndonotworryitwillallbeclearsoon.\nLogic\nLogicistheunderstandingofwhethersomethingistrueorfalse,howitworksanywhyit’scorrect\nor incorrect. Outside of programming one will deal with logic on a daily basis sometimes without\nevenrealising.\nTo start with I’m going to explain basic logic through the use of truth tables. A truth table is a\nmathematicaltableusedinlogic.Thisistheideaofone(1)beingtrueandzero(0)beingfalsewhich\nisalsoknownasonandoff.\nVery basic logic has three main logic gates: and, or, not. Each serves as an operator in a logic\nstatement,thethreesectionsexplainwhateachdoesandhowitworks.\nAnd\nAtaverybasicleveltheandlogicoperatorworkswithonevalueANDanotherequalthethird,there\narefourpossibleoutcomeswiththis.Theseareexplainedbelow:\nValue Value2 Equals\n0 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n1 1 1\nEssentiallybothvaluesneedtobeTruefortheendresulttobeTrue.Thisisusefulinprogramming\n5. Programming 17\nifastatementorfunctionisbeingmadewheretwoargumentsneedtobepresentbeforecontinuing.\nThink for example if you write a program that prints out someone’s name and age. The inputs are\nboth required in order to print out the result, the following example pseudo code shows this in the\nformofanif,elseloop.\n1 If name & address are true:\n2 print \"My name is\" + $NAME + \"and I am\" + $AGE \"years old...\"\n3 else:\n4 print \"Error, name AND age values required\"\nIf you don’t follow, essentially it is saying if value x & value y are present like the bottom line of\nthe truth table above then print out the statement “My name is bob and I am 18 years old...”\nwhere $NAME is Bob and $AGE is 18 otherwise print the statement “Error, name AND age values\nrequired”tothescreen.\nOr\nSimilar to the and operator, OR also requires a minimum of two inputs for it to produce an output.\nThe difference being with OR is that it does not require both values to be true for the end result to\nbetrue,thefollowingtabledemonstratesthispoint:\nValue Value2 Equals\n0 0 0\n0 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\nAs can be clearly seen as long as there is a True value (1) in the equation the resulting output will\nbetrue,onlywhenbothvaluesarefalsewilltheendresultbefalse.\nNot\nThenotoperatorworksinadifferentwaytoandandorasitonlyhastwopossibleoutcomes,1&0\nortrue&false.Essentiallyifonevalueispresentedasaninputtheoutputwillbetheinverseofit.\nInput Output\n0 1\n1 0\nLogic operators are used a lot in different programming languages, the main example of this in\nsecurity being related to web applications and database queries such as SQL (Structured Query\nFollowmeonTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n5.

A variable is a value within a program that can change, depending on\nconditions or on information passed to the program. A variable usually holds information that is\nusedlaterintheprogramorreferredtoforotheractions.\nUsually,a programor applicationconsists of a list of instructions that tell the computer what to do\nanddatathattheapplicationuseswhenitisrunning.Thedataconsistsofconstantsorfixedvalues\nthat never change and variable values (which are usually initialized to “0” or another default value\nbecausetheactualvalueswillbesuppliedbyaprogram’suser).\nTypically, both constants, and variables are defined as certain data types. Each data type limits the\nform of the data. Examples of data types include: an integer expressed as a decimal number or a\nstring of characters, usually limited in length. There are many different data types across all of the\nlanguages available however as a standard typically strings and integers are available at the very\nleast.\nFunctions\nAfunctionisapieceofcodeusuallywhichutilisesvariousservicesoractionsthatcanbeusedover\nand over again by calling the piece of code. An example of this might be if I set a function named\npow() and each time pow is run it prints out the letters x,y & z. This might look like something\nsimilartothefunctionbelow:\nFollowmeonTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n5. Programming 19\n1 function pow()\n2 {\n3 print \"x,y & z\"\n4 }\n5\n6 pow\nThe code above sets up the function pow() and whenever pow is referenced after that function, the\napplicationprintsout“x,y & z”totheterminal.\nIn many programming languages there is access to a compiler which contains a set of pre-made\nfunctionsthataprogrammercanspecifybywritinglanguagestatements.Theseprovidedfunctions\naresometimesreferredtoaslibraryroutines.Somefunctionsareself-sufficientandcanreturnresults\nto the requesting program without help. Other functions need to make requests of the operating\nsysteminordertoperformtheirwork.Essentiallyfunctionsareveryimportantwhenwritingcode\nastheysaveyoutime.\nLanguage Types\nWhen dealing in security you’re most likely to come across two different types of programming\nlanguage; compiled & scripting.

It also touches on some things to look for and some general tips & tricks. It\nwill mainly cover off the general topic however this can be applied to both penetration testing and\nbugbountyhunting.\nFor most of the people reading this, this may well be your first time looking at web applications\nfromahackingperspective.Togetstarteditsworthexplainingmyopiniononwhatwebapptesting\nisand howit can aidapplication developersin making appsmoresecure.Thisarea notonly serves\nas an introduction to the basics it also aims to give a mini overall guide on how to approach, setup\nandtestwebapps.\nWhat Defines a Web Application?\nTherearemanyaspectsthatfallintothecategoryhoweverthisisjustahighleveldescription.Asa\nbasicoutline,awebapplicationisanythingaccessedviaawebbrowserwithoutneedingadditional\ninteraction such as flash, java, Silverlight etc. This can be expanded to explain the likes of static\nsites,thickclients&webservices.\nWhat is Web Application Testing?\nNowwehavearoughoutlineastowhatqualifiesasawebapplication.It’stimetoexplain(briefly)\nwhatImeanbytestingwhenIrefertowebapplication(webapp)testing.Tospinitlightly,webapp\ntesting is the art and methodology of working through an application with an intent of identifying\nmisconfigurations,vulnerabilitiesandgeneralbugs.Atahighlevelitisessentiallylookingforways\ntohacktheapplicationtomakeitdothingsit’snotmeantto!\nWhy Web Apps Vs Infrastructure?\nPersonallyIdon’tmindeitherhoweverIfeelhavingtheskillsettotestandassesswebapplications\nwill stand you in better stead to enter the industry than that of someone with just infrastructure\nexperience.

WebApplicationTesting 39\nTooling\nItisnowtimetomoveontothetooling.Notingthatthisisfortestingandnotspecificallybugbounty\nhunting.Thetoolingandtechniquesareslightlydifferent.\nThe art of web testing is made up of many different areas, the traditional thought process would\npoint directly to web applications however this can vary on a very wide scale. The sub-headings\nbelowexplainsomeofthetoolingthatcanbeusedforeachstageoftesting.\nBrowsers\nGenerally, the most common browsers for pentesting are Firefox & Chrome as these tend to be the\nmostwidelyusedby<s>consumers</s>victims.PersonallyItendtouseFirefoxformostapplications\nandchromeformoreheavyapplicationsthatrequiretheuseofJava,SilverlightorFlash(heathen!).\nBothhaveagreatselectionofpluginsandadd-ons.TheseareafewI’dsuggestyoucheckout:\n• FoxyProxy74 {forchromeandFirefox}:Goodforquicklyswitchinglocalproxyifchannelling\ntrafficthroughaproxysuchasBurpSuite75 theinterfaceiseasytouseandeasytosetup.\n• Wappanalyzer76 {for chrome and Firefox}: Very useful add-on for quickly identifying the\ntechnologies used by the application or any frameworks in user.

The dev tools on Firefox as an add-on are\ngreat as there are many options including show all the JavaScript or other files on a single\npageincludingwhat’sbeingloadedandwhere.\n• Hackbar78: Again another Firefox only tool, personally I don’t use this as I feel it crowds too\nmuch of the screen and most of it’s functionality can be achieved by using a local proxy\nhoweverfeltIshouldincludeitanywayasI’veseenafairfewfolksusingit.\nThere are many other add-ons and extensions out there however the four described above are the\nmost commonly used. Additionally, there are specific browsers that have been created for testing\nspecificallyOWASPMantra79 isworthmentioning.\nIt is a fork of Firefox but with tonnes of plugins and add-ons built in.

WebApplicationTesting 40\nProxies\nOnce you have a browser setup how you like it, usually the next natural step is to setup a proxy to\nintercepttraffic,manipulateitandlookatspecificswithinanapp.\nThe industry standard for this job is generally burp suite, as mentioned above. It comes in two\nflavours, free and pro. The free version feeds the basic needs of most as, it acts as a transparent\nproxyallowingmodificationoftrafficandmanipulationofrequests/data.\nThe pro version however holds its own too, if you’re working professionally as a pentester you\ncannotgowrongwithBurp.Itisatoolthatshouldbeineverywebapplicationtester’sarsenal.\nThe benefit of using a proxy over testing ‘blind’ is that you can trap any request, play with it then\npass it on to the application. By doing this you will find that a lot of issues pop out straight away\nsuch as client side filtering that isn’t honoured server side or hidden values that are submitted in\nPOST requests that contain juicy information. The list is endless as to why its a great tool and a\ngreatpieceofkittohave.\nThere are other options out there too though, OWASP ZAP80 & Fiddler81 are other options if burp\nisn’tforyou.Bothofthesearefree!\nMy Setup\nGiven all the tools of the trade I personally have a somewhat common setup to most, I use several\ntoolsinmydaytodaytesting.\nTesting Browser\nThebrowserItendtogravitatetowardsisFirefoxwithFoxyProxy,Wappanalyzerandthedevtools\nconfigured.Configuredwithburp’scertificateforpass-through.\nProxy Choice\nBurpsuiteproismyweaponofchoicewhenitcomestopentesting&forbugbountiesI’llgenerally\nuseacomboofBurp&Fiddler.\nBurp Suite Features & Usage\nIn this section I will discuss the different features of burp suite, how to use them and how they are\nuseful.Iwillalsodiscusssomeadvancedtipsfortheproversion.Alsonotethatsomeofthetabsare\nonlyavailableintheproversion.\n80https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project\n81http://www.telerik.com/fiddler\nFollowmeonTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n7. WebApplicationTesting 41\nWhat is Burp Suite?\nBurp Suite (burp82) is a web application testing tool designed by Portswigger83. Currently it is the\nindustrystandardforwebapplicationpenetrationtesting.Itisalsowidelyusedbymanyindividuals\nwho partake in bug bounty hunting.

However, like all of the other tools within the suite it can be tuned to work better.\nBydefault,theoptionsforitareprettygoodbutwithtuningitcanbegreat!\nPairing Intruder with Scanner\nOnlyavailableintheproversion\nTo tune the scanner there is a little known trick that will allow you to pinpoint scanning. This can\nbe achieved by trapping a request that has parameters you want to scan then, right clicking on it\nandsendingittointruder.\nOnce the request is in intruder manually select the areas in which you want to scan then select\nActively scan insertion points.Thiswill sendthe scanneroff againstonly thepoints inwhich\nyou’veselectedinsteadofrandomlyscanningpointsintheapp/target.\nThiscanbeveryusefulforpinpointingvulnerabilitiesinapplicationsthatwouldotherwisebemissed\npotentially.\nFollowmeonTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n7. WebApplicationTesting 43\nRepeater\nThe repeater tool is arguably the most useful and powerfulsection within the burp suite tool set. It\nallowsrequeststobepassedtoitandmodifiedthenresenttotheserver.DuringatestIwillspenda\nlotoftimeinhereplayingwithrequestsandmodifyingdifferentparameterstoseetheirresponses.\nSpecifically,ithastwomainuses,thefirstofwhichallowsfreemanipulationofrequests.Allowing\nyoutotargetspecificparametersandfunctionswithinanapplication.Thesecondwhilenotafeature\norpossiblynottheintendeduse,itcanbeusedasaclipboard/archiveorinterestingrequestsforyou\ntogobacktolookat.\nImagine you’re looking at an application which shows signs of processing certain characters\ndifferently, you can right click and send this to repeater to look at later. Having the request in\nrepeaterwillallowyoutomanipulateitatalatertime.\nIntruder\nThe intruder tool has many many functions, however in this post I am only going to discuss a few\nofthese.Mainlyitcanbeusedforfuzzing,errorchecking&brute-forcing.\nIn order to utilise intruder, select an interesting request either from the proxy intercept or another\nyou’ve previously saved in repeater. Right click and selectsend to intruder. When the request is\nwithinintruderselectthepositionstabtoselectyourinputs.\nThe payload positions are up to you to set, however burp will auto-select what it thinks are\nparameters, you can clear this using the clear button, then select your own ones by selecting\nthe parameter then choosing add §. There are four attack types available to use in intruder, the\nsubsectionsbelowexplainwhateachdoes.\nSniper\nThe sniper attack takes one wordlist as an input and iterates over each parameter, one at a time. If\nyouhavemultipleinsertionpoints,itwillenumeratethefirstparameterwithallthepayloadsfrom\nthewordlistsuppliedandmoveontothenextandsoon.Itisbestusedwhenyou’rewantingtofuzz\neithersingleormultipleparameterswiththesamewordlist.\nBattering Ram\nLikethesniperattack,thebatteringramusesasinglewordlisthoweveritwilliterateovermultiple\nparameterswiththesamepayloadforalltheparameters.Thiscanbeusefulwhenyou’relookingat\nhowdifferentparametersreacttocertainpayloads.\nPitchfork\nThepitchforkattacktyperunsthroughmultipleparametersatthesametimeusingdifferentpayloads\nfor each parameter. This takes a single or multiple wordlists but will iterate through the words in\nthelistsplitacrossselectedparameters.Anexampleofthisisshown:\nFollowmeonTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n7. WebApplicationTesting 44\n1 1st request - id=wordlist1[1]&param2=wordlist2[1]\n2 2nd request - id=wordlist1[2]&param2=wordlist2[2]\nCluster Bomb\nThe cluster bomb attack type will take multiple wordlists and is useful when you have multiple\nparameters. It will run through over multiple parameters by using all the possible combinations of\npayloads from the multiple wordlists. So if you have multiple parameters, it will enumerate over\noneoftheparameterswithallthepayloadsfromitsrespectivewordlist,whiletheotherparameters\nhavethefirstpayloadfromtheirrespectivewordlistsloaded.\nThis can be very useful for when you are brute-forcing logins or other parameters/forms requiring\ntwoormoreinputs.\nBrute Forcing Basic Authentication\nA scenario where intruder can be very useful is when it comes to brute-forcing a HTTP basic\nauthentication login mechanism. In order to do this, first you must issue a base request with any\nvaluesastheusernameandpassword,sendthistointruder.I’veincludedanexamplebelow.\n1 GET /admin HTTP/1.1\n2 Host: localhost\n3 User-Agent: Firefox\n4 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\n5 Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5\n6 Connection: close\n7 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\n8 Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=\nNotice the bottom header Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4= this is the login value of\nadmin:admin in base64. In order to attack this, we’re going to use some of burp’s more advanced\nintrudersettings.\nMainly the custom iterator function, which allows you to split payloads up by a certain character\nor set of characters of your choosing. In this example I’ll be demonstrating a brute-force using a\nwordlist,whichinotherwordsisadictionaryattackasopposedtoapurebrute-forceattack.\nUsing a custom iterator allows you to generate your own custom payload string consisting from\nseveral substrings. For each substring you can specify what the separator is which is basically a\nsuffix.TheIntrudercallsthesesubstrings“positions”.\nSetting up the attack, the first thing to do is select the base64 string in the Authorization: Basic\nheader and change the attack type to sniper. Next go to the Payload tab and select the Custom\niteratoroptionfromPayload typemenu.\nFollowmeonTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n7. WebApplicationTesting 45\nNext select position 1 from the Position menu and load your usernames list in this . Put a colon\n(:)intheSeparatorforposition 1textbox.\nThen change the position to 2 then in position 2, load the values you want to use for password\nguessing, just as you did for position 1. After you’ve set your two positions you need to tell the\nIntruder to encode the payload string using Base64 encoding. To do this go to Payload processing\nsectionandclickAddbutton.SelectPayloadencodingoptionandthenBase64.\nBy default, burp intruder will URL encode select characters, I recommend that you remove the =\nsymbolasitisusedbybase64forpaddingandthiscanintroduceissueslateron.\nWhenthisisdonesimplyselectstartattack,burpwillnowrunthroughtheusernamesandpasswords\nyou’veprovided.\nDecoder\nAs with all of the tools within burp suite, each has a useful function. The decoder tool is all in the\nname,itdecodesaselecttypeofcharactersetsandencodingtypes:\n• PlainText\n• URLEncoding\n• HTML\n• Base64\n• ASCIIHex\n• Hex\n• Octal\n• Binary\n• Gzip\nEachofwhichcanalsobeencodedintousingthedecodertool.Thisisparticularlyusefulforwhen\nyouencounterparametersanddatawithinrequestswhichisencoded.Bydefault,burpwillattempt\nto auto detect the encoding however you can manually select which type of encoding to decode as\ntoo. Decoder can also be used to take checksums of strings, using a variety of hashing functions,\nthesearelocatedinthehashdrop-downmenu.\nSequencer\nThe sequencer tool has many functions but its main use is for checking the entropy of tokens and\ncookies. It is accessible by sending requests to it that can then be replayed in the 100s or 1000s to\nchecktherandomnessofcreatedvalues.Thiscanbeveryusefulfortestingtherandomnessofcookie\norCSRFtokengeneration,mainlyausewhentestingauthenticationandauthorizationbutcanalso\nbeusedfortestingUUIDandGUIDvaluestoo.\nFollowmeonTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ZephrFish\n7.

What this means for\nthe consultant is that there will be sections within the report that will need to be tailored for each\naudience.\nIn a nutshell, usually you don’t want to be dropping acronyms left right and centre like XSS,\nCSRF, and other buzzwords to management.

    "question": "What are some effective ways for hackers and security professionals to develop their social and people skills?",
    "summary": "Social and people skills are essential for becoming a successful penetration tester or consultant, even if you have strong technical abilities. Meeting people in real life, through events like meetups and conferences, helps build these skills and opens up networking opportunities. Attending conferences and meetups, such as DEF CON or OWASP groups, allows you to connect with others in the security community and enhance your ability to communicate and collaborate effectively."

Penetration Testing vs Bug Bounty\nHunting\nThis section will discuss the differences between choosing penetration testing as a career path vs\ndoingbugbounties.Itwillalsocoverofftheprosandconsofbothtoo.\nAs many of you will know I have experience in both, while doing penetration testing as a day job\nI do enjoy partaking in bug bounty hunting in my free time. I find they pair of nicely against each\notherlendingnewskillstoeach.\nThere is an ongoing discussion I’m seeing again and again surrounding if bug bounties can replace\ntraditionalpentests,inmyopinionIwouldn’tsaytheycanreplacethemhoweverinsomecasescan\ngohandinhandwiththem.\nA bug bounty platform/program is more suited to the external network and perimeter than it is to\naninternalnetworkhoweverthisrealitymightchangeinthecomingyears,whoamItopredictthe\nfuture!\nPenetration Testing\nThevastmajorityoffolksreadingthisbook,youraspirationswillbetolandajobforaconsultancy\nas a pentester. Do you know what it takes to learn the art and what is required though? So far in\nthis book I’ve covered off the basic technical and general skillsets that are required, however what\nisdaytodaylikeforapentester?\nGenerally speaking, as a penetration tester (have a giggle, go on it is a funny title) will vary\ndepending on who you are working for, what region you’re working in and what area your team\ncovers. Takingthe UK as anexample(whereI’m from),most testers will be widely skilled in many\nareasinthefieldwithacoreknowledgebaseinwebapplicationtesting&infrastructuretesting.\nHowever, this base isn’t the only type of testing or work that a tester will undertake, typically this\nwill also encompass wireless testing, configuration reviews, thick client reviews, phishing, social\nengineering & some other more bespoke areas such as hardware hacking & embedded system\nbreakouts.\nInawayyoucouldcalltheUKmarketprettymaturewhenitcomestotestersbasedupontheskillsets\nheld by a vast majority, note that these skillsets will be gained overtime and that you likely won’t\nbeexpectedtoknowaboutthemallfromtheoffsodon’tworryifyou’reajuniorstartingout.\nBycontrasttestersintheUStendtobefocusedmoreononeareaoranotherwithveryfewdelivering\nthe vast degree of services.

Alongside the hacking, the main product that your client is\npayingforisthereportasitisthefinaldeliverable.\nBug Bounty Hunting\nNow the other legal route for someone learning about penetration testing techniques and hacking\nwill be bug bounties. Like penetration testing bug bounties have a similar area of skillsets whereby\nanindividualcanpicktheirtargetsandchoosewhatskillstohonein.\nMy personal view on it (and this is my opinion) is that for many it is a full time job but I feel it\nis not as sustainable as a career doing pentesting, sure you’ll probably earn more in the short term\nhowever doing pentesting in most situations will net you a salary in which you’ll get paid at the\nendofthemonthregardless.\nItishoweverafantasticopportunitytodoandevenifyouworkasapentesterbyday,partakingin\nbugbountiesinyoureveningswillserveyouwellasitexposesyoutodifferentsystems,techniques\nandgenerally(unlessyou’reredteamingallthetime)moreopenscopes.\nTheyallowyoutohoneinonareasinwhichyouhavethemostinterestandtrytoperfectdifferent\ntechniques whilst still being able to report back your findings to the specific vendors.

The two things I would recommend that you\ndoare:\n• 1)Createablog154\n• 2) Keep it up to date with projects you’re doing, write-ups & tutorials(all optional of course,\nhoweverwillstandyouingoodstead).\nBy creating a blog you are doing two things essentially, you’re creating a log of the projects you\ndo outside of your studies or in your spare time and what you’re also doing is demonstrating your\nabilitytowritethingsdown.\nAdvertising Skillset\nTypicallythefirstengagementyou’llhavewithapotentialemployeriseitherfacetofaceatanevent\nor by sending your CV out to them. If it is the first my advice would be, just be careful what you\nsaytopeopleandhowyouapproachdifferentsituationshoweverthat’sjustgenerallifeadvice!\nWhen it comes to CVs though, the best thing you can do is write it yourself, especially if you’re\napplying for a role in infosec that involves reporting.

This can depend on where\nyou’re applying for i.e are you applying to a massive corporation who will likely filter based on\ncertifications or are you applying to a small outfit who are more likely to read your CV despite\ncerts?\nEither way you want to hit the ground running with a one to two page highlight of how awesome\nyou are and why you’re the person they need! In your introduction blurb you want to tailor this\nto the audience, so for a corporation you might want to start out by explaining you have x,y &\nz certifications and are active in x community or have done y as a profession for z years etc. An\nexampleblurbmaylooksimilarto:\nAndy has worked in information security for just under 4 years combined, focussed\nspecifically on penetration testing, having achieved >OSCP & Crest Registered Tester\n(CRT), He is a CHECK Team member (CTM) and has delivered several CHECK tests.\nAndyiscurrentlyworking>towardsCrestCertifiedTester(CCT-Inf)andCHECKTeam\nLeader (CTL) status.

    "question": "What are the key differences between a career in penetration testing and bug bounty hunting, and how do they complement each other?",
    "summary": "Penetration testing and bug bounty hunting are both paths in cybersecurity, but they differ in focus and approach. Penetration testing is typically a full-time job with a broad skill set, while bug bounty hunting is often a side activity that allows for more flexibility and exposure to various systems. Both have their own advantages and challenges, and the choice depends on individual goals and preferences. To succeed in either path, it's important to build a strong portfolio, maintain an up-to-date blog, and be honest about your skills and experience."
