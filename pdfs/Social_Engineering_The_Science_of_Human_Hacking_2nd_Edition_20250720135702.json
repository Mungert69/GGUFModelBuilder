    "text": "FOREWORD\nWhen I started Apple Computers in 1976 with Steve Jobs, I did not imagine where that invention\nwould take the world. I wanted to do something that was unheard of: create a personal computer.\nOne that any person could use, enjoy, and benefit from. Jump forward only a short 40 or so years\nand that vision is a reality.\nWith billions of personal computers around the globe, smartphones, smart devices, and technology\nbeing embedded into every aspect of our lives, it is important to take a step back and look at how we\nmaintain safety and security while still innovating and growing and working with the next\ngeneration.\nI love getting to work with youth today, inspiring them to innovate and grow. I love seeing the ideas\nflow from them as they figure out new and creative ways to use technology. And I truly love being\nable to see how this technology can enhance people's lives.\nWith that said, we need to take a serious look at how we secure this future. In 2004 when I gave the\nkeynote speech at HOPE Conference, I said that a lot of hacking is playing with other people and\ngetting them to do strange things. My friend, Kevin Mitnick, has mastered this over the years in one\narea of security called social engineering.\nChris’s book captures the very essence of social engineering, defining and shaping it for all of us to\nunderstand. He has rewritten the book on it again, defining the core principles of how we as humans\nmake decisions and how those very same processes can be manipulated.\nHacking has been around for a while, and human hacking has been around for as long as humans\nhave. This book can prepare you, protect you, and educate you how to recognize, defend, and\nmitigate the risks that come from social engineering.\n—Steve “Woz” Wozniak\n7\nPREFACE\nSocial engineering—I can remember when searching for that term led you to videos on getting free\nburgers or dates with girls. Now it seems like it's almost a household term. Just the other day I\nheard a friend of the family, who's not in this industry at all, talking about an email scam. She said,\n“Well, that's just a great example of social engineering!”\nIt threw me for a loop for a second, but here we are, eight years after my decision to start a company\nsolely focused on social engineering, and now it's a full-blown industry and household term.\nIf you were to just start reading this book it would be easy to mistake my intentions. You might think\nI am fully okay with arming the bad guys or preparing them for nefarious acts. That cannot be\nfurther from the truth.\nWhen I wrote my first book, there were many folks who, during interviews, got very upset with me\nand said I was arming the malicious social engineers. I felt the same then as I do now: you cannot\nreally defend against social engineering until you know all sides of its use. Social engineering is a\ntool like a hammer, shovel, knife, or even a gun. Each has a purpose that can be used to build, save,\nfeed, or survive; each tool also can be used to maim, kill, destroy, and ruin. For you to understand\nhow to use social engineering to build, feed, survive, or save, you need to understand both uses. This\nis especially true if your goal is to defend. Defending yourself and others from malicious uses of\nsocial engineering requires that you step over into the dark side of it to get a clear picture of how it is\nused.\nI was recently chatting with AJ Cook about her work on Criminal Minds, and she mentioned that\nshe often has to meet with real federal agents who work serial-killer cases to prepare herself for\nplaying the role of JJ on the show. The same idea applies directly to this book.\nAs you read this book, do it with an open mind. I tried my hardest to put the knowledge, experience,\nand practical wisdom I have learned over the last decade onto these pages. There will always be\nsome mistakes or something you don't like or something you might feel was not 100% clear. Let's\ndiscuss it; reach out to me and let's talk. You can find me on Twitter: @humanhacker. Or you can\nemail me from one of the websites: www.social-engineer.org or www.social-engineer.com.\nWhen I teach my five-day courses, I always ask the students to not treat me like some infallible\ninstructor. If they have knowledge, thoughts, or even feelings that contradict something I say, I want\nto discuss it with them. I love learning and expanding my understanding on these topics. I extend\nthe same request to you.\nFinally, I want to thank you. Thank you for spending some of your valuable time with me in the\npages of this book. Thank you for helping me improve over the years. Thank you for all your\nfeedback, ideas, critiques, and advice.\nI truly hope you enjoy this book.\n—Christopher Hadnagy\n8\n1\nA Look into the New World of Professional Social Engineering\nI suppose your security is your success, and your key to success is your fine palate.\n—GORDON RAMSAY\nI still vividly remember sitting in front of my computer screen as I started to pen the first paragraph\nof Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking. It was way back in 2010. I am half tempted to\ntell you we had to write books uphill both ways back then, using a typewriter, but I don't want to get\ntoo dramatic.\nIn that time, when you searched the Internet for “social engineering,” you got a few pages on social\nengineering legend Kevin Mitnick and some videos on how to pick up girls or get free burgers from\nMcDonald's. Fast-forward eight years, and now the term social engineering is used almost as a\nhousehold term. In the past three or four years, I have seen social engineering in security,\ngovernment, education, psychology, military, and every other application you can imagine.\nThis transition begs the question of why. One colleague told me, “It's your fault, Chris.” I think he\nmeant it as an insult, although I felt a tinge of pride at that statement. However, I don't feel that I'm\nsolely responsible for the near ubiquity of the term social engineering (SE). I believe that we see it\nbeing used by everyone and their brother now because it is not only the easiest attack vector—as it\nwas seven years ago—but because it's now also meriting the largest payloads for attackers.\nThe cost to set up an SE attack is low. The risk is even lower. And the potential payout is huge. My\nteam has been collecting stories in the news about SE attacks and scouring the web for statistics. I\nfeel comfortable stating that in 2017, more than 80% of all breaches had a social engineering\nelement to them.\nThe IBM “2017 Cost of Data Breach Study” states that the average cost of a breach was 3.62 million\nUS$. When the potential for a payout is that large, it's certainly not hard to see why an attacker\nwould want to use social engineering.\nPRO TIP\nAs of 2017, the IBM “Cost of Data Breach Study” had been produced for 12 years.\nYou can find it at https://www-03.ibm.com/security/data-breach/. Or you can simply\nenter “Cost of Data Breach Study” in any search engine to find and download a\nfull and current report.\nI also remember one of my first interviews after my Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking\nbook was published in 2010, when I was asked, “Aren't you worried that you are arming the bad\nguys?” But to me, SE is like any new type of warfare.\nTo help me more clearly explain this, I think about the story of Bruce Lee arriving in America in the\n1960s. Racial prejudice was high, and he was doing something that no one else was doing: teaching\nJeet Kune Do (an ancient Chinese martial art) to people of any race, color, or nation. He was battling\nin the university he went to with fellow students who felt they knew a lot about fighting. But he laid\nout flat opponent after opponent. Eventually, some of those opponents even became Bruce's friends\nor students.\nWhat is the lesson? People had to adapt to a new type of fighting, or they would just constantly get\nbeat. Was there a risk that a student of Bruce Lee could use his newfound skills to hurt other people\nand do evil? Yes, but Bruce felt it was necessary to educate people, so they could remain protected.\nSo, my answer to the question, “Aren't you worried that you are arming the bad guys?” is the same\nas it was eight years ago: I cannot control how you use this information. You can read this book and\ngo out and attack people and steal their money. Or you can read this book and learn to be a defender\nfor what is right. The choice is yours, but the good guys need someone to help teach them.\n9",

    "text": "Learning to defend against this new style of attack takes more than just learning how to take a\nbeating. Like Jeet Kune Do, it requires a balance of learning how to attack, learning how to defend,\nand knowing when to do each. As you learn how to be a social engineer, you need to be able to think\nlike the bad guys while remembering you are the good guy. To steal another analogy, you need to be\nstrong with the force but not walk over to the dark side.\nNow you might be asking, “If not much has changed in your response, then why do we need a\nsecond edition of your book?” Well, let me tell you.\nWhat Has Changed?\nThis is a fundamental question when it comes to social engineering. On the surface, the answer is,\n“Not much.” You can go back a long way and find anecdotes about social engineering. For example,\none of the first documented stories I can find is in the Bible, in the book of Genesis, and it reportedly\nhappened around 1800 BCE. Jacob wanted the blessing that was to be given to his older brother\nEsau. Knowing his father, Isaac, had failing eyesight and relied on other senses to know who he was\nspeaking to, Jacob dressed in Esau's clothing and prepared food like Esau would have prepared.\nHere's the best part: Esau was known to be extraordinarily hairy, but Jacob wasn't, so he fastened\nthe skins of two young goats to his arms and the back of his neck. When Isaac reached out to touch\nJacob, Isaac relied on his senses of smell, touch, and taste to tell him that he was with Esau rather\nthan Jacob. According to the account in Genesis, Jacob's social engineering attack worked!\nFrom the dawn of recorded history, we see one account after another of humans tricking, duping,\nconning, or scamming one another. On the surface, there might not be much that's brand new when\nit comes to social engineering, but that doesn't mean that nothing ever changes.\nOne example is vishing. I honestly remember using the word vishing for the first time. People\nlooked at me like I was speaking Klingon. Seriously, I might as well have said laH yIlo' ghogh HablI'\nHIv (you Trekkies will appreciate that). As of 2015, though, vishing was added to Oxford English\nDictionary.\nPRO TIP\nKlingon is a fictional language, but there is an actual institute (www.kli.org)\ndevoted to teaching, translating, and speaking Klingon. You also can find\nnumerous translators online. To date, I have not heard a story of anyone “social\nengineering” any other person in Klingon.\nWhy is it important that vishing is now in the dictionary? It goes to show how much social\nengineering vectors have affected the world. Words that once appeared to be part of a “made up”\nlanguage now are part of our everyday vocabulary.\nIt's not just the vocabulary that's become commonplace. Now there are services that specialize in\nhelping the bad guys be better at being bad. For example, while I was doing work for a client, I\nstumbled upon a service that specialized in proofreading and spellchecking malicious phishing\nemails. That company provided 24/7 English-speaking support. Blend stuff like that with our BYOD\n(bring your own device) culture and the fact that most mobile devices are mini supercomputers, and\nthen stir in some new-world social media addiction. What you're left with is a recipe for a whole new\nattack landscape—social engineer style.\nIn addition to the landscape changing, I have changed. When I wrote the first edition of this book,\nthe title was Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking. I chose that name because I felt that\nwhat I was describing in that book was much like art. Art is subjective; it means different things to\ndifferent people. It can be applied differently and can be used, viewed, liked, and hated for\ncompletely different reasons.\nThis second edition is called Social Engineering: The Science of Human Hacking. The Merriam-\nWebster dictionary gives one definition of science as, “The state of knowing: knowledge as\ndistinguished from ignorance or misunderstanding.” Eight years ago, much of what I did was new to\nthe security realm, and I was learning as I went. Now I am in a “state of knowing” due to the\n10\nadditional years of experience on my resume.\nThat experience, I hope, will make this book much more meaningful to you, whether you're a\nsecurity expert who's looking to understand social engineering, an enthusiast who's looking to\nbroaden your horizons, or an educator who's looking to understand problems to include in your\nlessons. No matter why you are reading this book, my hope is that by thinking of these topics on a\nmore scientific level, I can relay this information in a much more useful and complete manner.\nWhy Should You Read This Book?\nI feel that this first chapter needs to follow the same pattern I took in my first book, so I want to\nspend a little time discussing why I feel that anyone should read this book. Yes, I realize I might be\nbiased here, but humor me for a moment.\nAre you a human? I am going to guess that if you are sitting in front of this book, reading this\nparagraph, you are either some advanced form of AI or you're human. I'll even go so far as to say\nthat 99.9999999% of this book's audience is human. Social engineering takes the way humans are\nwired to make decisions and exploits the vulnerabilities in those processes.\nThe goal of the social engineer is to get you to make a decision without thinking. The more you\nthink, the more likely you are to realize you are being manipulated, which of course is bad for the\nattacker. In episodes 7 and 70 of The Social-Engineer Podcast, I had the privilege of interviewing\nDr. Ellen Langer. She spoke to me about something she called alpha and beta mode.\nSEPODCAST REFERENCE\nFollowing are the URLs where you can find the episodes of The Social-Engineer\nPodcast during which I interviewed Dr. Langer:\nEpisode 7 includes my first interview with Dr. Langer, in which we discuss her\nresearch and her books: www.social-engineer.org/podcast/episode-007-using-\npersuasion-on-the-mindless-masses/\nEpisode 70 takes place five years after my first interview with Dr. Langer. She\ncame back on the show to tell us what she had learned over the years, what had\nchanged, and how we have advanced: www.social-engineer.org/podcast/ep-070-\nthinking-with-out-a-box/\nAlpha mode is when one's brain is running at 8 to 13 cps (cycles per second). It is generally\ncharacterized by “daydreaming,” or what Dr. Langer called “relaxed, focused concentration.”\nBeta mode is when one's brain runs anywhere from 14 to 100 cps. This is when our brains are alert,\nobservant, and aware of the things going on around us.\nWhich state benefits a social engineer more? Obviously, the answer is alpha mode because thinking\nand awareness are lessened. This is not just the case when it comes to malicious intentions.\nManipulation and some types of influence are geared toward getting you to act without thought.\nFor example, you most likely have seen a commercial like this: A famous female musical artist\ncomes on the screen, and a very sad song is playing in the background. The image changes to scenes\nof kittens and puppies that have been beaten, hurt, and underfed. The animals are filthy and dirty,\nand they look like they're at death's door. Now the artist comes back on screen; she's surrounded by\nhealthy animals, and she's showering them with love. What's the message? For only a few dollars,\nthose malnourished, near-dead animals can be transformed into loving pets—healthy, happy, and all\nyours. The images in the commercial are like what you see in Figure 1-1.\n11\nFigure 1-1 How does this make you feel?\nIMAGE CREDIT TO AMAZON COMMUNITY ANIMAL RESCUE, www.flickr.com/photos/amazoncares/2345707195\nAre the producers of the commercial manipulating you for selfish means? Not entirely. What they\nhave learned is that if they trigger your emotions, there is a greater likelihood that you will donate or\ntake the desired action. The success rate is much greater than if they just appeal to knowledge or\nlogic. The more emotions are triggered, the less you think rationally. The less you think rationally,\nthe quicker you will decide based solely on the emotions triggered.\nSo, back to my earlier point: If you are human, then this book can help you understand what types of\nattacks exist. You can learn how the bad guys are using your humanity against you, and you can\nlearn how to defend against these attacks to protect your loved ones from being victims.\nLet me start by giving you an overview of social engineering.\nAn Overview of Social Engineering\nWhenever I discuss social engineering, I usually start with a definition that I have been using for the\nlast 10 years. I've modified it only slightly over time.\nBut before I give you that definition of social engineering, I need to state one very important point:\nsocial engineering (SE) is not politically correct. This truth can be hard for many people to swallow,\nbut it's real: SE takes advantage of the fact that gender bias, racial bias, age bias, and status bias (as\nwell as combinations of those biases) exist.\nFor instance, imagine you have to infiltrate a client's building. To do so, you need to develop a\npretext that allows you to gain entry easily. Your team is made up of a few different types of folks. If\nyou determine that the best pretext for the job is janitorial staff, which of the following team\nmembers would be the best fit?\n40-year-old white, blonde male\n43-year-old Asian female\n27-year-old Latino female\nIf you determine that your best pretext is intercompany kitchen work, which of the following team\nmembers would be the best fit?\n40-year-old white, blonde male\n12\n43-year-old Asian female\n27-year-old Latino female\nThe fact is, a skilled social engineer in any of the categories can make a go of it and succeed. But\nwhich one will lead to the least amount of thinking? Remember, thinking is the enemy of the social\nengineer.\nWith that in mind, let's get back to how I define social engineering:\nSocial engineering is any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be\nin his or her best interests.\nWhy is my definition so broad and general? It's because I believe that social engineering isn't\nalways negative.\nThere was a time when you could say, “I'm a hacker,” without causing normal people to run for\ncover, unplugging every electronic device in their path. Being a hacker used to mean someone who\nneeded to know how something worked. A hacker wasn't satisfied with just base knowledge; that\nperson wanted to dig deep into the inner workings of anything. Then, once it was understood, a\nhacker would see if there was any way to bypass, enhance, exploit, or alter its original purpose.\nWhen I started my first book, I wanted to try to make sure that I could define social engineering in a\nway that didn't always imply that it involved a terrible scam artist or conman or grifter. The very\nsame principles that I see the bad guys use can be applied for good purposes, and I want people to\nknow that.\nI often use this illustration: If you came up to me and said, “Hey, Chris. I want to have a princess tea\nparty with you—you sit here, and I will paint your nails while you wear a pink scarf and we talk\nabout Disney princesses,” I would not only laugh at you, but I would slowly back away while looking\nfor the nearest exit. Yet, I must admit that there may be some pictures floating around of this type of\nevent.\nHow so? My daughter asked me to have a princess tea party with her. Now, before you say, “Hey,\nthat's an unfair comparison—you love her!” I'll admit, that had a lot to do with my decision to join\nher, but think about the psychological principles that were at play for me to make that decision. To\nagree to a decision that I would literally refuse in a nanosecond had anyone else asked me, I had to\nbypass my normal decision-making in order to say “Yes.”\nUSELESS FACT\nConsidering a nanosecond is one billionth of a second, and the average person\nspeaks at a rate of 145 words per minute, I literally could not “say” the word no in\na nanosecond. On the other hand, light, which travels at 186,000 miles per\nsecond, can travel 1 foot in a nanosecond.\nWhen you understand how decisions are made, you can start to understand how a malicious\nattacker can use emotional triggers, psychological principles, and application of the art and science\nof social engineering to get you to “take an action that is not in your best interests.”\nDr. Paul Zak appeared in The Social-Engineer Podcast episode 44. He wrote the book The Moral\nMolecule (Dutton, 2012). In that book and in our podcast, Dr. Zak spoke about his research into a\nhormone called oxytocin. His research helped us to see how closely it is linked with trust because he\nmade one very important comment about how oxytocin is released into our blood when we feel that\nsomeone trusts us. Please understand this very vital point: your brain releases oxytocin not just\nwhen you trust someone, but also when you feel that someone else has given you trust. According to\nDr. Zak's research, this phenomenon has been demonstrated in person, over the phone, over the\nInternet, and even when you can't see the person who is doing the “trusting.”\nSEPODCAST REFERENCE\n13\nEpisode 44 of The Social-Engineer Podcast includes the fascinating conversation\nwith Dr. Zak about his life's work. You can find it at www.social-\nengineer.org/podcast/ep-044-do-you-trust-me/\nAnother chemical that our brains produce is dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter produced\nby the brain and released during moments of pleasure, happiness, and stimulation. Blend oxytocin\nwith dopamine, and you have a social engineering brain cocktail that can open any door you want.\nDopamine and oxytocin are released in our brains during intimate moments, but they also can be\nreleased during normal conversations. Those conversations are at the core of social engineering.\nI believe we use these same principles daily—many times, unknowingly—with our spouses, bosses,\nfellow workers, clergy, therapists, service people, and everyone else we meet. Consequently,\nunderstanding social engineering and how to communicate with your fellow human is imperative\nfor all people today.\nIn a world where technology has made it easy to communicate using emoticons or fewer than 280\ncharacters, it has become more difficult to learn how to use conversational skills, let alone see when\nthose skills are being used against us. Taking it one step further, social media has created a society\nwhere telling everyone everything about ourselves is acceptable, and even promoted.\nWhen I talk about social engineering from a malicious perspective, I break it down into the following\nfour vectors:\nSMiShing: Yes, this is a real thing, and it stands for SMS phishing, or phishing through text\nmessages. When Wells Fargo was breached in 2016, I received the SMiShing attack shown in\nFigure 1-2.\nFigure 1-2 This SMiShing attack trapped a lot of people.\nWhat's crazy is that I don't even use Wells Fargo, but I still received this attack. (And no, I am\nnot telling you what bank I use—nice try.)\nWith a simple click, these attacks were geared either to steal credentials or to load malware on\nthe mobile device and sometimes both.\nVishing: As I already mentioned, this is voice phishing. This has increased as a vector\ndrastically since 2016. It is easy, cheap, and very profitable for the attacker. It is also nearly\nimpossible to locate and then catch the attacker with spoofed numbers calling from outside the\ncountry.\nPhishing: The most talked about topic in the world of social engineering is phishing. In fact, the\ntechnical editor on this book, Michele, and I wrote about it in a book titled Phishing Dark\nWaters: The Offensive and Defensive Sides of Malicious Emails (Wiley, 2016). (Yes, I did just\nshamelessly plug one of my other books.) Phishing has been used to shut down manufacturing\nplants, hack the DNC, breach the White House as well as dozens of major corporations, and steal\ncountless millions of dollars in different scams. Phishing is by far the most dangerous of the four\nmain vectors.\nImpersonation: I know, we should put some form of 'ishing on this one too, but the best I\ncould do is list it last because it's different. However, its placement in this list by no means\nindicates that we don't have to worry about it as much as the others. In the past 12 months, we\nhave collected hundreds of stories of people impersonating police, federal agents, and fellow\nemployees committing some truly horrific crimes. In April 2017, there was a story of a man who\nwas impersonating the police and was caught. He was dealing in child pornography and using his\nimpersonation to profit.\n14\nMORE INFO\nAt the time of writing, that sickening story can be found on this site: www.sun-\nsentinel.com/local/broward/pembroke-pines/fl-sb-pines-man-child-porn-20170418-\nstory.html.\nEvery social engineering attack you read about can be broken down into one of these four categories.\nMore recently, we are seeing what we call the combo attack, where malicious social engineers are\nusing a combination of these in one attack to achieve their means.\nWhen I analyze these attacks, I start to see patterns that not only identify what kinds of tools and\nprocesses are used, but that can also help a security expert define more clearly how to perform these\nattacks and then use the results to educate and protect. I called this the SE pyramid.\nThe SE Pyramid\nLet me just jump straight into the pyramid before I define why I came up with this and what each\nsection means. The pyramid is illustrated in Figure 1-3.\nFigure 1-3 The SE Pyramid\nAs you can see, the pyramid is broken into a few sections, and approaches social engineering from\nthe perspective of an SE professional—that is, not one using SE for nefarious purposes but to help\nclients and customers.\nI'm going to define each section of the pyramid, and I'll get into the layers in more detail later in this\nbook.\nOSINT\nOSINT, or Open Source Intelligence, is the life blood of every social engineering engagement. It is\nalso the piece that should have the most time spent on it. Due to that, it occupies the first and largest\npiece of the pyramid. One piece of this part of the pyramid is rarely addressed: documentation. How\nwill you document, save, and catalog all the information you find? I discuss this key factor a bit more\n15\nin the next chapter.\nPretext Development\nBased on all the findings from the OSINT period, the next logical step is to start to develop your\npretexts. This is a crucial piece that's best done with OSINT in mind. During this phase, you see\nwhat changes or additions need to be made to ensure success. This is also when it becomes clear\nwhat props and/or tools are needed.\nAttack Plan\nHaving a pretext in hand does not mean you are ready. The next stage is to plan out the three W's:\nwhat, when, and who.\nWhat is the plan? What is it we are going for and trying to achieve? What does the client want?\nThese questions will help develop the next piece.\nWhen is the best time to launch the attack?\nWho needs to be available at a moment's notice for support or assistance?\nAttack Launch\nNow comes the fun part: launching the attacks. With the preparation done on the attack plan, you\nare prepared to go full steam ahead. It is important to be prepared but not to be so scripted that you\ncan't be dynamic. I am all for having a written plan, and I think it can save you a ton of headaches\ndown the road. The caution I have is that if you script out every word or action you feel needs to be\ntaken, you can run into problems when the unexpected happens. Your brain realizes there is nothing\non the script to help, and you begin to stutter, get nervous, and show signs of fear. This can really\nruin your ability to succeed. Instead of scripting, I suggest using an outline, which gives you a path\nto follow but allows for artistic freedom.\nReporting\nWait—don't skip over this section. Come back and read it. Yes, reporting is not fun, but you can\nthink of it this way: Your customer just paid you x dollars to perform some services, and most likely,\nyou were pretty darn successful in those attacks. But the customer didn't pay you just because they\nwanted to look cool. They paid you to understand what they can do to fix the problem. For that\nreason, the reporting phase is at the very tip of the pyramid, is the very pinnacle that the rest of the\npyramid rests on.\nThe five phases of this pyramid, if followed, will lead to your success not only as a social engineer,\nbut as a professional who is offering social engineering services to your customers. The fact is that,\nwith the exception of reporting, these steps are followed by the malicious social engineers in the\nworld.\nIn 2015, Dark Reading reported on an attack that involved this very pyramid. (You can read the\narticle “CareerBuilder Attack Sends Malware-Rigged Resumes to Businesses” at\nwww.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/careerbuilder-attack-sends-malware-\nrigged-resumes-to-businesses/d/d-id/1320236?.)\n1. The attackers investigated attacking a few targets and while working through their OSINT phase,\nthey found out that their targets used a popular site called CareerBuilder.\n2. After completing the OSINT phase, the attackers started on pretext development. This led them\nto plan a pretext as a job seeker, who was looking to get hired at whatever role their targets were\noffering. They realized the tools they needed would be some maliciously encoded files and some\nrealistic-looking resumes.\n3. They started to plan the attacks, by answering some of those W questions.\n4. They then launched the attacks by uploading their malicious documents not to the target but to\nthe CareerBuilder website. The companies that posted the jobs would be notified by email that\nthere was a new applicant, and that email would contain the attacker's uploaded attachments.\n5. They did not follow through with any actionable reporting phase, but there is some actionable\n16",

And that is exactly the goal of the malicious social engineer: to get the target to take an\naction that is not in their best interest without thinking through the potential dangers involved.\nWhat's in This Book?\nWhen I started to plan this book, I wanted to make sure that I kept to the outline of the first edition\nof Social Engineering so those who benefited from its pages would benefit from this book too. At the\nsame time, I wanted to change the book and update it to cover some of new attacks and things I\nnever discussed in the previous book.\nI wanted to make sure I took all the advice from fans, researchers, readers, and reviewers in the\nhopes that I could make this book much better than the first. Let me outline how this book is\nformatted so you know what to look forward to.\nFollowing the path of the pyramid, Chapter 2, “Do You See What I See?,” discusses OSINT and\ncovers some of the timeless techniques used. I refrain from delving into actual tools too much,\nalthough I mention a few that have stayed in my tool chest for the last decade.\nIn Chapter 3, “Profiling People Through Communication,” I examine a topic that I barely touched in\nthe first edition. I delve deep into advanced communication modeling and profiling tools.\nChapter 4, Becoming Anyone You Want,” is where I start to dive into pretexting. This is a topic that\nnot many people talk about outside of social engineering. I cover tips, tricks, and many of the\nexperiences (both successes and failures) that I have had over the years.\nIn Chapter 5, “I Know How to Make You Like Me,” I compile information from the many podcasts,\nnewsletters, and conversations with some of the world's greats—like Robin Dreeke—and apply the\nprinciples of rapport-building to social engineering. Robin Dreeke is the head of the FBI's\nBehavioral Analysis Unit and a good friend of mine. He is a master at building rapport and trust and\nhas defined the steps to do both.\nChapter 6, “Under the Influence,” applies the work of one of the leaders in the study of influence,\nRobert Cialdini, to the field of social engineering. The chapter takes the principles that he developed\nover his years of research and shows how they can and are being used by social engineers.\nChapter 7, “I Didn't Even Ask You for That,” defines framing and elicitation and outlines how\nanyone can master both.\nIn Chapter 8, “I Can See What You Didn't Say,” we return to one of my favorite topics: nonverbals. I\ndig super-deep into this topic in my book Unmasking the Social Engineer: The Human Element of\nSecurity (Wiley, 2014), but this chapter is a beginner's guide to get you started in the world of\nnonverbals.\nIn Chapter 9, “Hacking the Humans,” I take the previous eight chapters and apply them to five\ndifferent types of social engineering attacks. This chapter shows how important it is for you, as a\nprofessional social engineer, to apply the principles of this book.\nAs we near the end, Chapter 10, “Do You Have a M.A.P.P.?,” covers prevention and mitigation. In a\nbook about professional social engineering, it is fitting to have this chapter cover the four steps in\nlearning to fight all social engineering attacks.\nThen, like all good things, this book must conclude. So, Chapter 11, “Now What?,” brings this book\nto an end.\nHere are a few promises I have for you:\nI promise to not quote Wikipedia as a valued source, especially when mentioning research. (I\nlearned from my mistakes.)\nI promise to tell you many stories from my experiences during the last seven or more years.\nSometimes, I tell one story from many angles to help really get a few points solidly fixed for you.\nBut I try and mix up those stories so you don't get bored.\nWhen I am using the research or work of some of the greatest minds in their fields, I will make\nsure you have references to their work, so you can look deeper into any topic you may want.\n17\nJust as I did with the first book I ever wrote, I openly welcome all contacts, comments,\nsuggestions, and criticism.\nAll I ask in return is that you read this book in the light it was intended. If you are a novice, this book\ncan help you learn what is needed to be a professional social engineer. If you are experienced, then I\nhope my sharing a few stories, tips, and tricks will give you some new tools for your arsenal. If you\nare an enthusiast, then I want you to read this with the same excitement as I had while writing it.\nAnd if you are a skeptic, then read this with the thought that I am not claiming to be the one and\nonly messiah of SE. I'm just a passionate social engineer with many years of experience that I want\nto share to try and make this world a little bit safer.\nSummary\nNo book that I write would be complete without a cooking analogy, so here it goes. Like any great\nmeal, there is a lot of planning, a great recipe that calls for fresh ingredients, and then artistic and\nscientific execution. Social engineering, although simplistic in nature, is not a recipe for a novice. It\ninvolves understanding how humans make decisions, what motivates them, and how to control your\nown emotions while exploiting those same processes in others.\nThe topic of this book is still as relevant today as it was eight years ago—maybe even more so now.\nIn the past eight years, I have watched many people rise as professional social engineers. I have seen\nmany malicious social engineers rise and fall too.\nWith the nature of attacks leaning so heavily toward the human element, it is imperative that all\nsecurity professionals understand social engineering. But there is so much more to this topic. I\nremember when I started working as a chef (in a former life a long time ago), my mentor would take\ningredients and tell me to taste little bits of each. But why?\nHe told me that I couldn't possibly know what it means “to taste” if I didn't really understand what\neach item tasted like. If I know that the recipe calls for some horseradish, and I want it to be a little\nspicier, then I understand that I could add a little bit more. Understanding that a certain ingredient\nalso has a salty quality might make me adjust my salt for the recipe, so items are not overly\nseasoned. You get the point.\nEven if you are not in the security industry, it is important to understand how each of these\ningredients “tastes” so you can be protected. What does it mean to build rapport with someone, and\nhow can that be used to get you to part with your money? (This is covered in Chapter 5.) How does\ninfluence, when sprinkled in an elicitation conversation, make someone give up a password over the\nphone? (This is covered in Chapters 6 and 7.)\nEach of these ingredients can help you to learn the “taste.” When you know them, you can recognize\nwhen someone tries them out on you, and you are more secure. You can sense something isn't right,\nand you can take defensive actions.\nHave you ever watched any cooking competition with Gordon Ramsay? When he tastes a dish that\nhe hates, he identifies the specific problem: “This dish has way too much pepper and they used too\nmuch oil.” A novice, on the other hand, might say, “It's too spicy and greasy.” Are those two\ndescriptions the same thing? I think not. My goal is to help you become a Gordon Ramsay of the SE\nworld—but maybe with less foul language.\nWith that said, let's jump into the first meaty chapter and discuss OSINT.\n18\n2\nDo You See What I See?\nRemember that failure is an event, not a person.\n—ZIG ZIGLAR\nOSINT stands for Open Source Intelligence, and it's the life blood of social engineering. Information\nis the starting and supporting point of every engagement. Because OSINT is so important to us as\nsocial engineers, it is vital that you understand all the different ways you can go about obtaining\nintel on your targets.\nRegardless of how you obtain OSINT, you need to have a clear idea in mind of what you are looking\nfor. That might seem easy to do, but it's not as easy as it sounds. You can't simply say, “I want all\ninfo on the target.” Every type of information has a different value, and what is valuable can change\nwith the type of attack you are looking to launch.\nA Real-World Example of Collecting OSINT\nLet me try to give you some perspective. According to the site www.worldwidewebsize.com, there\nare more than 4.48 billion indexed websites. This doesn't count anything that's not indexed, sites on\nthe dark web or deep web, and so on. Annual worldwide Internet traffic reached 1.3 zettabytes (that\nis 1,300,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes). One source even tells us that the Internet can contain\nup to 10 yottabytes of total data. (Writing 10 yottabytes looks like this:\n10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.)\nFUN FACT\nThe yottabyte, which oddly enough comes after the zettabyte, was named after the\nStar Wars character Yoda. There are a few categories of numbers that are even\nlarger and more oddly named than this one—for example, shilentnobyte and\ndomegemegrottebyte.\nWhy is the amount of traffic on the Internet even remotely important to understand? Well, for\nexample, if you are looking to send a spear-phish, your goal might be to look for personal hobbies,\nlikes, dislikes, and things the target finds valuable. But if you are going to vish your target, then you\nmight want to find details about the target's job, what role the person plays in the work organization,\nand what kinds of internal and external resources that person would expect calls from. If your goal is\nto get onsite, then you need to know whether the target would meet with people and who those\npeople would be.\nYou have 4.48 billion potential websites to scrape through to look for data that can be helpful. So,\nbefore you start digging in, it is important to plan your OSINT engagement.\nTo help you establish some parameters for what you're looking for, use the lists of questions in Table\n2-1.\nTable 2-1 Sample OSINT questions\nType of Questions to Ask\nOrganization\nCorporation How does the corporation use the Internet?\nHow does the corporation use social media?\nDoes the corporation have policies in place for what its people can put on the\nInternet?\nHow many vendors does the corporation have?\n19\nWhat vendors does the corporation use?\nHow does the corporation accept payments?\nHow does the corporation issue payments?\nDoes the corporation have call centers?\nWhere are headquarters, call centers, or other branches located?\nDoes the corporation allow BYOD (bring your own device)?\nIs the corporation in one location or many locations?\nIs there an org chart available?\nIndividual What social media accounts does the person use?\nWhat hobbies does the person have?\nWhere does the person vacation?\nWhat are the person's favorite restaurants?\nWhat is the family history (sicknesses, businesses, and so on) of the person?\nWhat is the person's level of education? What did the person study?\nWhat is the person's job role, including whether people work from home, for\nthemselves, and who they report to?\nAre there any other sites that mention the person (maybe they give speeches, post\nto forums, or are part of a club)?\nDoes the person own a house? If yes, what are the property taxes, liens, and so\non?\nWhat are the names of the person's family members (as well as any of the\npreviously mentioned info on those people)?\nOf course, the questions in the table only touch the surface. You can add other items about types of\ncomputers used, employee schedules, what languages are used, type of antivirus protection used,\nand much more.\nHere's a story ripped from the 2017 headlines. (You can read one account of it at\nhttps://gizmodo.com/this-is-almost-certainly-james-comey-s-twitter-account-\n1793843641.) It is centered on former Director of the FBI James Comey. An Internet blogger and\nresearcher wanted to see if she could locate James Comey's social media accounts. Because Comey\nwas the director of the FBI, it wasn't public knowledge whether he had social media accounts, let\nalone how to locate them. That is where this OSINT story starts.\nThe full outline of the steps the blogger used to get to the bottom of the story is shown in Figure 2-1.\nTake a look, and then I'll walk you through it step by step.\nFigure 2-1 Amazing OSINT on a secure target\nFirst, the researcher had to establish what she wanted to uncover: Did Director Comey have social\nmedia accounts? If so, where were they?\nResearching this using only the Internet proved to be very hard. In 2016, one website listed “The\nTop 60 Social Media Platforms.” With that many platforms available—all with different rules and\nmethods—it can be very hard to find one man.\nFortunately, one of the oldest forms of OSINT proved to be in the researcher's favor: listening. In\n20\none public appearance, Director Comey mentioned that he had Twitter and Instagram accounts.\nThat statement helped the researcher narrow the search from more than 60 social media platforms\nto just two. Two is a much easier number to manage in a search.\nAfter not finding any accounts directly linked to Director Comey, the researcher located the Twitter\naccount for Brien Comey, the director's son. The researcher was able to confirm the connection of\nBrien Comey to Director Comey when Brien congratulated Director Comey for his ascension to\nDirector of the FBI.\nOne of the things a user can do is to link multiple social media accounts together. In this case, Brien\nhad linked his Instagram account to his Twitter account. The researcher checked the Instagram\naccount, but Brien had locked his account from the public, so only those who had been granted\npermission to the account could see what he posted.\nThe researcher decided to request to follow Brien. One of the features of Instagram is that while you\nwait for a user to accept your follow request, you're pointed to people in the same circle, in case you\nalso want to follow any of those people. Instagram suggested a bunch of users who were Brien's\nfamily members (not including Director Comey) and one account for reinholdniebuhr.\nIf you do a few Internet searches for “Reinhold Niebuhr,” you quickly learn that he was an American\ntheologian and political commentator. However, he died in 1971, so it's doubtful that he has an\nInstagram account. But with a little more investigation, the researcher learned that Comey wrote\nabout Reinhold Niebuhr in his college thesis.\nArmed with this information, the researcher searched Twitter and found seven accounts using that\nname. Out of all seven, there was one using that name publicly with the handle @ProjectExile7.\nWith a little more digging, the researcher found that Project Exile was the name of a program that\nComey started when he was a U.S. attorney living in Richmond.\nThe researcher made her discoveries without accessing anything illegal, without hacking one single\nthing, and by looking only at open-source intelligence sources as she thought through the clues.\nThis is an excellent example of blending both nontechnical and technical OSINT, and it's a good\nlesson for all social engineers. That's the basis of the rest of this chapter: the different types of\nOSINT and how to utilize them as a social engineer. I've broken it down into two main sections:\nNontechnical OSINT and Technical OSINT.\nTO DOCUMENT OR NOT TO DOCUMENT—THAT IS THE\nQUESTION\nBefore we dive straight into the types of OSINT, I want to have a little sidebar with\nmy thoughts on documentation.\nThe question is not really whether to document or not. The real questions are\nwhat do you use to document and how much do you document?\nThink about what I said at the very start of the chapter: When you are searching\nthrough 10 yottabytes of data, you will find a lot of info on your targets. No matter\nhow smart you are, unless you have a photographic memory, you won't be able to\nremember every detail. And even people with photographic memories cannot\ncomplete professional reporting by relying solely on their memories.\nNow, I can't really tell you exactly how you should document, because there are\ntoo many factors. For instance, when I started down this career path and it was\njust little ol' me doing all the work, I used advanced notepad applications that\nallowed me to make a new folder or note for each client. I would then break down\nthat note into different sections like Personal, Business, Family, Social Media,\nand so on. When I found a piece of OSINT, I would document it under the\nappropriate section, which made it easier to find that data as I was writing the\nreport. I used little tricks like using certain colors for things I used on attacks. I\nused one color for moderate and another for critical finds.\nThen my team started to grow, and I had many people working on one project,\n21\nwhich made me realize that passing notepads back and forth wasn't the best\nsolution at all. I had to come up with a solution that allowed the team members to\nshare notes.\nAt first, I considered things like Google Drive. I considered cloud-based note\napplications and other cloud-based tools.\nThose solutions presented a few problems:\nI was being tasked with obtaining Social Security numbers, banking data, and\nother private and personal details on people's lives. What if the solution I used\ngot hacked? (That happened in 2013 when Evernote was breached, and more\nthan 50 million passwords had to be changed.)\nI couldn't control the way those solutions were accessed or how the data was\nmanaged.\nThe word “cloud” often caused certain clients to shudder and say “No!”\nThat led me to start building out my own servers. We obtained space in a server-\nhosting facility that was vetted and secure. We built our own secure VPN server\nand installed the software we had chosen on a server we owned that was behind\nfirewalls, routers, and our VPN.\nThis meant I controlled how the data was stored, managed, backed up,\ntransmitted, and secured. This solution let me rest easy at night because I was\nconfident in the way we managed our clients' data.\nMaybe you have a different solution. The important thing is that you take\nseriously how you store, manage, back up, transmit, and secure any data you\ncollect on your clients.\nNontechnical OSINT\nI consider nontechnical OSINT to be anything that does not involve direct interaction between the\nsocial engineer and a computer. You might shoulder surf as a target uses a computer, but you (the\nSE) are not the one using the computer. It is information you gather using nontechnical means.\nThere are a lot of specific methods I could go through here, but I can loosely define them all as\nobservational skills, and in the following section, I give you some examples.\nObservational Skills\nObservational skills might seem like they're obvious and easy to use, but using them successfully is\nnot a common skill—especially in the age of the firehose of digital media. If anything, today's\nmarketing tactics have trained us to not pay attention to details. A 2015 study conducted by Emily\nDrago of Elon University (titled “The Effect of Technology on Face-to-Face Communication”) makes\nthe point that the quality of face-to-face communications has declined due to technology. Sixty-two\npercent of individuals observed for the study used a mobile device while in conversation with others,\ndespite knowing it would decrease the quality of that communication.\nNOTE\nTo read the full text of “The Effect of Technology on Face-to-Face\nCommunication,” visit www.elon.edu/docs/e-\nweb/academics/communications/research/vol6no1/02DragoEJSpring15.pdf.\nWe are in a society that largely conveys messages of 280 characters and emojis, communicating\nthrough memes or social media posts. The advances that make these things possible are amazing,\nbut they have created a situation in which people are less observant of those they are\ncommunicating with. It's also the reason that observational skills are at the top of my list in\n22\nnontechnical OSINT.\nYou might be asking a few questions, such as these:\nWhat does the term observational skills encompass?\nWhat can you do to teach yourself these skills?\nWhat should you expect to reap?\nLet's discuss each of these questions and see what you can observe and learn (see what I did there?).\nWhat Do Observational Skills Encompass?\nThe following scenarios give you some examples of how observational skills can be used in the real\nworld.\nScenario 1\nYour task is to gain entry to the mailroom of a large healthcare facility. You must do it in broad\ndaylight. You can't pick locks, climb walls, or jump through windows. You're testing the front desk\nand security staff to see if they'll allow you into the secured area, so you must go through the part of\nthe healthcare facility where those staff members work.\nHere are just a few things you should have in your OSINT arsenal of observational skills:\nClothing: This simple but sometimes overlooked piece of knowledge is important. In Chapter 1,\n“A Look into the New World of Professional Social Engineering,” I say the goal of the social\nengineer is to get you to decide without thinking. If you are breaking into a place where everyone\ndresses casually, and you're dressed in a three-piece suit, you're going to make people take notice\nof you. The reverse is also true, so you want to know how employees dress so that you can dress\nthat way, too.\nEntries and exits: Before you enter the building, understand where your egress points are. Is\nthere a door where the smokers hang out? Is one entrance more heavily guarded than another?\nAre there shift changes that leave a certain post unmanned, or less manned?\nRequirements for entry: What is required to gain entry to the facility or area? Do you see\nemployees with badges? What kind of badges? Where do they wear them? Do they have to also\nknow a code? Do visitors get escorts? Do visitors get badges? Is there a mantrap, turnstile,\nsecurity desk, or other security setup when you walk in?\nPerimeter security: Check out what's happening outside the building. Are there security\ncameras? Are there guards roaming the grounds? Are the dumpsters locked up? Are there any\nalarms or motion-triggered defense systems?\nSecurity staff: Are they busy looking at their mobile devices or a computer screen, or are they\nalert and paying attention? Do they look bored beyond belief or interested?\nLobby Setup: Are keypads or security devices set up where you can shoulder-surf for\npasswords? (In other words, can you get close enough to peek over someone's shoulder and\ncapture the password as it is being typed?)\nOf course, there can be many more things you will want to observe, but those are some of the basics.\nTo help you understand why these criteria are so important, here's a true story that involves\nclothing, entries and exits, requirements for entry, and perimeter security. Michele (who's the tech\neditor on this book) and I were tasked with the very scenario I outlined at the beginning of this\nsubsection. We had to do a fair amount of technical OSINT, which I get into later in this chapter, but\nthere was also a fair amount of nontechnical OSINT that led to our success.\nWe decided to use the pretext of a pest control company that was hired to quote out an emergency\nspider spraying. We called our company Big Blue Pest Control and came with full Big Blue outfits\nand spray bottles of custom blue “poison” to kill any spiders we saw during the quoting process. This\npoison was actually just some blue Gatorade in a spray bottle.\nFUN FACT\n23\nBlue Gatorade disguised as poison is a great way to carry a replenishing and\nrefreshing drink that can be used to quench your thirst when you're nervous\nabout breaking into a building and sweating profusely. However, if you are taking\ngulps from your “poison sprayer” in the elevator when someone comes in, you\nmight get weird looks.\nWe started by driving around the perimeter and noticing entrances, exits, camera locations,\nhangouts for the smokers, and entrances that seemed the most crowded versus least crowded. We\nalso took note of whether the employees coming in and out had badges and how they were dressed.\nWe then picked our initial ingress point and started to do a slow walk toward the door. The reason\nfor the slow walk was to observe what we could of how people were being let in.\nWe saw two security guards overseeing people as they pressed their badges against a metal stand\nand were allowed in. There was also a security desk to the right that had someone manning a sign-in\nsheet.\nWe decided to try to walk right past the guards and follow the crowd in. That did not work at all. We\nwere stopped by a security guard who asked us what we were doing and why we were there. I looked\ndown at his name badge and saw his name, and then I started to say, “Well Andrew, we were asked\nto come and give a proposal for some emergency spider spraying… .” The guard stopped me mid-\nsentence by saying, “Okay, go sign in at the desk.”\nI thought we were in, but as we approached the desk, the man there asked for our names. As we gave\nour fake names, he scoured a list. When he didn't find us on the list, he said, “Sorry, you are not on\nour visitor list for today. You cannot come in without authorization.”\nWe tried to explain, influence, and even use pressure and a plea for help. Nada. Shut down. We\nexited the front door, walked around as we discussed what we would do, and saw a few smokers\noutside taking a break. I told Michele to follow me, and we walked toward the smokers, acting as if\nwe belonged and were inspecting the outside of the building. I pretended to take notes on my\nclipboard.\nWe again did a slow walk, until we saw a few people moving toward the door, so we tailgated right in\nbehind them. Now in the building, we followed this mass of people, and I quickly noticed we were\nheading straight toward the front where the security guards who just rejected us were located. I saw\nan elevator to my right, but there were no buttons. “Darn,” I thought to myself, “an elevator that is\ncalled by security.” Just as I finished my thought, an elevator door opened, and I immediately\nstepped inside, hoping that Michele would observe and follow my lead.\nFortunately for me, Michele is pretty amazing at this type of thing and was not lost or overstressed.\nThere was a group of people in the elevator, and Michele promptly announced so all the people\ncould hear, “Boss, can we finish this job soon? I'm starving, and you said we can't eat 'til we're\ndone.”\nI got a disapproving look from a woman on the elevator who said, “Feed the poor woman.” I replied,\n“I want to, but we just have one more floor to inspect. The quicker we get done the quicker she can\neat.”\nThe woman sighed and said, “Well, then, let's get you where you are going… . ,” and I butted in\nmidsentence with “to the mailroom.” The woman pulled out her badge, swiped the receiver in the\nelevator, hit a few buttons, and said, “Let me drop you off on the way.”\nWhew! Thankfully, due to Michele's great observational skills and my quick movements, we had not\nbeen caught, and we even got a nice lady to badge us to that secure floor. (And Michele was only\npartially faking because, really, she is always hungry.)\nOn the floor with the mailroom, we got off the elevator and discovered that the mailroom door was\nlocked. There was a bell with a label that said, “Ring for assistance.” We rang it and waited.\nA woman came to the door and said, “How can I help you?” We spouted off our pretext about doing\na quote and so on. The woman replied, “Well, I am going to have to call the security desk to get this\napproved.”\nOur story would have been blown if she had called security, so I said, “Well, you can if you want, but\nAndrew is the one who sent us down here to get this done.”\nShe said, “Oh, Andrew sent you? Then come on in.” She let us into the mailroom and said, “Just\ndon't touch the mail.” We were rummaging through ceilings by moving the ceiling tiles, network\n24\ncable, and endless amounts of mail.\nAs you can see throughout this story, so much occurred because we made quick observations and\ncataloged that information for later use. (And this was just the beginning.)\nI didn't know I would need Andrew's name, Michele didn't know we were going to meet a\nsympathetic woman on the elevator, and neither of us knew we would meet a group of disinterested\nsmokers who didn't care that we tailgated in. But observations allowed us to use each of these for\nsuccess.\nScenario 2\nYou are tasked to spear-phish a high-profile lawyer from a major American corporation. You're\nallowed to use any information you can find on her.\nThis story will unfold more when we get to the technical OSINT section, but to pinpoint a very\nvaluable lesson, let me tell you how I failed miserably on this one.\nOur OSINT led us to the fact that the lawyer handled some matters in Massachusetts. We discovered\na recent tax law update in Massachusetts that might grab her interest and be very effective in getting\nher to click a link or open a malicious attachment.\nI began crafting an email about the changes in the state of Massachusetts and planned every aspect\nof this spear. The email was written professionally, did not threaten, included the payload we\nwanted, gave a realistic deadline for reading and replying, and gave just enough detail to make sure\nshe had to click to get more.\nWithin minutes of sending the email, we were caught and reported, and the campaign was totally\nblown. Did you pick out the flaw from the preceding paragraph? I will give you a few seconds to go\nback and look before I tell you.\nTime's up!\nMassachusetts is not a state but a commonwealth. This lawyer, whose attention to detail was her\nstrong suit, received an email about changes to the State of Massachusetts tax law and said to\nherself, “Hey, they should know Massachusetts is not a state but a commonwealth!” That caused her\nto look at the “From” address and the URL, and to become suspicious enough that she reported it.\nAnd our cover was blown.\nWe did not observe the little detail in this story, and that lack of observation cost us.\nThe lesson of this scenario is that you need to observe everything you can. Think like the person you\nare social engineering. Try to understand what they would expect to see, and deliver that. Otherwise,\nlittle details can come back to bite you.\nWhat Can You Do to Teach Yourself These Skills?\nThis topic is hard to cover in a short section in a book. Each person has natural ability as well as\nlearned ability that can make learning these skills really easy or very difficult. Because I don't know\nyou personally, all I can do here is tell you what I did to try and enhance my skills.\nI would play a game that was along the lines of Capture the Flag. If I was entering a building—let's\nsay a doctor's office—I would say to myself, “The flags are to remember the first two people I see,\nwhat color shirts they are wearing, and what magazine they are reading or what they are doing.”\nI would set some boundaries like these:\nThey can't be the service-related folks behind the counter.\nI had to still go about my task of checking in and couldn't pause or deviate from that.\nI couldn't write anything down.\nThen I would enter the building, observe what I saw, and try my hardest to remember it until I left\nthe building. It would go something like this:\nOlder woman sitting to left in blue shirt reading Woman's Day magazine\nYoung child, male, striped T-shirt, playing with blocks on the floor\nI would make a note of each of these things in my mind and try my hardest to remember them. I\nused little memory tricks, such as saying something to myself a couple times to try and embed it in\n25\nmy mind.\nWhen I felt that I could make mental notes like this without having to think too hard, I would add\nsome layers of complexity. Eventually, my flags list looked like this:\nGender of X number of people\nWhat they were wearing\nWhat activities the people were engaged in when I first sighted them\nPerceived communication profile (more on this in Chapter 3, “Profiling People Through\nCommunication”)\nBody-language tells\nFrom this, I would try to build a story in my head of why they were at the location I was at, and use\nthe details in the story to remember them.\nHonestly, this worked so well—even with my bad memory—that I can remember one office I walked\ninto three or four years ago where I saw two women in black skirts and white button-up tops reading\nsomething on an iPad. The woman on the left did not seem to like the woman on the right, but she\ntolerated her, or she had somewhere else to be. I could discern these things because the woman's\nhips were fully bladed away from the woman on the right.\nThere was a man behind a counter with a security suit on—black suit, white shirt, black tie. He had a\ngold watch on his right wrist, which indicated he was left-handed. His hair was neat, and he had a\nwell-trimmed beard. He was writing on a notepad with a pen. He was observant of me as well as the\nlobby.\nThere was a young man waiting in chairs in front of the counter. He was looking at a newspaper, but\nit appeared to me that he was faking reading. He was staring into space, and the edges of the paper\nwere shaking. I fabricated a story that he was there for an interview and was nervous but was trying\nto look calm and distract himself with a paper.\nIt is almost as if I can see that lobby now in my mind. These little observations go a long way toward\nhelping you achieve your goals as a social engineer. My suggestion is to look for your own\nweaknesses, and then start small and build up. It is important to really get the point that you must\npractice. Too often, I see people wanting to achieve something 100% right away, but it takes time.\nFailure can teach us way more than success if we let it—which is why I need to talk about\nexpectations.\nWhat Should You Expect to Reap?\nIn the book Unmasking the Social Engineer, which I coauthored with Dr. Paul Ekman, I focused\nsolely on nonverbal cues: body language and facial expressions. When I started learning how to first\nnotice and then decipher these expressions, I felt like some kind of mind-reading superhero. I could\nlook at a face and see emotions that the person was trying to hide, and then I blended that with body\nlanguage and other actions to almost predetermine how they would react to questions or situations.\nThe crazy part is that I found that my predictions were right more than 50% of the time. Therein\nbegan the problem. Let's say I was right 75% of the time. That means I was wrong 25%. In addition\nto that, it affected my perceived ability, and I felt that I could see more, understand more, and\ntherefore SE more than I really could.\nOne of my most humbling lessons came from working with Dr. Ekman, who has corrected me time\nand time again. He said, “Chris, just because you can see the what doesn't mean you know the why.”\nBefore I discuss expectations, I feel it's important for you to hear this repeatedly: Just because you\ncan see the what doesn't mean that you automatically know the why. How can you make that\nconnection between the what and the why? There are a few ways: questions, more information, and\nlonger observation.\nHere's an example: I was teaching a class, and I was talking about a social engineering story from\nmy experience. One student suddenly got an angry look on his face. His body language shifted from\nbeing open to closed. With arms folded, he leaned back in his chair and his legs jutted out. I\nperceived that he was not believing what I was saying, and I began to give him more personal\nattention. Doing so did not seem to fix his lack of belief, and he drew back. After a few minutes, he\nexcused himself and left the class.\n26\nI was dumbfounded. I did everything right. Why was he still mad at me?\nShortly after that, we took a break. I was walking toward the restroom, thinking about this and how\nI could “fix” it. The student approached me and said, “Hey, I'm really sorry I left. My boss texted me\nin the middle of class and said we have an emergency at work. I tried to tell him I couldn't do\nanything because I was in class, but he ordered me to leave and be on this ridiculous conference call.\nCan I make up the lesson I missed?”\nI literally started laughing, which I had to explain quickly, but I told him how I misinterpreted all\nthat I saw. I could hear Dr. Ekman in my head: “Chris, what have I told you before?” It was a great\nlesson for me in causality.\nThe same is true about OSINT and observation. Don't assume that the things I am about to show\nyou are all the results of the “stupidity of humans.” I prefer to think that people simply are\nuneducated to the potential dangers rather than being blatantly stupid.\nTake a quick look at the picture in Figure 2-2, and make a mental note of what you observe.\nFigure 2-2 What do you see?\nThinking like a social engineer, what do you see in this picture that could help you profile the driver\nof this car? Figure 2-3 is a zoomed-in version that might help.\nFigure 2-3 Is that easier to see?\nThe right side has a breast cancer support sticker. The left contains a Kids Wish Network Support\nsticker. Then there is a sticker that says “10-20-Life.” I had no clue what this was for, so I did a quick\nInternet search and found that it is a sticker supporting stricter sentences for those who commit\ncrimes using firearms.\nWhat do these stickers tell you about this person? That they support charities and which ones are\nimportant to them. Could this be because they or a family member suffered from cancer or\nchildhood sickness? Also, they feel strongly about gun laws and gun crimes. Could this be because\n27\nthey were a victim or know a victim of gun crimes?\nArmed with these pieces of information, do you think could strike up an elicitation conversation?\nBe careful! Too many times I have students who will blurt out, “We will discuss gun laws and why\nthey are wrong,” or something to that effect. But think about how hard it would be to convert you\nfrom one belief to another during a conversation. This person will be no different. Blend that with\nyour goal—to have the target not thinking—and remember that you want to converse about their\ninterests, not yours. I explain more about this in Chapter 7, “I Didn't Even Ask You for That,” when I\ndiscuss elicitation.\nNow take a look at Figure 2-4.\nFigure 2-4 What can you tell from this picture?\nWhat do you notice here? What could you observe as a social engineer? Think of the slight details in\nthis one simple picture:\nYou can see the type of work environment.\nYou can see the operating system the person uses.\nYou can notice what type of tablet the person has.\nYou can see the person is a fan of a certain sitcom.\nCan you notice the browser they use and mail client, too?\nDo you notice a sign that might indicate some other details about the person?\nWhat other details can you pick out?\nThis is just a cursory list; there may be much more that you picked out. Based on this, could you\ndevelop enough of a profile to work up one or two phishing emails that would trigger an emotional\nresponse?\nSometimes, however, a picture or even an in-person interaction is not enough. This is where\ntechnical OSINT can bridge that gap.\nTechnical Open Source Intelligence\nBefore you start writing a terrible review, telling the world how bad I suck because this chapter did\nnot contain an all-inclusive list of every tool known to man for OSINTers, let me make something\nvery clear:\nThis chapter does NOT contain a full list of every tool, every process, and every\nmethod of collecting OSINT from technical means.\nHere is what I can tell you: This chapter touches on the tools and techniques I use every day in my\n28\nbusiness. There are some amazing minds out there in the OSINT world who you can delve miles\ndeep with. Here are just a couple who I have been fortunate to come in contact with:\nNick Furneaux: I flew to the UK to take Nick's four-day course and was blown away. It is truly\neye-opening what can be done with APIs and an understanding of how social media applications\nwork. Nick's website is at www.csitech.co.uk.\nMichael Bazzell: Michael is the man when it comes to disappearing from the web, but he's also\ndeveloped an amazing set of tools for OSINT practitioners that can help them dig into social\nmedia sites and other search engines. You can find his website at inteltechniques.com.\nThese fine chaps are both friends of mine, and I have personally taken training, advice, and help\nfrom them. I can wholeheartedly say they are masters in the OSINT game. (Shameless plug: They\nboth have been guests on The Social-Engineer Podcast. Search for OSINT to find the episodes.)\nMy focus in the world of OSINT is on the daily practical uses for the work that I do, which can be\nbroken out into four simple topics: social media, search engines, Google, and other tools. I will touch\non each of these topics to give you a flavor of how I use them, and then you can use that knowledge\nas a foundation for further self-education.\nSocial Media\nNo chapter on OSINT would be complete without at least a cursory mention of the topic of social\nmedia. What is odd is that I can remember a time when reading your sister's diary would have\nresulted in multiple beatings. Now, personal diaries are not only online, but it's an insult if you don't\nread them, comment on them, and like them.\nSocial media is basically part of our everyday existence, and it is here to stay.\nHere are some statistics that will put this into order for us, according to We Are Social\n(https://wearesocial.com/special-reports/digital-in-2017-global-overview). As of\nJanuary 2017:\nThe world population was 7.476 billion.\nInternet users totaled 3.773 billion.\nThere were 2.789 billion active social media users.\nThere were 4.917 billion unique mobile users.\nThere were 2.549 billion active mobile social media users.\nThis is important for you, as a social engineer, to understand. Let's consider some of the top social\nmedia platforms:\nLinkedIn With over 106 million users, LinkedIn tells a person the following things:\nYour job history\nWhere you got your education\nWhere you went to high school\nClubs and academic achievements you're involved in\nPeople who endorse your skills\nFacebook With its more than 1.8 billion users, Facebook tells a person the following things:\nYour favorite music\nYour favorite movies\nClubs you belong to\nYour friends\nYour family\nVacations you've taken\nYour favorite foods\nPlaces you've lived\n29\nMuch, much more\nTwitter With its 317 million users, Twitter tells a person the following things:\nWhat you are doing right now\nYour eating habits\nYour geolocation\nYour emotional state (within 280 characters)\nI could go on, but you get the idea. Just those three social media applications provide a ton of\ninformation for you to discover about your targets. I dare say you can build a pretty comprehensive\nprofile on your target from this.\nFUN FACT\nOn episode 87 of The Social-Engineer Podcast, we talked to Dr. James\nPennebaker. He wrote a tool (www.analyzewords.com) that can analyze a person's\nTwitter account based on the language used. We ran Michele's Twitter account\n(@SultryAsian) through this tool, and she was evaluated as a spacey Valley Girl\nwith an upbeat, in-the-moment style. Honestly, I almost spewed water when I\nread that because it's the opposite of Michele in real life, but it's exactly how she\nwanted to be viewed over social media.\nEvaluating a person based on social media should not be confused with developing an actual\npsychological profile. As the Fun Fact mentions, there are people who communicate one way online\nand another in person. Even though that is true, social media is still valuable for a social engineer\nbecause many attacks occur based on the “online” personality and learning how to communicate\nwith that aspect of the target can lead to a breach.\nWith hundreds of social media platforms and billions of people using them, social media is a\ntreasure trove of data for social engineers. One of the best ways to rip information from social media\nplatforms is by using search engines, which is the topic of the next section.\nSearch Engines\nThe Internet is constantly changing, including new and improved ways of finding information in its\nyottabytes of cached data. Those constant changes can be a strength for most people, but they can\nalso become a weakness for social engineers because a search engine that works today may not work\ntomorrow.\nI remember when Spokeo first came out. I used it almost daily. It was an amazing source of great\ninformation. As its popularity grew, so did the number of ads. Then came the request to pay for\ninformation, and then information that was not as reliable seemed to pop up all too often.\nNow, I'm not saying that Spokeo has nothing useful, but as a professional social engineer, my time is\nmoney. And if I must use another source to verify every fact I get, it can cost me a job.\nIn my first book, and many subsequent books after, I have found that including lists of tools is kind\nof useless to the reader. A few things often occur:\nThe day the book is released, the tools are outdated and the ideas I gave the readers are old.\nNew and better tools come along.\nA combination of the first two things.\nInstead of giving you a list of websites and tools, I want to walk you through performing OSINT on a\ntarget. Yes, I will mention websites and tools that I use, but the focus will be more on how to think\nthrough this aspect of being a social engineer.\nOur target is my good friend Nick Furneaux (let's hope he stays my good friend after this book\ncomes out). It should be noted: there is no ill will toward Nick. I'm merely using him to show that\neven for a very aware, very alert, and very security-conscious person, the Internet holds secrets for\n30\nthose who know how to ask.\nd0xing the Furneaux\nSo, what does it mean to d0x someone? The word d0x is a hacker term that means to work up a\ndocument on a target containing details about the target's personal life. Those details are often used\nto further attack the target, humiliate them, or perpetrate other crimes.\nNone of those are the goals here. I'm just showing you the power of OSINT and how it can be used.\nOften, I start at the doors of pipl.com.\nPipl (pronounced people) is a site I describe as what would happen if the White Pages and social\nmedia scraped sites and had a baby. What is great about this site is that you can search for a name, a\nuser name, a nickname, or other details you may have about your target.\nJust looking at the web quickly tells us that Nick's Twitter account is nickfx. Let's see what we can\nfind by using pipl.com with that nickname. Take a look at Figure 2-5.\nFigure 2-5 Do you see him?\nWith just a quick glance, we can see the first picture brought up the right “Nick,” and only four lines\ndown, we see Nick Furneaux associated with Chris H (I wonder who that is) and a whole new user\nname.\nBefore we get to that, let's see what happens when I click the picture that we know to be Nick. The\nresult is shown in Figure 2-6.\n31\nFigure 2-6 Confirmation\nWith one simple click, we can see confirmation that we have the right guy as well as his location.\nOSINT! We know where he lives.\nNow, back up one page in the results, and click that fourth link down. What does that reveal? Take a\nlook at Figure 2-7.\nFigure 2-7 More OSINT!\nWe have some great OSINT here, don't we? A Facebook page and a hobby we didn't previously know\nthat Nick had. He is a snowboarder. And he must really like that Chris H character; he seems to be\n32\neverywhere.\nWhen I click the Facebook link, I'm greeted with even more OSINT!\nHe lives in Bristol, UK.\nI can see a list of friends.\nI've found a new username: nick.furneaux.1.\nWhen I head back to pipl.com and enter just his name and his known location of Bristol, England, I\nget even more details about him:\nPrevious employment\nLinkedIn profile\nYet another username\nWhere he went to school\nWith a handful of clicks, I have a decent amount of information on Nick that would definitely be\nuseful in developing a profile on him. Can I get more information?\nNext, I jump over to a site called webmii.com. The whole goal of WebMii is to help you see people's\nonline visibility. Running a search there for “Nick Furneaux” returns the results you see in Figure 2-\n8.\nFigure 2-8 A lot more info on Nick\nRight away, I notice a few things: Nick's visibility score is 4.22 (which isn't that high because it's out\nof 10). But clicking on that shows us when in time he was most visible (see Figure 2-9). As an\nOSINTer, the times when Nick was most popular would pique my interest—I want to find out what\nwas going on in his life at those times.\n33\nFigure 2-9 When was Nick popular?\nGoing back to the image shown in Figure 2-8, there are some other pieces of data to be gleaned:\nThe first image links to Twitter.\nThe third image links to a podcast where Nick was interviewed. It is The Social-Engineer\nPodcast, and I hear it is really amazing (another shameless plug).\nMany of the other images link to Canadian LinkedIn pages that don't pertain to the Nick\nFurneaux we're interested in.\nThe fifth image is weird: a young man in some kind of animal onesie. What is that?\nClicking that fifth link takes me to a music video made by a company called AFB Productions. When\nI click the More button, I see what's shown in Figure 2-10.\n34\nFigure 2-10 Even more OSINT!\nThe video appears to have been made by a chap named Toby Furneaux (same last name!), and the\ndriver in the video is none other than Nick Furneaux. Of course, this discovery opens another rabbit\nhole of digging into who this Toby is and what AFB is all about. It doesn't take long (just two or three\nclicks) to realize that Toby is Nick's son, and he runs a small production company called Any Future\nBox (AFB for short).\nA good OSINTer would include all of this detail in their info because family members (especially a\ntarget's children) are often great resources for attack vectors.\nRefer to Figure 2-8 again. That picture of Nick has been in a few places that I stumbled upon. This\npicture might lead to more resources, so I grab the actual URL of that picture and load it into a\nreverse image search, which you can do by following these steps:\n1. Right-click on the image.\n2. Click View the Image.\n3. Right-click again, and then click Copy Image Location.\n4. Go to www.google.com and click Images.\n35\n5. Click Paste Image by URL, and paste in the URL of the image that you copied in step 3.\nYou should see a page that looks like Figure 2-11.\nFigure 2-11 That's a whole lotta Nick.\nIn addition to seeing that he uses this same headshot a lot, I uncovered that Nick has a Blogspot\npage and wrote on a forensics page too. When I follow the link for the forensics page, I find an\ninterview of Nick from a few years ago, and that interview ends with his email and his website URL.\nWhen I do a quick WHOIS lookup of Nick's website domain name, it reveals what you see in Figure\n2-12.\n36\nFigure 2-12 Who is you?\nNick has had this website for a long time, and it's not expiring any time soon. Interestingly (and\nintelligently), Nick has his domain privatized. That means there is no info on the record; just his\ncompany name, which we already know, and that he is an individual in the UK.\nOSINT FACT\nThere are multiple ways to perform a WHOIS lookup. If you use Linux or Mac,\nyou can do it right from the terminal by typing whois DOMAIN (replacing\nDOMAIN with the actual domain). Or you can use a free website. There are\nseveral to choose from, but the one I use most often is http://www.whois.net.\nThe type of information-gathering I just walked you through is very common in the world of a social\nengineer. Think about why this is so. With very few clicks, I was able to uncover quite a bit of useful\ninformation on a target.\nGranted, I didn't find a link to all of Nick's passwords or his private photos (thank God for that), but\nI did find enough information to really help if I wanted to attack Nick with a phishing or vishing\nattack.\nIs that it, though? Absolutely not. Entering the ring is the heavy-weight champion of the world when\nit comes to OSINT.\nEnter the Google\nGoogle. The word alone should make a social engineer giggle with happiness. Okay, okay—that\nmental picture is pretty disturbing. So maybe put the idea of giggling aside and think of it more like\na silent smirk of knowledge-filled happiness.\nWhy? Google is like an all-knowing oracle. She knows all the things you ever did, stores them, and\neven caches them if you try to delete them (you know, for safekeeping).\n37\nGOOGLE FACTS\nGoogle is powerful. It owns about 88% of market share in search advertising.\nAccording to Google, the search engine has indexed more than 100,000,000\ngigabytes of websites (www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/crawling-indexing).\nWith all this power, and trillions of indexed web pages, how can one little ol' social engineer find the\ntiny bits of data he or she needs? Before I can answer that, I need to give you a quick explanation of\nhow Google (or any search engine, really) works.\nSearch Engine Mysteries Revealed!\nThere really is no mystery revealed in this section. The title is misleading. You probably already\nunderstand how search engines work, but on the off chance that you don't, here is a very quick and\neasy explanation of it.\nSearch engines use little pieces of code called spiders. Spiders “crawl” (I don't make this stuff up)\nthrough every web page on the open web and cache what they are allowed to access. There are\ncertain files, like robots.txt, that stop a spider from indexing certain areas, but most other areas\nare indexed and cached.\nThat cache is put into a database, which, when you enter a search term in the search box, provides\nresults like you see in Figure 2-13.\nFigure 2-13 He's baaacccckkk.\nLet me point out a few key things in Figure 2-13. First, the search returned 105,000 results in .59\nseconds. How can it search 30 trillion web pages in .59 seconds? Remember, these pages have been\ncached in a database, which allows for blazing-fast speeds in searching.\nScraping 105,000 web pages would be not only improbable but, most likely, impossible. So, let me\ntell you about operators.\nEnter the Operators\nGoogle has created a set of search terms called operators that limit what Google looks for. Think of\nit as being the difference between using a magnifying glass and a microscope. Both get you closer to\nan object you want to inspect, but if you really want to home in on the details, a microscope is the\nway to go. These operators are the microscope of searching.\nThe following two websites list all the useful operators for Google (and even some for Yahoo! and\nBing):\nhttps://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en&ref_topic=3081620\nwww.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html\nFor your convenience, here is a list of the operators I find the most useful:\nintext: This operator searches for whatever follows it “in the text” of the web page or document\nbeing searched. For example, if you type intext:csitech, Google searches for all occurrences of\nthat phrase.\nsite: This operator limits your search terms to the site you list. For example, if you type\nsite:csitech.co.uk, Google searches only that domain and nothing outside of it.\n38\ninurl: This operator may sound similar to the site operator, but it limits your search to any\nURL that contains the search term you type. If you type inurl:csitech.co.uk, the search would\nalso include any website that has the term ccistech.co.uk in its URL. For example, if there was\na site called forensicsmag.com/csitech.co.uk/interviews, it would be returned on this\nsearch but not in the search with the site operator.\nfiletype: This operator does exactly what it sounds like—it limits your search to the file type\nyou choose.\ncache: This operator searches for the cached version of the domain, file, or other artifact you\nlist.\ninfo: This operator gives you info on the domain you list here.\nLike most things involving software, there are rules. Google searching is no different.\nThe search term follows the operator, a colon, and no space. If you search for\nsite:whitehouse.gov, for example, you limit your search to whitehouse.gov. But if you search\nfor site: whitehouse.gov, you limit your search to the space after the colon (:), which is\nineffective.\nYou can use a hyphen (-) before an operator to remove those results from your search. For\nexample, if you know you want to find all csitech references but don't want any in the .com space,\nyou can try this search to limit your results: inurl:csitech.co.uk –site.com.\nIf you have a search term that is more than one word, and you want all of the words included in\nthe search, you must use quotation marks. For example, if I want to search for Nick Furneaux, I\ncould try intext:\"Nick Furneaux\" to include both first and last names in my intext search.\nAccording to Google (https://support.google.com/gsa/answer/4411411#requests), there is\na limit to the number of search terms allowed. The default is 50, and the upper limit is 150. (But\nhonestly, if you are searching with upward of 100 search terms, you might need help.)\nBelieve me, there are a lot more search terms and other goodies than what I listed here. Google is a\npowerful tool, and I could spend volumes delving into every little corner of it. But we need to get\nback to our OSINT. Let's work through some examples and see what we can find.\nLimiting for the Win\nWhen I interrupted my search for info about Nick Furneaux earlier in this chapter, I was on my way\nto creating a nice little profile about him. Can Google either reconfirm my findings or give even more\ninformation?\nI had found some information like his name and a nickname he uses on at least one social media\noutlet. What if I search for those two together to see what could be found? Typing intext:\"Nick\nFurneaux\" intext:nickfx into the Google search box will result in what's shown in Figure 2-14.\n39\nFigure 2-14 0 to 206 in .82 seconds flat\nIn less than one second, I have a solid 206 results on the target. One of the features of searching on\nGoogle is being able to see images related to your search. Clicking the More Images For link can\nshow you some interesting results. In this case, the images can take me to pages that talk about\nNick.\nBut I already know a lot of this information about Nick, so let's see what else I can find. I change the\nsearch term to intext:\"Nick Furneaux\" intext:UK. The results are shown in Figure 2-15.\n40\nFigure 2-15 Are we getting warm yet, Nick?\nThe first result tells me he is training in a town called Bristol. The last result provides the name of a\ncompany that Nick might still be a part as well as his full date of birth and even an address in—you\nguessed it—Bristol.\nThe page also includes a list of family or friends that he might be working with at that company. It's\na treasure trove of information.\nChanging the “UK” in the previous search to “Bristol” will lead us to information such as his postal\ncode and even some names of other family members that might be living with him.\nHere's one last example before I move on. What do you think would be the first result if you\nperformed the following Google search?\nintext:\"Nick Furneaux\" site:linkedin.com intext:Bristol\nThe first result I got when I did this search was Nick's LinkedIn page. Using the Google operators,\nyou can add little bits of information you get from your previous searches to keep homing in until\nyou find the exact piece you need.\n41\nI want to show you more about the power of Google, but since Nick is still my friend (or at least he\nwas the last time I checked), I'm going to move the focus away from him and on to general searches.\nBut It Says “Private” Right in the Title\nHave you heard of RSA private keys? An RSA key is a key that is based on a proprietary algorithm. It\ncomes in two parts: the public key, which helps identify it, and the private key, which unlocks the\nkingdom.\nAccording to this definition, RSA private keys are used to establish a secure connection.\nSo, you would think that if you searched for RSA private keys, you would find none, right? But using\nthe following search\nBEGIN (CERTIFICATE|DSA|RSA) filetype:key\ngives you more than 3,000 results, as shown in Figure 2-16.\nFigure 2-16 Why did you call it private?\nBut It's Marked Confidential\nOften, government entities mark documents with certain classifications to indicate whether the\ngeneral public should see them. Markings like “CLASSIFIED” and “TOP SECRET” usually indicate\nthat the documents aren't for general consumption. You would assume that you can't find any of\nthose online. (You know what they say about people who assume …)\nBut since I like living life outside prison walls, let's say we just want to see if there are any\ndocuments with passwords, which should be confidential, right?\nWhat if I searched for site:gov.ir intext:password filetype:xls? This should limit my search to any\ngov.ir domain and look for only XLS files with the word password in them. The results are shown in\nFigure 2-17.\nFigure 2-17 What went wrong?\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. Why would a document in an Iraqi government server have the\nEnglish word password in it? Ah, but what if I use the translate.google.com site to translate the\nword password into Persian? Does it help? Figure 2-18 shows the result.\n42\nFigure 2-18 Multilingual Google searches\nThe power of Google is truly shown here. I didn't need to know Persian or even search in Persian. I\njust had to tell it to look for that word, and I was able to find documents.\nWebcams: It's Time to Stop Dancing in Your Underwear\nThere was a boom in the desire for people to have webcams hooked up in their homes. People used\nthem for monitoring their children, babysitters, and pets; for security; and more.\nMany of these cameras were sold with default settings that left them vulnerable and wide open.\nSometimes the software sold with the cameras also left a lot to be desired. Easy for the user? Yes.\nBut also easy for attackers.\nOne such software was webcamXP. As indicated by its name, it was made to run on Windows XP,\nVista, 7, 8, 9, 10, Server 2003, 2008, and 2012. According to its website, the software's last update\nwas in 2016. With that in mind it should not be too popular today, so you would imagine that\nsearching for these now would not give you too much, right?\nRight?!\nSo, I searched for intitle:\"Webcam 7\" inurl:8080 -intext:8080, and Figure 2-19 shows the\nresult.\n43\nFigure 2-19 Webcams galore!\nGranted, many of these webcams are intended to be online and are meant for the public to see.\nThey're streaming traffic scenes or waterfronts and other areas. But there are people who set up\nwebcams for personal use and leave them open in their yards or homes. The point is that if these\nwebcams are not properly secured, any person with a little skill may be watching you, and you won’t\neven know.\nOther Sources of Intel\nUsually when I get to this point, people react with a mixture of horror and curiosity about what else\nyou can turn up with a Google search. I don't want to list every Google search I have done, but I can\ntell you some of the things that I have easily uncovered using only Google searches:\nA webcam of some guy watching his marijuana plants grow\n44\nPeople's private photos from their phones\nPeople's shared music and movie directories\nDocuments containing full passwords, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers\nThousands of credit card numbers in files\nFully open SQL databases loaded with info\nOpen access to traffic cams\nOpen access to power grids and control systems\nA number of child pornography drop spots\nThe list can go on and on.\nTwo Other Things\nThis section alone could be its own book. But before I move on and wrap up this chapter, I would be\nremiss if I didn't mention two other things.\nRobots Are Cool\nWhen I was a kid, I wanted a robot so bad. I thought R2D2 would be my best friend if I could get\none. In this case, I'm not talking about that type of robots. I'm referring to robots.txt files.\nWhat is a robots.txt file? It's a file that website owners use to tell the spiders or robots that crawl\nand scrape the sites what is and isn't allowable. For example, it's not uncommon to see Disallow\nstatements in a robots.txt file, which indicates that robots aren't allowed to cache that folder. For\nexample, Figure 2-20 is the robots.txt file for whitehouse.gov.\n45\nFigure 2-20 That's a lot of disallowance!\nNow think like a social engineer for a second. What does the file in Figure 2-20 tell you?\nYou can see what directories exist, but you can also see which directories they don't want you to\naccess—or that they don't want Google to cache.\n46\nIn addition, files like mysql or pgpsql give indicators of the type of tech used on the site in its\ncreation.\nNow, if this was an actual target (which it is not—I repeat, it is not), we would go to each of those\ndirectories to make sure it was appropriately configured and not allowing us in without\nauthorization. We would check out those logs and files, if they're accessible, to see if there was\nanything misconfigured in the servers.\nI once did a job for a medium-sized company. It was the rare “do all you can do and see what you\ncan find, then attack us with no gloves on” type of test. I started with a bit of OSINT and some\nGoogle searching, and I found in their robots.txt file that they had a Disallow statement on a\ndirectory called admin.\nJust to check it, I typed www.company.com/admin, and to my shock, I was let in with no credentials!\nThe directory contained the CEO's private file repository, and it appeared that he used this to share\nfiles he would need when traveling. It contained included contracts, banking data, a picture of his\npassport, and numerous other sensitive details.\nI found a contract that had been signed within the past couple of days. I bought a domain that was\none or two characters off of the real company name, set up an email for the person who signed the\ncontract, and phished the CEO with a malicious file and an email that stated: “I am not sure if I\nreplied with the fully signed contract, but there is a question on section 14.1a. Can you please see it\ninside and let me know?”\nWithin 15 minutes, the CEO had the email, opened it, and was compromised. He was then emailing\nthe fake address, saying that the contract would not open, and it just kept crashing. The penetration\ntest (aka pen test), which was supposed to take a week, was over in about three hours.\nI called the CEO, and our conversation went something like this:\nCEO: Hello\nMe: Hey, Paul. This is Chris over at Social-Engineer. I wanted to talk to you about the pen test… .\nCEO: Ha! Giving up so soon, Chris? I knew we were a hard nut to crack.\nMe: Well, Paul, we already have your passport, date of birth, credit cards, access to your banks,\nand a remote shell with admin credentials on the network. I thought I should call and see if\nyou really want me to continue for the week?\nCEO: Come on! You're making this up!! It just started a couple hours ago. Tell me, who is the loser\nthat clicked and gave shell? I want words with him.\nMe Well, Paul… . (I gulped hard, not sure if I could make the joke that was in my head.) I\nwouldn't go too harsh on him; he is a pretty cool guy.\nCEO: Oh yeah? Who?\nMe: Paul, it's you.\nI then explained every detail to him, and he realized quickly what had occurred. This particular pen\ntest was won largely due to a robots.txt file and a misconfigured directory.\nIt's All About the Meta, Baby\nAccording to the Oxford Dictionary, meta is defined as “referring to itself or to the conventions of its\ngenre; self-referential.” So, metadata is literally data about data. Very inception-esque, no?\nLet me explain it more simply. Metadata is information about an artifact that you find in a search.\nMany times, that data provides some pretty interesting facts—many that might not have been put\nthere intentionally.\nLet's say I do a very benign Google search to find .doc files that contain information about\npasswords. I come upon this little document called FinalPasswordPolicy. What will the metadata\nreveal? Take a look at Figure 2-21.\n47\nFigure 2-21 “What's-a meta you?!” (See what I did there?)\nThis metadata gives us the date and time it was made, the last person who saved it, the author's\nname/title, how many revisions the file has been through, and some other information I'm not\nmentioning here. You might be thinking, “So what?”\nWell, just the name and the type of document that something is can be huge pieces of intel for a\nsocial engineer. Think of this: What if a social engineer were to find a new HR policy you just\nreleased? The metadata reveals when the policy was last revised (in this case, it wasn't even a month\nold), who wrote it, and when it was released. Of course, the policy info is in the document, too. Do\nyou think a phishing email that seems to come from the person who wrote the policy and seemingly\nincludes an update to the policy would get a few clicks?\nHave a look at Figure 2-22.\nFigure 2-22 “No, really. What's-a meta you?!”\n48\nAt first, you again might be thinking, “Okay. So, are we gonna phish this guy with a coupon for hot\nsauce?” No. But take a look at the metadata, which is shown in Figure 2-23.\nFigure 2-23 The answer is …\nWhen you find a seemingly innocuous photo online, the metadata gives you information on the type\nof camera, the date, the time, and the GPS coordinates of where it was taken. When you put those\ncoordinates into Google Maps … well, look at Figure 2-24.\nFigure 2-24 That's pretty saucy, if you ask me.\nThe map shows the parking lot of Pepe's restaurant, which just happens to be a pretty large user of\nthat brand of hot sauce.\nSo, a guy used his smartphone to take a picture. His smartphone had GPS turned on and did not\nblock the camera app from embedding all that metadata in the back end of the photo file. When he\nuploaded the picture to his social media, the file contained all this information, so it was also\n49\nreleased to the world.\nCan you see the implications yet? Imagine it's not your buddy you're eating dinner with, but one of\nthe following:\nThe CEO of a large utility company who is being targeted by a nation-state attack\nThe secretary of a billionaire who has information on his banks and transfer authority\nYour 15-year-old daughter taking naughty pictures of herself\nNow can you see the implications? No matter which scenario you thought of, this easily accessible\ninformation gets dangerous quickly.\nI worked one job with my team in which we had been tasked to perform OSINT and then attack a\nhigh-level target in the defense space. The goal was not to compromise the man, but to test his level\nof willingness to take an action he should not take. For educational purposes, we were to record any\ncalls made and any click-throughs.\nLight OSINT led us to his social media pages. We hit pay dirt when we found out he was a prolific\ntweeter, and he loved to use his brand-new iPhone with GPS turned on. Why is this so important?\nTwitter allowed us to graph out his location throughout the day as he tweeted from every location he\nwent to. In a matter of a few hours, we knew the following things:\nHis favorite place to stop for coffee every morning\nThe gym he went to before he went home\nTwo of his favorite restaurants\nHis home address\nHow much he hated city traffic\nThere was much more OSINT, but the info in the preceding list came to be crucial in our attacks.\nFirst, we found a domain that was basically one letter different from his gym's domain. We set up a\nquick email that told him we were updating all accounts, and his credit card info was no longer\nvalid. We asked him to “log in to enter his credit card info now,” which prompted him to click\nthrough very quickly.\nKnowing the page was going to 404 out, we waited until we saw the click, and then we called him on\nthe phone. The conversation went something like this:\nCaller: Hello. Is this Mr. Smith?”\nTarget: Yes, it is. Who is this?\nCaller: This is Sarah over at Cold's Gym. We sent an email out earlier today about our system\nupgrade. Well, the email had a bad URL, so we are calling our customers to apologize. I\ncan send you out a new link or take your credit card and update it for you. What is easier\nfor you?\nTarget: No problem, Sarah, here is my card number.\nCaller: Thank you, Mr. Smith! See you tonight!\nThis attack worked because it hit topics familiar to him, and it was believable. With just a little\nOSINT, one phish, and one call, we had a click, a credit card number, and another five vectors\nprepared in case we needed them.\nMetadata is powerful and very useful to a social engineer, so I suggest that you make sure to check it\non every file you obtain during OSINT.\nThis can be daunting, especially when you're dealing with a large number of files. I personally like to\nuse tools like FOCA (www.elevenpaths.com/labstools/foca/index.html) and Maltego\n(www.paterva.com/web7) to make this job easier.\nAlthough I promised to not get too deep into any tools in this book, I feel it is imperative to at least\nbriefly cover these and two other useful tools, which I will do in the next section.\nTools of the Trade\nAs I say in Chapter 1, I decided not to focus too much on tools in this book, because tools change\n50\noften.\nHowever, there are four tools that have remained in my tool chest for the last 5 to 10 years, and I felt\nit would be wrong of me to not even mention them. Although these tools have stayed around for a\nlong time, they have had interface and functionality changes. If I were to spend a ton of time going\nthrough each feature, the information would be outdated by the time you get this book. Instead, I\nwill point you to the tools' websites where you can get tutorials and keep abreast of the latest and\ngreatest developments. I promise, this tour will be quick, but it's an essential piece of the puzzle you\nwon't want to miss.\nSET\nI can remember chatting with my good friend David Kennedy. I was telling him about my desire to\nhave a tool that allowed me to phish someone and automatically feed them a payload, grab\ncredentials, or clone any webpage. Dave's response was, “I think I can do that.”\nNot even a full 24 hours later, he had a prototype. From that moment on, Dave ran with what was\ncalled SET, or the Social Engineers Toolkit, like it was a life's mission.\nHe issues updates all the time—it seems like every day—and he has built-in features that make my\noriginal little ideas seem really lame. It's an amazing tool that has over two million downloads.\nYou can get the tool as well as instructions from www.trustedsec.com/social-engineer-toolkit.\nIntelTechniques\nOkay, this one is not really a “tool” per se as much as it's a collection of amazing search engines that\nmy good friend Michael Bazzell has put together.\nMichael is an expert at a few things, but there are two of them that he truly eats, breathes, and\nsleeps: finding people on the Internet and hiding from people who are looking for you on the\nInternet. Honestly, once Michael told me that to buy things from Amazon, I should set up a dummy\ncompany in Mexico, so I can get credit cards that don't tie back to me.\nMichael has set up an amazing collection of tools that search everything from social media, phone\nnumbers, IP addresses, and even reverse images. You can find these tools at\nhttps://inteltechniques.com/menu.html, and I suggest you spend some considerable time at\nthat site.\nFOCA\nFOCA stands for Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives. Way back at DEF CON 18 in\n2010, a small group of Brazilian hackers released the tool and took the Internet by storm.\nTo date, there is nothing else like FOCA in the world. It's a Windows-only tool that has gone through\nsome serious ups and downs over the years. At one point, I stopped using it because there had been\nno updates for some time, and there was no way to contact any person running it (and the tool\nwasn't open source).\nThen the folks at ElevenPaths took over the project. They did an update and released it on their\nwebsite at https://www.elevenpaths.com/labstools/foca/index.html. Sadly, FOCA is still\nWindows-only, but if you're not on Windows, it's worth setting up a virtual machine.\nThe speed at which FOCA grabs files and rips out useful metadata is amazing. Check it out.\nMaltego: The Granddaddy of Them All\nAt the risk of sounding like an infomercial for Maltego, I love this tool. I really do. The folks at\nPaterva do something you rarely see: They make an amazing tool, release a smaller free version (that\nis just as amazing), and keep the commercial version updated, so it's always moving forward and\nvery usable.\nWhat is Maltego, you ask? It is a tool that helps you collect data from online sources and then gives\nyou an interactive graph to display it. It can help you catalog, footprint, investigate, and make\nconnections with public sources of intelligence.\n51\nMaltego makes my work much easier than it would otherwise be, and the tool is easy and fun to use.\nIn addition, the guys at Paterva (the company that makes Maltego) offer amazing training videos\nand courses. Finally, Maltego is made for every platform.\nYou can check it out and download it right from the Paterva website at\nwww.paterva.com/web7/downloads.php#tab-2. I suggest you start with Maltego Classic.\nSummary\nKnowledge is certainly power, and there may be no better source of knowledge of your targets than\nOSINT. If you follow the principles in this chapter, practice, and hone those skills you can become a\nmaster and finding even the minute details hidden all over the Internet.\nYou have done all the OSINT. You have cataloged, collected, and documented every piece\narticulately. You think you have found the piece that will be your vector, and you need to start\npreparing your pretext. How will analyzing the data you found and looking for key indicators about\nthe target's communication style help? That is the topic of the next chapter.\n52",
    "question": "What is the importance of understanding and utilizing OSINT in the context of social engineering?",
    "summary": "The text discusses the importance of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) in social engineering, emphasizing the need to gather information through both nontechnical and technical methods. It highlights the value of observational skills in understanding targets' behaviors and environments, and explains how OSINT can be used to build detailed profiles. The text also covers various OSINT tools and techniques, such as using Google search operators, reverse image searches, and analyzing metadata, to uncover valuable information about targets. Finally, it stresses the importance of practicing and refining these skills to effectively apply them in real-world scenarios."

    "text": "3\nProfiling People Through Communication: (or Using Your Words Against\nYou)\nTo effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the\nworld and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.\n—TONY ROBBINS\nWhen I wrote Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking (Wiley, 2010), I spent some\nconsiderable time talking with Chris Nickerson, owner of Lares Consulting, about communication\nmodeling. He is quite skilled and has a deep understanding of the topic.\nHe really helped me to delve deep into the topic and understand some of the ways communication is\nused by social engineers. At the end of the day, I can boil down communication modeling to the\nfollowing key points:\nThere is always a source.\nThere is a message.\nThere is a channel.\nThere is a receiver.\nIf you are missing one of these, you don't have communication. Whether you look at the Shannon-\nWeaver model or Berlo's Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) model of communications,\nthey have similar principles.\nRegardless of which one you are familiar with, one of the things I've learned over the years is that\nthe exact model you use really doesn't matter. I know, I know—some of you are probably ready to\nstart burning this book in the streets, but here is why I say this.\nIf you apply this book's principles regarding rapport, influence, communication profiling, and so on,\nand the person you are communicating with is receiving the message, it will work. If you use these\nprinciples the way the person you are communicating with wants to be communicated with,\ncommunication will go exactly how you want it to go.\nEXTRA INFO\nIn 1947, Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver developed the Shannon-Weaver\nmodel of communication, which was also called “the mother of all models.”\nFifteen years later, David Berlo expanded on that model and created the SMCR\ncommunication modeling tool. Later, D. C. Barnlund combined and simplified\nthese tools, making a communication model that most of us are familiar with\ntoday. Barnlund’s theory is included in Communication Theory, Second Edition\n(Routledge, 2008) as Chapter 4, “A Transactional Model of Communication.”\nHere is the reference:\nhttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351527538/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315080918-\n5]\nYes, I realize this is a bold claim, and I don't mean that it's as simple as 1 + 1 being equal to 2.\nIt can be complicated. Oftentimes, we get in our own way. For example, I am a very direct\ncommunicator. Because of this, I don't mind someone telling me when something I did wasn't the\nbest—the key is that you need to tell me how to improve. I also tend to communicate that way with\nothers, which can cause a lot of problems when I am communicating with a person who doesn't like\ndirectness.\n53\nIt's not easy to just switch your communication profile on the fly, although it's easier for some\npeople than for others. The challenge occurs when we get comfortable and relaxed because our\nbrains trigger all the same chemical reactions we want in our targets, and those same reactions can\ncause us to slip back into our “comfort zone.”\nLet me illustrate it this way: Do you remember as a young adult (or a full-grown one) the first time\nyou tried something new? A new type of food, let's say. Since my kids were small, my wife and I\nencouraged them to always try something at least once. They didn't have to like it or finish it, but we\nsaid you can't make a judgment if you don't try it.\nOne year, we traveled to Hong Kong as a family. We went into a restaurant, and my daughter\nspotted an item on the menu that intrigued her—it was labeled “Whole Pigeon.” She asked me if she\ncould try it. My first inclination was to say, “Really, those nasty birds?” But I quickly recalled our\npractice of encouraging the kids to try new things.\nMy daughter ordered the pigeon, and then she looked at me and said, “Well Dad, what new thing are\nyou gonna try?” I had always been intrigued by sea cucumber, although I'm not sure I had ever\nwanted to eat it. Sounds harmless right?\nFigure 3-1 shows my daughter chowing down on her pigeon, but I don't have an image that shows\nyou what happened when I ate a sea cucumber. They are basically giant slugs that live in the ocean,\nso use your imagination.\nFigure 3-1 And yes, the pigeon's head was included.\nWhat does this anecdote about my family's eating habits in Hong Kong have to do with\ncommunication modeling? Well, as soon as I tasted the thing that was uncomfortable for me (and\nquite disgusting, in my opinion), I went looking for something very, very “American.” Why? It was\nfamiliar and comfortable.\nCommunication is much like this. The first time you step out of your comfort zone to try something\nnew, you might be uncomfortable and want to retreat to your comfort zone, especially if the\nexperience is not amazing. It is important to not stay in your comfort zone, though. The more you\ntry something, the greater likelihood it has of becoming part of your arsenal of tools.\nFUN FACT\nI've tried sea cucumber four times, and each time was as disgusting as the first.\n54\nThis does not relate to communication modeling, but I just thought you'd like to\nknow.\nTo help you master communication as a social engineer, I discuss the following key components in\nthis chapter:\nUnderstanding what a person is thinking upon approach\nGetting to know the DISC\nUnderstanding how to model your DISC style\nUsing DISC to your benefit\nIn other chapters of this book, some skills are independent of others in the same chapter, but for this\nchapter, all skills tie together and are important parts of each other. Let's get started with\nunderstanding what a person is thinking upon approach.\nThe Approach\nWhen I teach my five-day Advanced Practical Social Engineering course, inevitably a lot of the\nstudents have a problem with one area: the approach.\nIt is those first crucial seconds of interaction between you and a stranger that will set the tone for the\nrest of the engagement. Let me tell you a particularly embarrassing fail story to solidify this point.\nAfter class one day, I was with my good friend Robin Dreeke and a group of students. I was\nchallenged to show them how “easy” it can be to approach a complete stranger. Feeling pretty high\nbecause of all the positivity from the class, the dopamine flowing from teaching all day, and the\nadrenaline rush of the pending success, I was poised to use my glorious skill to show them all how\neasy it is to be a social engineer.\nAbout seven or eight of us were standing in a lobby discussing how I would do the approach, and\nRobin said he would pick my target for me. I am 6′3″ tall, and Robin picked a smaller man sitting on\na chair about 2 feet behind me. He was sitting on a couch reading while he waited for someone.\nNow, just picture this part of the scene in your head and consider what would be the best approach\nfor me. From behind? Heck no! That would startle the man and cause fear. Standing directly in\nfront? No again. He would have to look up, straining his neck, and that discomfort would not\nencourage a conversation. How would you do it? Take a second.\nWell, after Robin told me my target, I whipped around without a thought and said (in my loud New\nYork accent): “Hey, how you doing?! Can I ask you a quick question?”\nThe guy was so startled by the way I whipped around and my loud introduction that he leaned too\nfar back in his chair, lost his balance, and fell. I rushed to his side, embarrassed and worried that he\nwas hurt. Without thinking, I said, “Let me help you up.” He was much lighter than I anticipated,\nand I picked him and the chair up but used too much force, which sent him hurling forward on the\nfloor.\nHe looked up and yelled, “Leave me alone man! What the heck is wrong with you?!” (But he didn't\nuse the word heck, and the anger in his voice was extreme.)\nI turned away from him and said, “I am really sorry, sir.” I walked back toward the lobby with my\nhead hanging in shame as the group of students mocked me. Robin was laughing so hard, he was\ncrying, and I was defeated.\nYears of experiences like this, with tons of stories just like this, helped me define something that\nliterally changed the way I view communications. What do you think a person you are about to\ncommunicate with needs from you so they can feel comfortable and safe? Think about it.\nImagine you are standing on the street, and you see someone is obviously walking toward you and\nplanning to interact with you. What are you thinking? My experiences have helped me identify the\nfollowing four things:\nWho are you?\nWhat do you want?\n55\nAre you a threat?\nHow long will this take?\nWhen you approach someone, if you can answer these four things about that person in the first 5 to\n10 seconds of the exchange, you can change the way your whole interaction goes. This information\nsets the stage for many parts of this book, so fold or mark this page because I refer to it often. These\nfour factors also come into play in the following topics discussed in other chapters:\nYour pretext (Chapter 4, “Becoming Anyone You Want to Be”)\nThe first words from your mouth (Chapter 5, “I Know How to Make You Like Me”)\nBody language and facial expressions (Chapter 8, “I Can See What You Didn't Say”)\nFigure 3-2 is a graphic to help you remember these four things.\nFigure 3-2 These four points are crucial to communications.\nI'm not saying that every human is literally thinking about those questions in those exact words\nevery time another human approaches them, but they are part of the concerns, thoughts, or worries\nthat a person has. If you (the sender of the communication) can answer these four things in your\ninitial opening line, you can put the receiver at ease and allow that person to relax.\nConmen throughout history have known these facts and use various techniques to make their marks\nrelax before they get to the ask (the purpose of the interaction). Understanding this can not only\nmake you a much better social engineer, but it can also help you protect yourself when someone\ntries to use these techniques against you.\nThe first step is to understand your communication style. That is where we get into a very powerful\nbut simple communication profiling tool.\nEnter the DISC\nIn 1893, William Moulton Marston was born. At only 22 years old, he had a B.A. from Harvard;\nthree years later, he had his LL.B. from Harvard Law School; and then only three years later, he\ngraduated with his Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard. He took a job as a teacher at American\nUniversity.\nDuring his school years at Harvard, he was doing some research into the relationship between a\nperson who was telling lies and their blood pressure. And in 1915, he built a machine that would\nmeasure the changes in a person's blood pressure while that person was being questioned.\nIn 1917, Marston published his findings, and from that—you guessed it—the polygraph was born. In\nthe 1920s and ’30s, he was very active as a lecturer and government consultant. He was unique for\nthat time as he was not as interested in abnormal psychology as much as he was in the behavior of a\npopulation of people.\nIn 1928, he published a book called Emotions of Normal People, and in 1931, he published another\n56\nbook called Integrative Psychology: A Study of Unit Response. It was from these works that\nMarston derived the DISC system. He was looking for ways to measure the energy of behavior and\nconsciousness. Although he did not develop the test that I discuss in this chapter, he developed this\nmodel and then applied it in some work he did with Universal Studios in 1930. They wanted to\ntransition from silent pictures to movies with audio, and Marston's work was integral in helping\ncreate more-natural gestures and facial expressions.\nFUN FACT\nMarston was a big advocate for women's rights and the power of women. When\nhe was studying Greek and Roman classics as a young man, he took an interest in\nblending that schooling with women's rights. It was these passions that led Dr.\nMarston to develop the heroine Wonder Woman, for which he was inducted into\nthe Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2006.\nDr. Marston's work changed the way I look at social engineering. A lot of people were trying to figure\nout how to psychologically profile someone quickly, but Dr. Marston's more simplistic approach just\nresonated with me. I'm not a psychologist, so understanding your psych profile does little for me.\nBut I am a social engineer, so understanding how you communicate is like having the key to a lock.\nWhat Is DISC?\nDISC in an acronym. Some people use different descriptors, but the following make the most sense\nto me:\nD: Direct/Dominant\nI: Influencing\nS: Supporter/Steady\nC: Conscientious/Compliant\nEach of these is a descriptor of the way that style is represented. Often, DISC is represented in a\nshape. I use the one shown in Figure 3-3.\nFigure 3-3 DISC simply defined\nEach of these communication styles is represented in a unique way that helps us predict behavior.\nUsing DISC, you will find that people are predictably different.\n57\nLet's say you are dealing with a D or direct communicator. One direct communicator may be loud\nand boisterous; another may be quieter and firmer; a third may be right in between. Despite those\ndifferences, they all communicate directly and in a straightforward manner. As a result, if you can\nprofile the person quickly, you can alter your communication style to better influence the person.\nThere are always a few questions about this that always come up while I'm teaching my courses.\nHere are two of the most common ones:\nQuestion: How do I know my preferred style?\nAnswer: This is a great question, but not easily answered, so I get into this in the following\nsection.\nQuestion: Can I be more than one style? Or a blend of a couple?\nAnswer: Yes, we all have strengths in more than one style, and it's possible to be strong in more\nthan one. Some people do end up at the intersection of styles, and it's possible to change a bit\nover time.\nEven though this assessment method is very accurate, keep in mind that any assessment like this is\nnot always 100% (at least in my opinion). It is subject to change based on the way a person answers\nand by the scenario.\nThe way I think about it is that this is another tool in your arsenal as a professional social engineer.\nIt helps you get closer to truly using all the skills of the pros.\nBefore I can even get into how you would use DISC as a social engineer, I need to discuss something\nthat is possibly one of the most important parts of this book: understanding your own\ncommunication styles first.\nTo Know T hyself Is the Beginning of Wisdom\nThat title is not a weird riddle; it's the basis of truly understanding how communication profiling\nworks. Before you can become a master at communicating with others, it is essential that you\nunderstand yourself first. Let me explain.\nA chef has many different knives in his kitchen. I have 4-inch, 8-inch, and 10-inch knives. Each has\na different shape and weight and is for a different purpose. Figure 3-4 shows a variety of knife styles.\nWhich knife do you think is the best for chopping a head of cabbage?\nFigure 3-4 Choose wisely.\nI would choose the knife that's the fourth from the right because it has the weight needed to cut\nthrough a thick vegetable, and it has the length to go all the way through, which would make the\ncutting easier on my arms and wrist. I have seen some people choose the knives that are in the fifth\nor sixth position from the right to chop cabbage, and guess what happens? A few minutes into\nchopping, and their hands are sore and their wrists hurt—there's also a great risk of injury when you\nuse one of those knives. By knowing which tool is best for the job, how to properly use it, and what\n58\nits strengths and weaknesses are, you can choose the perfect tool for the job.\nDISC is like this illustration. Some profiles work better for certain tasks than others. Knowing your\nstyle can help you truly understand your strengths and your weaknesses. It can help you to see how\nyou can clearly communicate your thoughts and your intentions. It can also greatly increase your\nchance of not putting off the person you are communicating with, which, as a social engineer, is a\nvery important part of the job.\nThere are a few ways I help people learn about their dominant communication styles, but mostly I\nuse a DISC assessment tool that helps a person to learn about themselves easily. But wait! Before\nyou go running to your Internet browser and searching for “free DISC assessment,” let me tell you\nwhy that might not be the best idea.\nMany online assessments that I have previewed use a method that I consider flawed. They give you a\nsentence and ask you to answer a predefined set of questions regarding that situation. For example:\nImagine you are Chris's manager and he just acted insubordinately. What should you do?\nA. Fire him on the spot.\nB. Make a few jokes about it and move on.\nC. Sit him down and explain in detail why what he did was wrong.\nD. Try to help him to see why his attitude is not good for the team.\nThe problem with questions like this on a DISC assessment is that you might not have any context\nfor being able to answer it. What if you never managed another person? What if you never managed\nan insubordinate person? There are too many variables that make this a bad question and can lead\nto inaccurate results.\nIf you're going to look for an assessment test to use, I encourage you to look for one that gives you\nword choices and ask you to choose one that is most like you and one that is least like you, as\nopposed to scenario-based tests. Here's an example:\nFrom the list of words, choose one that you feel describes you the most and one that describes\nyou the least. Even if you do not have really strong feelings toward these words, one will describe\nyou the most and the least according to your personal assessment.\nMOST LEAST\nLogical Logical\nSerious Serious\nObedient Obedient\nFree-willed Free-willed\nWith sentences you are trying to imagine a situation that you never experienced, which can be really\nhard for many people. This is why I like to recommend assessments that use word pairs. This type of\nassessment allows the science at hand to work more accurately.\nI often tell my students to answer each question while thinking about how they behave at work,\nwhich is often much different than when they are at home. As a result, I get a consistent and honest\nrepresentation of their communication profiles.\nUnfortunately, I haven't figured out how to administer a DISC assessment test to every reader of this\nbook, so I must be a little creative to help you understand how powerful this is.\nLook at Figure 3-5.\n59\nFigure 3-5 Understanding DISC\nWhile focusing on the words outside the circle in the figure (i.e., ignoring the words inside the circle\nfor now), answer these two questions about yourself:\n1. Are you more direct or indirect in your communication style? Wait! Before you answer that,\nremember that I am not asking you what you think others think about you—I'm asking you to\nhonestly appraise whether you are more direct or indirect. Do you get to the point quickly, or do\nyou take your time? Do you have a problem with directness or do you enjoy it? Now, based on\nyour answers, write down “Direct” or “Indirect” as your communication style.\n2. Are you more task-oriented or people-oriented? When you are involved in a task at work, do you\ncare more about getting it done or about the people that will help you get it done? Based on your\nanswer to this question, write down “Task” or “People.”\nIf I were taking this test, I would write down “Direct” and “Task.” In Figure 3-5, the wedge that is\nbetween Direct and Task is labeled D for direct. See how fast that is?\nNow fully assess yourself. Where did you end up? Now look at Figure 3-6 for more details.\n60\nFigure 3-6 DISC in detail\nUsing myself as an example, I put myself in the D section and see that I am direct, results-oriented,\nfirm, strong-willed, and forceful. That is just about a perfect description of me. (It's almost scary\nhow accurate that is.) What does this mean, though?\nI favor a direct style of communication. Remember, this is not a psych profile—it's a communication\nprofile. And understanding this means you can see more clearly where you might have to alter your\nmethod of communication to better influence your target.\nNow that you've answered my two test questions, you should have a pretty accurate assessment of\nyourself. But what does this mean when it comes to profiling other people? And how can you use\nthat information?\nUsing DISC to Your Benefit\nDISC profiling has been so effective that my team has used it on social media, voice calls, and even\nphotos with alarming accuracy.\nRobin Dreeke shared with me a story of a profile he built on a target by using only one photo of the\nguy. Let me paint the scene for you.\nThe photo shows a busy city street where there has been a car accident. It's not deadly—just a fender\nbender. The street is filled with people running toward the cars to see if everyone is okay. The target\nis standing with his back to the accident, not looking—his shoulders slumped down, and his hands\nin his pocket. That is all.\nBased on the description of the scene, where would you put him on DISC diagram?\nThink about those questions I asked you. Based on what I've told you about the photo, is the man\nmore task-oriented or people-oriented? You really can't say “people-oriented,” can you? So, the\nanswer would seem to be “task-oriented.”\nIs he direct or indirect? While everyone else is focusing on the accident, he shows a lack of\ndirectness in that area. Robin guessed indirect.\nThat would put the target in the bottom-left segment, or in C, on the chart in Figure 3-6—which\nmakes him analytical, reserved, precise, private, and systematic. He was heading somewhere, and\nthat task took precedence over anything else. His body language did not scream outgoing or forceful,\n61\nwhich lands him most accurately in the C region.\nThat ended up being a great profile for Robin to use, and if you read his book It's Not All About\n“Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone, you can see exactly how it\nended. (Hint: he was successful.)\nI have been able to train people in our classes to learn how to make these kinds of assessments in a\nmatter of minutes by just focusing on the four aspects of DISC and putting the person in the right\nquadrant. But what if you can't answer all of the questions perfectly?\nPutting DISC to Work\nImagine if you couldn't tell whether I'm task-oriented or people-oriented, but you know whether I'm\ndirect or indirect? You can still effectively communicate with me as a direct person, even if I'm also\nin the Conscientious or Supporter category.\nThe same would hold true if you knew I was in the Task category instead of the People category. You\ncan communicate with me as either a D or C and be better off than if you communicate with me as\nan S. See how that works?\nHere's a little test. Take a look at the Twitter page of our old friend Nick Furneaux, at\nhttps://twitter.com/nickfx?lang=en.\nNOTE\nNick is not a prolific tweeter. For that reason, you may have to think a little\ndeeper in this exercise.\nPRO TIP\nIt is important to not get lost in retweets when doing this. Retweets do not give\nyou an accurate picture of the person's communication style. I tend to look at all\nmedia and tweets that a person posts as their own.\nWould you say Nick is more task-focused or people-focused? Read over his tweets and see where his\ncomments seem to fall. I read them and think task, for sure. Now is his style direct or indirect?\nHmm … this one seems a bit harder.\nTake a look at the media he posted. I see very direct messages about things, not people. This\nconfirms for me that Nick is more of a D.\nEven if you cannot pinpoint someone 100%, you can get close. In the case of Nick, you can see he is\ndefinitely task-focused rather than people-focused. So guessing that he's a D or C would be okay.\nAnother secret of the trade is to look at some of the descriptors the person uses. Jump back to\nFigure 3-6 and look at the descriptor words next to both D and C. Which words describe what you\nsee in Nick's tweets? Is he more direct, forceful, and results-oriented? Or is he precise, private, and\nsystematic?\nWhen I read these tweets, I certainly see more of a D than a C. Does this mean Nick is 100% a D\ncommunicator? Not exactly—sometimes people communicate a certain way depending on where,\nhow, and with whom they're communicating. For instance, when I train, I tend to communicate\nmore as an I than a D. It is better for me, the students and everyone else involved. If you wanted to\ninfluence me, you need to figure out how I communicate in the medium you are trying to influence\nme in.\nConfused yet? Don't overthink this. Remember, this is one arrow in your quiver, and it helps you get\ncloser to the target in the first few minutes of conversation.\nBack to our example: If by now you have profiled Nick as a D, how do you then use this information\nto your benefit? To answer this, you first need to understand a little bit about how to communicate\n62\nwithin each style whether you are in a position of authority or not.\nThe D Communicator\nIf you are going to communicate using an authority pretext:\nBe direct and straightforward\nSet firm boundaries\nBe brief and to the point\nAnswer the what\nIf you are going to communicate using a more subdued pretext:\nStress the what, not the how\nGive options but emphasize the result\nFocus on logic\nAgree with facts and positions, not just the person\nThe I Communicator\nIf you are going to communicate using an authority pretext:\nBe friendly and relaxed\nAllow the other person to do most of the talking\nHelp their ideas get translated to action\nAnswer the who\nIf you are going to communicate using a more subdued pretext:\nStress the new and special\nProvide give and take\nDo not dominate\nQuote “experts” and testimonials\nThe S Communicator\nIf you are going to communicate using an authority pretext:\nBe systematic and objective\nBe relaxed and friendly\nUse consistency and answer the why\nClearly define what you are asking for\nIf you are going to communicate using a more subdued pretext:\nBe patient\nAsk how questions\nMake the focus about the team\nThe C Communicator:\nIf you are going to communicate using an authority pretext:\nBe detailed\nBe dependable\nProvide recognition\nAnswer the how\n63\nIf you are going to communicate using a more subdued pretext:\nUse data and stats\nProvide logic and facts\nStress reliability\nUsing the descriptions of each of the communication styles, let's do a little exercise. Assuming\nMichele is an I and I'm a D, what do I need to change to influence Michele? (You can also do this\nexercise by thinking about your own style and deciding what you'd need to change to influence\nMichele.)\nI would want to be brief, factual, and to the point, but Michele prefers a friendly give-and-take\nexchange that not overly dominant. Do you see where the challenge comes in? I need to make sure\nthat I can craft a pretext that allows me to hit the points that will make Michele happy and open the\ndoor for influence. To be a good influencer, you must think more about what the other person wants\nwhen communicating and less about how you prefer to communicate.\nUnderstanding the Limitations\nThe great part is that this works whether you're communicating in person, on the phone, in an\nemail, or over social media. You just need to figure out the target's communication style, your\nmedium for delivery, and your goal for the communication. From there, the rest seems easy.\nPlease don't get fooled into thinking that this is a magic wand. There are factors that can add to the\nsuccess or subtract from it. Just because you profile the target, make the right assessment, and craft\na message that will tickle them in their communication happy zone doesn't mean you will always\nhave 100% success. Sickness, stress, workload, and many other factors can affect someone's ability\nto communicate effectively. Need proof that there are limitations? Think about your kids (or the kids\nof people you know).\nMy daughter can melt my heart in a nanosecond. Despite her seemingly superhuman ability to get\nme to do almost anything, when I am under stress or there are too many things on my plate, I can be\nless patient and kind with her than I normally am. My communication method changes, which\nhappens to everyone who's dealing with external circumstances.\nPractice makes perfect though, so don't give up on this if you don't succeed the first couple dozen\ntimes. When you do get it right, it's amazing how well it works.\nHere is another story: When my first book was released, I was asked to do a book signing. I hadn't\nexpected that, and I was surprised by the nice line of people who had paid for my book and wanted\nme to sign it.\nMany people said many nice things about my book and me—it was a little over-whelming, to say the\nleast. One young man approached me —and talked for a solid minute about how my book changed\nhis life. It had helped him through some rough times and even gave him a career path. I was so\noverwhelmed by this, I clearly remember thinking to myself, “Is this for real or another joke from\nDave? Why would anyone say these things to me about my book?” I gave him a small smile, thanked\nhim, and handed back his signed book. He was noticeably disappointed, but people were waiting in\nline behind him, so I moved on. About four or five other people came through the line, and the\nyoung man was standing over to the side with body language that clearly showed me that he wasn't\nhappy.\nAnother young man came into the line and handed me his book to sign and said, “It was good, but\nthere are about four things I saw that are really wrong, and you quoted Wikipedia four times. That is\njust bad as an author.” I looked up at him, gave him a huge smile, and asked him to sit with me at\nthe table so that when the line died down, he could show me where in the book he felt I went wrong.\nAs he came around the table to sit next to me, the first young man came running back to the table.\nHe was very obviously angry now. He said a few expletives and then said, “I sat here and told you\nthat you changed my life and how much of a fan I am, and you brushed me off like I don't even\nmatter!!!! But this guy comes up and tells you that you suck, and you're his best friend???!?! What\nthe … ?”\nAt that moment, I honestly had no response. I was dumbfounded by his anger, but I also understood\nit. I apologized and asked him to come sit and talk, but he was too upset. He walked out really angry.\nIt wasn't until much later as I replayed that whole scene in my head over and over that I clearly\n64",
    "question": "How can understanding a person's communication style, such as their DISC profile, help in effectively influencing or communicating with them?",
    "summary": "Communication modeling involves understanding the source, message, channel, and receiver in any interaction. It's crucial to adapt your communication style to match how the person you're interacting with wants to be communicated with. The DISC model helps identify communication styles—Direct, Influencing, Supporter, and Conscientious—each with distinct characteristics that influence how people interact. By understanding your own style and the target's, you can better influence them and achieve your goals in social engineering."

    "text": "understand what had happened. That young man was an I, and he was communicating to me as an I\nwould—energetic, outgoing, lively, friendly, and so on. His I communication style was so strong that\nI—as a strong D—didn't know how to process it, so I shut down and moved on. But when the second\nyoung man challenged me and told me how I could improve, his style resonated with me, and I\nwanted more.\nWhat could I have done to fix the problem? Or better yet, what should I have done to avoid that\nproblem altogether?\nCommunicate on the person's level. When the first young man came up with the flowery praise, I\nshould have done the following:\nAsked him what part of the book really helped him\nComplimented him, if I could do so honestly and realistically.\nActively listened and then offered to have him follow up for more conversation since the line was\nlong\nThese things would have left him feeling validated and special rather than angry and tossed aside.\nThe moral here is that even when you screw up, take the time to play it back in your head and see\nwhat you can learn from your mistakes.\nSummary\nDISC is a powerful tool that can get you closer to building rapport and making your target trust you\nand want to help you. Learn to read people quickly, and then learn how to apply your profile and\nadjust your style so you can communicate with your targets more easily.\nDon't overcomplicate this process, though. Remember that even being able to place a person in just\none half of the DISC circle will drastically up your game. It is important to remember that DISC is\nnot like street magic. You aren't going to become a human communication-modeling savant\novernight (or maybe ever).\nThat shouldn't be your goal anyway. Your goal should be to keep the conversation focused on the\nperson—not on yourself—and keep those two chemicals I mentioned in Chapter 1 (dopamine and\noxytocin) flowing. By doing this, you will build trust and rapport, which makes your job as a social\nengineer easier.\nAt this point, you may be saying, “Wow, this is basically a recipe for weaponizing communications.”\nYou aren't wrong. The fact is, many things that were not intended to be used as weapons are often\nweaponized. Automobiles are a good example of this.\nI have a car that I love. I love driving it. It's a car I've always wanted, and now I have it. When Audi\nmade the car, I don't think they planned on so many auto accidents being hit-and-runs. Yet\naccording to a 2016 report by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, over 11% of all car-related\naccidents are hit-and-runs.\nWhat's the point? The car can be a beautiful machine that is fun to drive and can take you places. It\ncan also be a deadly weapon. It depends on the person and how they use it. Using DISC is the same.\nMy mantra at Social-Engineer, LLC, and during our five-day training is simple: “Leave them feeling\nbetter for having met you.”\nIf you keep this in mind, the skills you will learn in this book will not only help you defend yourself\nand help you catch the attackers, but it can also help you be successful as a social engineering\nprofessional.\nWhen you profile a person's communication style, do not look for ways to exploit them or\nmanipulate them. Look for ways to alter your style so you can communicate with them on their level,\nin the way that makes them happy.\nPractice what you've learned in this chapter with family and friends before you try your hand at\napplying it in social engineering. After you have sufficiently proven you're on the right path with the\ncommunication model, begin to put small requests for actions you want your target to take into your\nconversation. Test the waters.\nWhen you see it working, you can start to move into the next topic—one that will take your skills to\n65\nthe next level—pretexting.\n66\n4\nBecoming Anyone You Want to Be\nEverything you can imagine is real.\n—PABLO PICASSO\nIf I could, I would have this chapter open with the Mission: Impossible theme song, but sadly we\nhaven't figured out how to embed music into the pages of a book. But at least I have you thinking\nabout that catchy tune, which is fitting for this chapter.\nBecoming anyone you want be—which in social engineering is called pretexting—sounds super sexy.\nSome people define pretexting using words like lie, falsehoods, and other negative terms. However, I\nlike to define pretexting in more general terms. The way I explain it in The Social Engineering\nFramework on my company's website (www.social-engineer.org/framework/influencing-\nothers/pretexting) is this:\nPretexting is defined as the practice of presenting oneself as someone else in order to obtain\nprivate information. It is more than just creating a lie; in some cases it can be creating a\nwhole new identity and then using that identity to manipulate the receipt of information.\nPretexting can also be used to impersonate people in certain jobs and roles that they never\nthemselves have done. Pretexting is also not a one-size-fits-all solution. A social engineer will\nhave to develop many different pretexts over their career. All of them will have one thing in\ncommon: research.\nIn one job, I had to break into seven different warehouses, and I decided to pose as a fire\nextinguisher inspector. In another job, we had to gain entry to the C Suite and the mail room of a\ncompany, so I pretended to be a pest control serviceman. For yet another job, I had to gain access to\nthe security operations center (SOC) and network operations center (NOC), so I started off as an\ninterviewee for a job, but after I gained access to the building, I had to switch to something else—so I\nposed as a manager from out of state. I've also presented myself as the head of human resources\n(HR) and a phone support rep. I could go on and on, but you get the idea: I've played lots of\ndifferent roles.\nThe point is that there is no such thing as one pretext that fits all situations, and that is why this\nchapter is so important. I spend most of the chapter talking about the principles of pretexting and\nhow you can apply them to any situation, whether you are social engineering via phone, email, social\nmedia, or in person. I take you through one job that I feel helps truly explain all these principles.\nThe following are the principles I discuss in this chapter:\nThinking through your goals\nUnderstanding reality versus fiction\nKnowing how far to go\nAvoiding short-term memory loss\nGetting support for pretexting\nExecuting the pretext\nPretexting can be one the most fun parts of the job, but it can also be one of the most dangerous. If\nyou do not apply these principles, there can be drastic consequences. I will tell you stories of both\nsuccesses and failures when it comes to pretexting.\nKnowing how to pretext is vital if you want to have a career as a professional social engineer. It can\ntruly make the difference between success and failure on the job.\nThe Principles of Pretexting\nBefore I delve into each one of the principles, I want to discuss a technique that has helped many\naspiring social engineers: method acting or improvisation (aka improv).\n67\nMany cities offer method acting or improv classes that anyone can attend for a couple weekends.\nMany of the tips I give you in this book are covered in those kinds of classes, but the classes can give\nyou something that a book can't help you with: experience.\nA method acting or improv class can help you learn to step out of your comfort zone, get into\ncharacter, and learn what is needed to successfully plan and execute pretexts in the wild. However,\nnot everyone reading this book will be able to find a local class. No worries: you can purchase a DVD\ncalled Uta Hagen's Acting Class from Amazon.com (www.amazon.com/Uta-Hagens-Acting-Class-\nDVDs/dp/B0001Z3IHG). You can also find the video by searching YouTube. This excellent resource\ntakes you through the steps of pretexting and getting into character.\nHowever, even with a good acting class or video, you still need to know the six best tips for learning\nto pretext. Let's get started with the first one.\nPrinciple One: T hinking T hrough Your Goals\nFire extinguisher inspector, pest control serviceman, HR manager—these are just a few of the\npretexts I mentioned that I have used. How did I go about determining which one to use at each\nlocation or target?\nIt all starts with OSINT, where I dig into the details of the person or company and look for relevant\nstories, news, hobbies, likes, dislikes, events, and so on (and which I cover in more detail in Chapter\n2, “Do You See What I See?”). These significant bits of data can tell me a lot about which pretext I\nshould I focus on. But there is one other key piece of information that will determine which pretext\njumps out of my arsenal into action: the goal. Understanding what it is I am trying to accomplish is\nmore important than just understanding the business I am trying to infiltrate. Let me illustrate by\ntelling you a story that I call, “The 18th-Floor Escapade.”\nI was hired to gain entry to the 18th floor of a secure building. The building was owned and operated\nby a property management company that was not my client (a company that produces online audio\ncontent). The only floor I was allowed to gain access to in this test was the 18th. Generally, this\ncompany does not allow walk-in appointments. The elevators were key-carded. And corporate\nheadquarters was in another state.\nDuring the OSINT phase, my team had found very little about the names and identities of the client\ncompany's employees who worked inside the target building. However, we did find a manager of the\ncompany’s name as well as some of the content that manager produced there.Additionally, we\nlocated some documents on a file server that the company didn't intend to be public: a safety\nchecklist, some internal communications newsletters, marketing material about upcoming projects,\nand a few other miscellaneous documents.\nBased on just this information, what seems like a good pretext to you? Think about it for a second\nbefore reading on. Try to come up with at least one pretext.\nMaybe you thought of an elevator repairman? That would give you reason to be in the elevator\nwithout alarming security. Maybe you thought of a rep from the company's headquarters who was at\nthe office to conduct a surprise audit? Or maybe you thought of a different pretext that I didn't even\nmention here.\nHere are a few other details that will help inform the pretext: My mission, if I did get inside the\nbuilding and to the 18th floor, was to successfully take video and photos of exits and entryways. I\nwas to take photos of any unlocked computers and try to get pictures of any papers or projects that\nwere not public.\nGiven all those details, I had to make sure my pretext covered the ability to roam close to computers\nand desks, and I had to either have a camera out or be able to use a hidden camera to get the\nrequired photos.\nAn elevator repairman would have been a terrible pretext to accomplish the goals. Would it have\ngotten me in the building? Yes, but I wouldn't have gotten anywhere near my goals.\nPosing as a representative from headquarters—might have gotten me into the building and onto the\nfloor and even into offices, but there would have been limitations. I would have needed to know who\nworked in that office so my “surprise visit” could be fruitful.\nFrom the safety checklist that I'd found on the file server, I learned that this company had strict\nguidelines about their staircase doors. They were never to be unlocked from the staircase. As a\n68\nmatter of fact, there weren't even supposed to be handles on the doors that were accessible from the\nstairwell.\nUsing this information, I developed a pretext that I was a third-party safety consultant. Because of a\nproblem found in another branch, I had been sent to do quick 15-minute checks of the exits to\nensure that proper policies were being followed. My visit was not announced, so the staff at the\noffice I was visiting could be surprised and be found handling things correctly without any warning.\nTo ensure the client that I was honest, I needed to record the whole event on my camera.\nDo you see how having specific goals changed my pretext for the better? Having the full details\nenabled me to develop a part of the pretext that helped me achieve all my goals without causing\nalarm. Powerful, right?\nArmed with this information, let's jump into the second principle, where I'll give you more details\nabout “The 18th-Floor Escapade.”\nPrinciple Two: Understanding Reality vs. Fiction\nThis principle can be easily defined by explaining how much easier it is to remember your pretext if\nyou base it in reality—for you and for the target. By this, I mean you should try to use pieces of your\nreal life and use knowledge you already have or can easily assimilate. I often tell people that I think\none of the hardest relationships to fake is a father-daughter relationship. I didn't understand this\nrelationship until I had my own daughter. The way I talk about her and the emotions I feel are near\nimpossible to fake, I think. If I didn't have a daughter but needed to build rapport with a target who\ndid, it would be dangerous to have a pretext that includes a fake daughter. But, I can have a niece,\nright?\nMy point is that your pretext should be based on facts, emotions, and knowledge that you already\npossess or can easily fake. Going back to some of my proposed pretexts from the previous section, I\nknow very little about elevators and their operation, so trying to fake my way as an elevator\nrepairman would most likely have led to my failure if I were to be quizzed.\nIn addition, I tend to choose a name that I can easily answer to. Some people can answer to a name\nthat is not theirs, but most choose to go with one that they have used or been called or that is a\nvariation of their name.\nThis probably goes without saying, but generally, I try to stick with male characters for onsite, in-\nperson social engineering. But I have pretexted as a female when doing online, social media, and\neven phone social engineering.\nFUN FACT\nMany companies in the United States have a policy that their support staff must\nnever question a caller's gender. So, when someone with the name “Sally” calls in\nand has a voice like Barry White, you just don't ask. You risk offending the person\nif they have a voice that is unusual. With this knowledge, I have used the names\nChristina, Christine, and Laurie when making phone contact.\nIn terms of reality for the target, you should try to base your pretext on something that will keep\nyour target in that alpha mode. (You might remember the discussion of alpha mode in Chapter 1, “A\nLook into the World of Social Engineering.”)\nIf the subject is familiar to the target—meaning the words, titles, and context are expected—then you\nare more likely to leave the target in alpha mode so the person isn't alerted to potential danger.\nFor my “The 18th-Floor Escapade,” I was using a document that I had found during OSINT. I wasn't\ntrying to learn new skills, so I was not only in the reality zone for my targets but also in my own\nreality zone.\nSometimes, though, as you start to plan out the reality, you may have trouble trying to decide how\nmuch is too much.\n69\nPrinciple Three: Knowing How Far to Go\nKnowing how far to go—without going too far—is very important. In my classes, I often have\nstudents who want to build whole lives for their pretexts. Some want to get as detailed as what they\nate at their 11th birthday party.\nWhen it comes to deciding how much detail to create, keep this in mind: people will only care about\nwhat they have to in order to complete the “social contract” you have created.\nLet me elaborate on that a bit. In my safety-inspector pretext for “The 18th-Floor Escapade,” what\ndo you think the target cared about?\nIn this case, they didn't care about my kids' names, my dogs, or what I had for breakfast. They cared\nabout the four questions I mention in Chapter 3, “Profiling People Through Communication”:\nWho are you?\nWhat do you want?\nAre you a threat?\nHow long will this take?\nLet's think through what the target will want to know ASAP regarding my pretext:\nQ: Who are you?\nA: I am a safety inspector sent by corporate to do a very quick audit to ensure all policies are being\nfollowed.\nQ: What do you want?\nA: I just need about 15 minutes of your time to do this quick audit.\nQ: Are you a threat?\nA: There is an urgent need for me to do this, but no one is in trouble at all.\nQ: How long will this take?\nA: Hopefully less than 15 minutes.\nThe rest of the details are extras that the target doesn't need or care about. Does that mean you can\ngo in unprepared? Not at all. You should still be prepared with some basic information about your\n“character” in case your target asks. So, I developed a pretext that followed a path like this:\nI am Phil Williams, a 40-year-old safety inspector. I have one child. I'm married. I don't have any\npets, but I love dogs and cats. I'm pretty boring; I go to work and go home. I've lived in X state\nfor X years.\nWith that very basic pretext, what knowledge do I need to know to make sure I can pull it off?\nName of wife\nName of child\nAge of child\nThe state\nThe city within that state\nMy job role and what I do for the company\nThat's basically it. Maybe there are a couple more tidbits that are worth planning, but for the most\npart, these basics are all I'd be asked to reveal.\nLet me give you an example of a time when someone didn't know when to reel it in on the pretext: I\nwas once working with a student on a homework assignment. He'd had a failure at approaching a\nstranger the night before, and to help him build confidence in the wake of that failure, we went to\nthe hotel lobby so I could watch him engage with a stranger. My goal was to watch him engage to see\nwhere he was going wrong and then offer advice on how to “fix” it.\nThe student walked up to a woman and started off so nicely. He had a warm smile, and he was really\nfriendly looking. The woman started to engage with him, and I saw her body language change to\nwarm and friendly with her hips turned toward him. (You'll read more about body language in\nChapter 8, “I Can See What You Didn't Say.”) The student asked the woman where she was from,\n70\nand she responded with a smile, “Philadelphia.”\nHe says, “Oh really? That's amazing. Me, too!” Unfortunately, nothing was further from the truth. As\nI heard those words come from his mouth, I saw the train wreck starting in slow motion.\nThe woman replied, “Well, that's amazing! Where do you live?”\nThe student realized that he had just shoved not only a foot in his mouth but his whole leg. He\nreplied, “Umm, you know. By that big bell thing …” His voice trailed off because he knew he was\nabout to be hit head-on.\n“The bell thing?” she asked. “You mean the Liberty Bell?”\n“Oh, yeah. That is what I meant … ,” he said sheepishly.\n“First of all, I don't know what your game is, but ‘bell thing’? No one from Philly would call it the\n‘bell thing.’ And secondly, there is no housing near the bell thing. This conversation is over.” She\nturned and walked away.\nThe student came over to me and said, “Man, that is basically my last two nights.”\nI asked him to tell me in detail how the last two nights' conversations went. As he described the\nconversations, the problem became clearer to me: he just agreed to whatever the target said without\nhaving the knowledge to back it up.\nHe took the lesson on “tribe mentality” (which I discuss in detail in Chapter 5, “I Know How to Make\nYou Like Me”) to mean he needed to join whatever tribe the target said they were in, and they would\nautomatically love him.\nFOR YOUR INFORMATION\nSo you don't have to wait until you read Chapter 5 to get the lowdown on tribe\nmentality, here's a brief description. Tribe mentality refers to fitting into the\ngroup (or “tribe”) of people you are approaching, whether that is with your style\nof dress, language, culture, or other aspects of your characteristics. As a social\nengineer, it is preferable for you to try and fit into their tribe instead of making\nthem try to fit into yours.\nThis student's experience is a good lesson in pretexting for all of us. It is important to have some\nknowledge of the details of your pretext. In the student's encounter with the woman from\nPhiladelphia, all he would have needed to do to become part of her tribe was to change one sentence\ninto a validating question, something like this: “Philly? I hear that's a great city to go be a tourist in.\nI've never been. What are your favorite things about Philly?” That would have told her he was\nlistening and interested and wanted to learn more—instead of pretending that he had knowledge\nthat he didn't.\nMastering this one concept can make a huge difference in the success you have with pretexting.\nAfter you are successful with the initial contact, people you interact with start to give you lots of\ndetails. All that detail can become hard to remember—which leads us to the next principle.\nPrinciple Four: Avoiding Short-Term Memory Loss\nIt happens to all of us: you meet someone for the first time, engage in a good conversation, and then,\nas you are leaving, you can't remember the person's name. This can be a real deal-breaker for some\nfolks, and it can make you appear as if you aren't interested in the person.\nI have found there are more people who have a hard time remembering the details than those who\nhave no problem at all. That is the reason this section is so important. You don't inspire confidence\nif you whip out a notebook mid-conversation to look at some details about your story. And it is even\nmore concerning to the person you are speaking to if they catch you writing down details about\nthem.\nWe have all heard the tips that say something like this: “Use the name as many times as you can in\nthe first 20 seconds of hearing it, and you will remember it.” That tip does work, but it doesn't\n71\nalways make practical sense to repeat a person's name rapidly right after hearing it. I can almost\nimagine meeting you for the first time, and as you exhale, you say, “Ah, Chris, Chris, Chris … yes\nChris … Chris is your name. So, Chris, what were we talking about, Chris?”\nUmm … creepy. Please don't do that when we meet.\nWith that said, I do find that using a person's name in some meaningful way can aid in remembering\nit. In “The 18th-Floor Escapade,” as I entered the building and headed straight for the elevator, a\nsecurity guard stopped me. She held one hand up and said, “Excuse me, where are you going?”\nI stopped, knowing I would have to enter this into the report, “Oh, I'm so sorry, ma'am.” I held my\nhand out and said, “I'm Phil Williams from “[the name of the company, which I'd prefer not to\ndivulge] headquarters. We have an office here on the 18th floor.”\nShe looked through a list she had on a clipboard and then said, “I'm sorry, Mr. Williams. I don't see\nyour name on the list of approved visitors today.”\n“You are 100% right. My name won't be there. I'm sorry—I'm so rude. What is your name?” I said as\nI looked at her name badge. “Claire, nice to meet you.”\nI paused for only a second, “See, Claire, we had an incident at one of our locations due to some\nsafety policies not being followed, and I was sent out to visit our NE offices to ensure that all policies\nare being followed. These need to be surprise visits, so we can ensure that the findings are legit.”\n“I see.” Claire said.\n“And one of the sections on this report is front-desk security. I'm happy to have your name, so I can\nreport that you followed all procedures perfectly. I have your first name—and how do you spell your\nlast name?” As I said this, I pulled out my pen, looked down at my clipboard, and wrote her first\nname on my own list.\nShe didn't even pause before she said, “Farclay. That's F-A-R-C-L-A-Y.”\n“Okay, Ms. Farclay. You have gotten this audit off to a great start. Thank you for that. Now, what I\nhope to find is that my surprise visit ends with as high marks as you will get.”\nShe then did something I had not expected. “Well, Mr. Williams, how about I badge you to 18, and\nyou can see if your surprise audit yields some positive results?” she offered.\n“Claire! Wait, can I call you Claire?” She nodded, so I continued, “Claire, you are a genius! That is a\ngreat idea.”\nWith pride, she walked her new friend (me) over to the elevator bays and used her security badge to\nopen the doors and then badge me to the 18th floor. I thanked her and said, “I will see you in 15\nminutes.”\nSo, what was the key for me in that situation?\nUsing the guard's name a few times in quick order\nHaving as part of my pretext a reason to write everything down\nFor me, although these techniques work wonders, they're not always practical. For that reason, you\nneed to have other methods in your arsenal. I employ a few different techniques:\nThe business card: Exchanging business cards with a target is a great way to get all their\ndetails. But don't start off with this—wait until you build some rapport or are leaving.\nRecording devices: I sometimes record both audio and video of live engagements and audio of\nphone engagements to ensure I capture all the details. This can be a great tool, but make sure to\nget permission from the company before you record anything or anyone on their premises.\nA partner: I find it helpful to have someone else work with me so that person can help\nremember the details while I focus on other things.\nAll these ideas are great for keeping the details safe for the report that will follow, but they are not\ntoo useful for remembering the details while you're in the middle of an engagement.\nHere are a few tips:\nPractice. As often as you can, practice remembering details where and when it's not part of\nyour job to do so—family gatherings, parties, meetings at the office, sales calls, and other times\nwhen you are engaging with someone.\n72\nChallenge yourself to remember things like the color of a person's shirt, what kind of jewelry they\nwere wearing, their full name, or other details you would not normally care about.\nFor me, memory works like a muscle. The more I exercise it, the better and stronger it gets.\nRead. I've found that spending some time reading an actual printed (hardcover or paperback)\nbook helps my memory. There's no book in particular that I suggest you use for this purpose—\njust read something that's not on a screen. I don't have science to back this up this suggestion,\nbut I can tell you that the more time I spend exercising my brain, the better it “stretches” when I\nneed it to. I have also spent time solving math problems to enhance my ability to remember\ndetails.\nMy final tip for this section is that when you have short breaks, take a few minutes to record your\nthoughts. I do this in one of two ways: by writing down the details I need to remember or by using a\nvoice-recording app on my phone.\nWhen Claire badged me to floor 18 in the elevator, I whipped out my phone and hit the recording\napp so I could speak all the details I could remember into the program. This serves two purposes.\nFirst it helps me with my reporting later. More importantly, I find that when I say the details out\nloud, it helps me recall them later.\nMy quick recording went like this:\nClaire Farclay. About 5 feet, 4 inches, blonde, medium-build security guard wearing white shirt,\nbadge, black pants. Badge on left breast area. Pictures of two dogs at security desk. Used\nclipboard. Build rapport by praising that she followed procedures. Badged me to 18 using white\nHID badge she had clipped to a retractable lanyard on her right hip. Code she entered into\nelevator pad was 4381.\nI just recalled those details from memory even though “The 18th-Floor Escapade” took place more\nthan two years ago. That's how powerful this is for me now.\nThe next arrow to add to your quiver for successful pretexting is support.\nPrinciple Five: Getting Support for Pretexting\nI want you to stop and picture the pretext I have been using in this chapter: a safety auditor for a\ncorporation. Now answer these questions:\nWhat would a safety auditor wear?\nWhat tools or supplies would a safety auditor have?\nIs there any special knowledge a safety auditor would need to have?\nThe answers to these questions are the basis for this section. Let's consider each one separately so\nwe can clearly see how this principle plays out.\nQ: What would a safety auditor wear?\nA: I've found that these types of auditors generally wear khakis or jeans, a button-up shirt, and\nsneakers or work boots. They are clean-cut.\nQ: What tools or supplies would a safety auditor have?\nA: In my research, I discovered that they have a camera, phone, clipboard, pens and markers,\npaper, a checklist, and sometimes a measuring tape (depending on the job).\nQ: Is there any special knowledge a safety auditor would need to have?\nA: The answer to that question might require a few other questions being anwered. As a safety\nauditor do I need to understand how fire extinguishers work? Do I need to understand how fire\ndoors, alarms, or other aspects of the building work? Or is it okay that I am there to just check\nthings off a list? Additionally, what should I know about the company I am trying to gain access\nto? What should I know about the company that I am pretending to be a part of?\nI was once breaking into a building with Michele, and a security guard to whom I had given a fake\nbusiness card asked me where I lived because he'd never heard of my company. I wasn't expecting\nthat question, so I pointed to the west and said, “Oh, I live over in that direction.”\nThe guard replied, “In the industrial sector? Where did you find housing there?”\nI realized that I was about to get caught, so I said, “Oh, I meant past the industrial sector. You know,\n73\nin the housing past that?”\n“I am sorry, sir. I don't mean to be a jerk, but your business card says, ‘Family Owned for 20 years,’\nand you don't even know the area where you live?” the guard questioned respectfully.\nMy fatal flaw here was not having enough knowledge of my pretext area that I could answer\nquestions intelligently.\nI could not have foreseen that I would be asked this question, so the guard definitely gets points for\nbeing aware, but I didn't make that mistake again. From then on, if I had a business card that said I\nhad been there for some period, my supporting information was ready to prove that true.\nMore often than not, though, I'd rather make things easy, so I allow my pretext to be that I am new\nin the area or from out of town. That gives me freedom to not have to know everything about the\nlocation where I am.\nIn “The 18th-Floor Escapade,” I found that having the clipboard enabled me to not just look the\npart, but it also allowed me to have the very thing I needed to support my detail recording. Because I\nlooked the part, Claire had no reason to question my motives.\nAnd that brings us to the last principle: execution. It almost seems if you follow the five preceding\nprinciples, the very last one should be easier to implement.\nPrinciple Six: Executing the Pretext\nExecution of the pretext means so much more than just applying the first five principles. By the time\nyou're executing the pretext, nerves, unforeseen events, and—the wildcard—other humans are\nthrown into the mix, which means anything can happen.\nI have been doing this now for close to a decade, and I still get nervous for every gig—whether it's\nwalking into a place or picking up the phone or clicking Send on an email. Did I forget something?\nWill they catch me? Will I fail? These questions always race through my mind as I am starting off.\nThe following things help me execute the pretext more easily:\nPractice\nStretch and breathe\nCommunicate\nDo not use a script\nIt is important to remember that even with all the previous preparation there is still the unknown\nfactor: the very observant employee, the overzealous guard, or the locked door you didn't plan for.\nIn other words, you have to be prepared to be flexible.\nPractice\nIf it is a phishing email, I make sure to send it to myself and some colleagues to get feedback. I also\nlike to have my colleagues click the link or open the document to ensure everything is working.\nWhen I'm vishing, I make sure I have all supporting background sounds, information, and details\nready on my screen. I also do a test call to ensure my spoofing is working. When I'm SMiShing, I\nsend the message to another cell phone or myself to ensure it is formatted correctly and the link\nworks. And if I'm impersonating my way into a building, I practice my opening lines and make sure I\nhave my details solidly fixed in my mind before I even get in the car. I also ensure all my cameras\nand any other equipment or tools are working.\nAs Paul Kelly, a protégé of Dr. Ekman (who was introduced in Chapter 2), once taught me: “Perfect\npractice makes perfect.” Practice doing it right, so your muscle memory is ready to snap into action.\nPractice can make the difference between success and failure. At one of my jobs, after arriving at the\nlocation and grabbing my equipment from the trunk, I flipped the switch and discovered the camera\nhad dead batteries. I ended up having to use the camera on my cell phone. I remember walking into\nthat building, and all I could think about was whether my phone would work, if it would keep\nrecording, or if it would be huge tell that I was holding my phone in a very conspicuous way.\nStretch and Breathe\n74\nThis might sound silly, but I spend just a few moments taking some deep breaths and stretching.\nAdditionally, depending on how nervous I am, I might spend a few minutes in a power pose to help\nbuild some confidence before I execute my pretext and attack. (You'll read more about power poses\nin Chapter 8.)\nCommunicate\nAs a professional social engineer, I make sure I communicate to the proper degree with my client.\nFor example, the day before I launch a phishing campaign, I tell our point of contact that I am\nphishing the next day. (Of course, if I'm running a full black-box pen test, I only communicate this\ninformation after completion.) I do the same for vishing campaigns. This is especially important\nwhen I'm doing an impersonation gig. I will make sure my point of contact knows when it will occur,\nso that if there are complications, there is someone I can contact.\nI got caught during one engagement. Well, that's not entirely true—the client wanted me to tell\nsecurity that I was a pen tester after I had been successful. I told the client repeatedly that this was a\nterrible idea, but they insisted. It went something like this:\nAfter successfully walking through security as a trash compactor repairman and gaining access to\nthe whole facility unsupervised, I was leaving and said, “Sir, I just need to tell you before I leave,\nmy name is not Paul as my ID says. It is Chris, and I am what you call a pen tester. I was testing\nthe security of your building and the policies for entry.”\nAs I spoke I saw the security guard's face change to anger, and his hand went to his side where he\nhad was a stun gun. He said, “You are what? Am I getting fired?”\nI tried to calm him down by saying, “Sir, no one is getting fired. This was just a test, so we can\nhelp your company employ new policies to tighten security.”\nHowever, he was already on his radio, calling the head of security, and he hit a button to lock the\nmantrap so I couldn't escape.\nThe head of security came out. The man I had just duped explained the situation in a very\nderogatory and angry way. I tried to interject, and the guard snapped, “No one is talking to you,\nPaul or Chris or whatever you say your name is.”\nI said, “I'm going to pull a letter out of my pocket that you should read.” I handed them the “Get\nout of jail free” letter, as I like to call it. This letter is written by the client company to detail who I\nam, what I am doing, and that I have permission to do it. It also gives one or two contact\nnumbers of people to back up my story.\nAfter reading the letter, the head of security said, “How do I know this letter isn't a lie? Huh,\nChris?”\n“Well, that is a very good question. And to be honest, you don't. But just call one of those contact\npeople and this will all get cleared up.”, I said in my most agreeable voice.\n“I am not calling anyone on this paper. For all I know, this number rings to your crime buddies\nout in the van.” (I thought, “Darn, that is a good point, and also a great idea for a future gig.\nThanks Mr. Head of Security”.)\nHe continued, “I'm calling someone I know in corporate.” He picked up the phone and dialed an\nextension. He rattled off the story and then asked, “Do you know anything about this?”\nI could overhear the voice on the end of the line said, “I don't know anything about a pen test.\nCall the cops.”\nI was escorted to and then locked into a utility closet. (I'm not even kidding.) Fortunately, in\ntheir haste, the guards left me with my cell phone and my lock picks. In a few minutes, I was out\nof the closet, had unlocked the office door, and was sitting in the hallway calling my point of\ncontact to tell him to get this fixed now! And am I thankful I called him the night before to\nensure he was going to be in. A few minutes later, this was all squared away, and I was leaving\nfree and un-tased.\nAs this story illustrates, you have to make sure you communicate with the right people about the\nright things at the right time. I know this is vague, but that's because the requirements and rules\nchange per job, per task, and per client. Some clients require significantly more hand-holding than\nothers. Just remember, you are an SE professional, so you must ensure your clients are happy.\n75\nDo Not Use a Script\nThis advice is mainly directed to you Cs on the DISC chart, who want a ton of detail and every step\noutlined. (Chapter 3 covers the DISC profile and what a C is in detail.) Having a script, whether for\nvishing or impersonation, removes your ability to be dynamic. I guarantee you one thing: nothing\nwill go exactly as planned. Having the ability to be dynamic gives you a leg up and a higher success\nratio.\nSummary\nI suggest you spend time reviewing the six principles of pretexting, so you can better perfect them.\nRemember that each principle builds on the next principle and will help you become a stronger\nsocial engineer in the process.\nPlanning your goals efficiently can help you come up with reality-based pretexts that keep the target\nin beta mode (refer to Dr. Langer's research in Chapter 1). Using reality rather than all fiction will\nmake it easier for you to stay in pretext and make it easier for the target to believe you. Having your\npretext firmly based in reality helps you determine how far you should go for that particular job, so\nyour effort is at the right level and not too much or too little. Keeping it simple also helps boost your\nmemory retention for not only the facts of your pretext but also whatever information you obtain (so\nyou can recall it easier). All this planning makes it easy to decide what outfits, gear, and tech you\nneed to support your pretext. If you have made it this far, you can easily execute the pretext.\nPlease remember that your pretext can make or break your whole engagement. Just imagine if you\nhad gone with me to those warehouses, but you had shown up with a smart business suit and a\nbriefcase. Does that fit the identity of a trash compactor repairman?\nThat example might be extreme, but I want you to get the point. If you start to sense that you are\ngetting caught, you will get nervous. And nervousness will wreck your smoothness, your memory,\nand your ability to think quickly.\nThe pretext, when done right, helps answer those four questions I spoke about in Chapter 3: Who\nare you, what do you want, are you a threat, and how long will this take? But there is another\npurpose of those questions that needs to be addressed, which is the topic of Chapter 5, and it has to\ndo with building rapport.\n76",

    "summary": "The text discusses the importance of understanding and adapting to a person's communication style when engaging in social engineering. It emphasizes the need to communicate on their level, avoid overcomplicating the process, and focus on building trust through genuine interaction. The main idea is that using DISC as a tool can help social engineers better connect with their targets and increase the chances of success. The text also highlights the key principles of pretexting, including thinking through goals, understanding reality versus fiction, knowing how far to go, avoiding short-term memory loss, getting support, and executing the pretext effectively."

    "text": "5\nI Know How to Make You Like Me\nRapport is the ability to enter someone else's world, to make him feel that you understand him,\nthat you have a strong common bond.\n—TONY ROBBINS\nOilHater was the nickname of a person who truly hated the oil industry. This man, who was very\neducated and well spoken, articulately explained on blogs and forums how awful fracking was to the\nenvironment and how it was going to ruin the earth for future generations. As his posts gained\npopularity and he gained a following, more and more anger was evident in his posts.\nNOTE\nNames in this example have been changed for security.\nAfter months of building his reputation, OilHater started to threaten violence. Posts started to\ndiscuss how blowing up fracking stations might be the way to go to stop these heinous attacks on\nMother Nature. He even mentioned a few fracking stations in certain areas of Texas that he would\nlike to target.\nAt this point, Paul started appearing in forums all over the Internet that spoke about the dangers of\nfracking. Paul was a concerned father of two young kids. A huge oil company started fracking in his\narea, and he wanted to know how to protect his kids from any potential harm.\nThe forum was full of helpful people who offered Paul advice on what to do and how to protect his\nfamily from damage to water sources and soil. Paul kept posting to the forums, asking questions that\nan unknowledgeable person would ask.\nOne day, OilHater answered a message from Paul with extensive knowledge, even correcting a few\nerroneous posts from other forum members. Paul thanked OilHater for helping him work through\nsome of the confusing information he had received from multiple posters. Paul then complimented\nOilHater's knowledge by asking if he worked for the oil industry because he seemed to know so\nmuch about it.\nOilHater explained that he was just a very concerned citizen who had spent hours educating himself\non the damage the oil industry was doing. Paul asked if he could private message OilHater with\nsome personal questions. During that private conversation, Paul shared with OilHater that he was\nfrom Texas and that he was very curious about that area and asked if it was as dangerous as\nOilHater had mentioned in his previous answers.\nOilHater chimed right in and knew all about that area and how dangerous it was. Paul continued to\nprobe about what could be done. It seemed as OilHater got angrier, Paul became angrier. Paul\ncontinued to treat OilHater as the expert on these matters and continued to ask questions.\nPaul grew outraged that there was nothing that could be done to stop the fracking operations and\nsave his children. He jokingly said in one conversation, “It seems like the only way to stop them is to\nblow them off the face of the earth. Too bad we can't.”\nOilHater replied, “Don't be so sure.”\nPaul enquired what OilHater meant by that, but OilHater went silent for a bit. Paul continued to\npost on the forums about how upset he was and that the area where he lived in Texas was under\nsiege by the oil industry.\nAfter about a week, OilHater sent a private message to Paul, saying that he had a plan to help stop\nfracking and that it would help Paul's kids. Paul excitedly replied that he wanted to help but wasn't\nsure what he could do.\nOilHater told him that he had a plan but wasn't sure Paul would want to help. He then said, “It\n77\nmight be dangerous.”\nPaul said something like “I might need to take on some danger to save my kids. What do you have in\nmind?”\nOilHater said, “Sometimes our hands have to get dirty to clean up a mess. Do you agree?”\nPaul replied, “I get that. I just don't want my kids to end up with cancer or worse, and those crooks\nare making millions and don't care about the suffering of us little guys.”\nOilHater replied, “Do you remember how you said once that the only way to stop them would be to\nblow them off the face of the planet? We are going to make sure they can't frack for a while.”\nPaul said, “I'm curious now. I've never done anything like this, but my kids deserve better. What do\nyou think we can do?”\nOilHater said, “Are you familiar with Peg's Diner downtown?”\nPaul replied, “Yes, I go there often.”\nOilHater said, “Can you meet me there Thursday night at 7:30 p.m.?”\nPaul answered, “Yes, sure. But how will I know who you are?”\nOilHater said, “Come to the diner and sit in a booth in the far back corner. Wear a baseball cap. I\nwill approach you.”\nPaul put up some resistance at this point and said, “I'm sorry, but that seems a little weird. Can I just\nget your name? My full name is Paul Wilcox, and I live at 123 Main Street. I just want to know who\nI'm dealing with.”\n“Sure, sorry for being so secretive,” OilHater replied, “I'm just used to being anonymous online. I'm\nRobert Moore. I'll meet you at Peg's at 7:30 in that booth.”\nAt 7:30 that Thursday night, Robert was met not by Paul Wilcox but by a member of law\nenforcement who ensured his plans could not come to light.\nIf you haven't guessed by now, I was Paul Wilcox. This three-and-a-half-week project defines the\nvery essence of what this chapter is about: how building rapport with your targets can get them to\ntrust you. For the rest of this chapter, I will refer to this as Operation Oil.\nThis chapter is based on the 10 principles that Robin Dreeke outlines in his 2011 book, It's Not All\nAbout “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone. Although Dreeke\nwas writing about everyday communications, I will show you how you can apply these principles to\nsocial engineering as well.\nBefore I get started with the 10 principles, I need to talk a little about something I did in Operation\nOil that allowed me to start building rapport. It's something so basic but so profound that if you do\nnot do this, you will most likely fail.\nThe Tribe Mentality\nAs a social engineer, you must establish that you are a part of the target tribe before you can even\nbegin building rapport. A tribe is simply what identifies a certain group—maybe it is a style of\nclothing, a group task, an attitude, or shared interest. The commonality among the members of the\ngroup creates the “tribe.” To establish yourself as part of a tribe, you need to figure out what aspects\nyou need to mirror to become part of that tribe.\nIt might be easy to imagine how this works if you think back to high school. The clothing you wore\nquickly identified you in the tribe.\nThere's a video titled “The Tribe Mentality – THE BYSTANDER EFFECT”\n(https://vimeo.com/265364702) that demonstrates how important being part of the right tribe is\nfor all of us. In the video, actors are dressed in non-business attire and lie on the ground, calling out\nfor help, in busy subway stations where business people travel. During one session in London, the\nactor lay on the ground for more than 20 minutes before anyone came to his aid.\nBefore you judge any of the folks who passed by the actor without helping, think about the scenario.\nA man in jeans and a T-shirt, and a jacket, is lying on the ground in the middle of a subway station,\nand he's calling out for help as he holds his stomach. Now try to answer the four questions (which\n78\nwere introduced in Chapter 3, “Profiling People Through Communications”) from the perspective of\na person passing by this actor, without knowing they are an actor.\nWho is this person? You just don't know. Maybe he's a drug addict? Or maybe a scam artist?\nIs he really sick? Can I get sick if I help him?\nWhat does this person want? Maybe he wants money. And maybe you really want to help,\nbut you're late for a meeting. Or maybe this man just wants you to stop so he can steal your\nwallet or your kidneys.\nIs this person a threat? What if this man is a thief or drug addict, and when you kneel to help,\nhe shanks you in the liver? Or what if he is really sick, and it's communicable?\nHow long will this take? This man isn't holding a jar for money, so this may take a while.\nWhat if you have to get this man to the hospital, and it takes all day?\nThere are legitimate reasons why a passerby would not be able to answer those four questions,\nwhich would make him or her hesitant to lower their shields and help the actor. Later in the video,\nthough, the scenario is changed a bit. The same actor is dressed in a suit and lying on the ground.\nGuess how long it took to get help? About six seconds. When the people who stopped to help were\ninterviewed, they said things like: “Well, he was in a suit, so I wanted to help.” And, “He must have\nbeen really sick to lie on the ground in a suit.”\nThe only thing that changed about the situation was the actor's clothing, but that one alteration\nallowed the passersby to have different answers to the four questions:\nWho is this person? He is one of us, and he needs help.\nWhat does this person want? He wants help, and I should give it to my fellow\nbusinessperson.\nIs this person a threat?\nObviously not, because he is well dressed.\nHow long will this take?\nIt doesn't really matter, because he is one of “us” and he needs my help.\nThe suit and the location put the actor in the right tribe to get help. Tribe mentality is that strong.\nThink about it: Nothing really changed that could provide clearer answers to three of the four\nquestions. The passersby didn't really know who the man on the ground was, how long helping him\nwould take, or if he was a threat. They knew only that he wanted help.\nIn the Operation Oil scenario, I was a concerned citizen who grew angrier and more hateful toward\nan industry that the target already had hatred for. The more knowledge I was given, the more anger\nand hopelessness I exhibited, which is what put me in the same tribe as OilHater.\nBoth Operation Oil and the “Tribe Mentality” video support the power of the pretexting I discuss in\nChapter 4, “Becoming Anyone You Want to Be.” The pretext helps tremendously to get you into the\nright tribe. Once you are in the tribe, there are 10 principles of rapport-building that can keep your\ntarget talking to you for as long as you want.\nBuilding Rapport as a Social Engineer\nHow would you define rapport? When I ask this question in my class, I get a slew of different\nanswers. Many students use words and phrases like “developing relationships,” “trust,” and “making\nthem comfortable.” I really like the definition of rapport that I have been using for a few years that I\ncombined from a few differing defintions:\nBuilding a bridge for communication based on trust and common interests.\nBuilding a bridge is a nice mental picture for me, and the 10 principles of rapport discussed in this\nchapter do just that. They allow the person you're interacting with to feel comfortable as you cross\nover that “bridge” into their tribe. Before I tell the back story to how these 10 principles came about\nyou need to understand why trust is so powerful.\nThe Moral Molecule\n79\nIn episode 44 of The Social-Engineer Podcast, I was privileged to have Dr. Paul Zak as my guest. As I\nmentioned in Chapter 1, “A Look into the New World of Professional Engineering,” Dr. Zak wrote\nthe amazing book The Moral Molecule: How Trust Works (Dutton, 2012). In this book, Dr. Zak\nwrote about his research into oxytocin. For many years, oxytocin was ignored by researchers, but Dr.\nZak decided he would figure out how it gets released into the bloodstream and what happens when it\nis.\nDr. Zak found many reasons oxytocin could be released into the blood, but all of them have to do\nwith trust and the emotions involved. One anecdote he relates on that podcast is about a time when\nhe was the victim of a classic scam called the Pigeon Drop. When he was a young man, Zak worked\nin a gas station. One day, a patron came in to report that he'd found a box of jewels in the bathroom.\nAs this “good citizen” was turning over the box to Zak so he could put it in the gas station's lost and\nfound, the phone rang. On the phone was a frantic man looking for his box of jewels. The caller was\nso elated that his jewels had been found, he offered a $200 reward to the honest man who had\nturned them in.\nThe man who found the jewels said he couldn't wait for the owner to arrive with the reward money,\nbecause he needed to be at a job interview. So, the caller suggested what appeared to be an amazing\nsolution: Zak could simply remove $100 from the gas station's cash register and give it to the man\nwho'd found the jewels. When the reward came in, Dr. Zak could keep $100 for himself and replace\nthe $100 he took from the till. The scam-artist caller made Zak feel like he was part of a tribe by\ntrusting him with two things: a share in the money prize for finding the “jewelry” and the\nresponsibility of making someone else happy. He was scammed by this dynamic duo.\nIt wasn't until Dr. Zak was doing research for his book that he realized what that scam artist had\ndone. When the caller made Zak feel like he was part of a trusted and special group, Zak's brain\nreleased oxytocin, which caused his brain to associate a positive feeling with the caller. So, when the\ncaller requested that Zak give the man who found the jewels $100 out of the cash register, he happily\ncomplied.\nThe power of trust can make a person do something they instinctively know is not the best thing to\ndo.\nWhen you apply the 10 principles of rapport building that I cover in this chapter, you help the brain\n(both yours and your target's) release oxytocin. That release makes the target feel trust toward you.\nThe thing that amazes me about Dr. Zak's research is that those feelings can return later just\nbecause someone thinks about or deals with the reason the oxytocin was originally released (which\nwill be you, if you've been successful in developing rapport with your target).\nAnother important chemical is the neurotransmitter called dopamine. As René Riedl and Andrija\nJavor noted in an article titled “The Biology of Trust: Integrating Evidence from Genetics,\nEndocrinology, and Functional Brain Imaging” (Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, &\nEconomics, 2012, http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2011-27428-001), dopamine is the main\nneurotransmitter associated with how our brains reward us. The article also notes that the\ncombination of dopamine and oxytocin is critical in creating social settings. In essence, dopamine\nand oxytocin contribute to the processes that build trust as well as reinforce positive social\ninteractions.\nAre you seeing the importance of understanding the role of both dopamine and oxytocin? If you can\nlearn how to properly use rapport and trust, you can build a bridge between yourself and your\ntarget. Developing that relationship will result in your target feeling happy (and better for having\nmet you), which will, of course, lead to a stronger bond.\nThe 10 Principles of Building Rapport\nFor episode 20 of The Social-Engineer Podcast, I was out of town at a training gig. I was set up in\nthe hotel to record the podcast, but the guest I had planned canceled on me at the last minute, which\nwas going to ruin my record of always releasing the podcast on every second Monday of the month. I\nthought, “Who has joined us in the past who was a great guest and is someone I can call at the last\nminute to beg to be on the show?”\nI shot my buddy Robin Dreeke a quick email, told him my plight, and asked if he could step in. He\nreplied quickly with, “Yes, of course. But what topic do you want?”\nWithout thinking, I blurted out, “The top techniques to build rapport with anyone fast.”\n80\nHe said, “Give me an hour to jot down my thoughts.”\nAn hour later, we recorded the podcast that would not only become legendary but would lead to\nRobin's first book. These are the 10 principles Robin covered in the podcast and later wrote about:\nUsing artificial time constraints\nAccommodating nonverbals\nUsing a slower rate of speech\nEmploying sympathy or assistance themes\nSuspending your ego\nValidating others\nAsking how, why, and when questions\nMaking use of quid pro quo\nEmploying reciprocal altruism\nManaging expectations\nRobin's book covers each of the principles in detail. I cover them from the aspect of a professional\nsocial engineer and, when applicable, relate them to Operation Oil.\nUsing Artificial Time Constraints\nA time constraint is simply a constraint on your time during any engagement with another person.\nAdding the word artificial to it just means you are making up that time constraint—in truth, there is\nno constraint related to time. Why is this important to you as a social engineer? Think about the\nfourth question you need to answer for your targets: How long will this take?\nAn artificial time constraint does answer that question. Your artificial time constraint can be\ncompletely made up and fake, but it must be believable. When developing a time constraint, you\nneed to consider the following things:\nIf the time constraint is too quick or too artificial, it does not hold the weight it needs to. For\ninstance, consider this common question: “Can I talk to you for one second?” Any person you\nspeak to will know that “one second” is not a real time constraint, so your request loses its\nvalidity.\nThe time constraint must also be realistic for the pretext you chose to use. For example, if you\nengage with a person in the grocery line, there is a built-in time constraint: when you get to the\nend of the line. You don't need to work hard to make a time constraint, you just need to work\nwithin the time constraint you have.\nIn Operation Oil, I was able to use the built-in constraints of private messaging on forums as a form\nof time constraints. If I had included a long diatribe of my “personal feelings,” my target would have\nhad to commit to reading them all before we developed a relationship. By keeping my messages\nshort and to the point but emotional, I was able to limit the time that was needed for the target to\nreply to me, so OilHater did not feel pressured to get too involved until we built rapport. The more\npersonal and invested our conversations got, the longer the messages became.\nAccommodating Nonverbals\nThis principle is simple to understand, but it's hard to implement it until you practice.\nAccommodating nonverbals means that your nonverbal body language needs to match the pretext\nyou are using.\nSuppose that you are at your favorite department store with your young child. As you're shopping, a\nperson who looks a little rushed approaches you and says, “I'm heading to a party, and I'm really\nlate. It's for my nephew, who's about the same age as your son. I forgot to buy a present. Can you tell\nme what kids his age like?”\nAs you picture this scene, answer this question: Where should the person who approached you be\nfacing? Forget about whether social engineering is involved.\nShould this person be facing toward your kid? Nope—that's creepy. A person who faces your kid\nwould probably set off all sorts of nonverbal radar flares and make you defensive.\n81\nShould the person face you? That would be less creepy, but it's not truly congruent with what said\nthe person is saying. Therefore, it could seem aggressive.\nIt would make the most sense if the person was facing toward the store items or the door, because\nthey're in a rush. That is how nonverbal body language accommodates what is being said.\nWhen nonverbal body language matches what is being said, the target can answer the third question\n—“Are you a threat?”—and allow rapport to be properly built.\nHere's the reason I said this principle is hard to implement: I've been doing this for more than a\ndecade, and I still get very nervous before every vishing or impersonation job I do. If you're like me\nand most other folks, nervousness makes you tense. And that tension makes your muscles rigid and\nstiff. If your pretext doesn't involve tension or pressure, then your nonverbals will not accommodate\nyour pretext. (Chapter 8, “I Can See What You Didn't Say,” goes into more detail regarding\nnonverbals.)\nIn essence, it's hard to combat your own emotions while trying to maintain realism in your pretexts\n—at least for those of us who aren't sociopaths. And because I'm writing this book for those of you\nwho are not sociopaths but are fledgling professional social engineers, controlling your nonverbal\ncues might not always be easy.\nFUN FACT\nA sociopath does have a conscience, according to Michael Tompkins, EdD, who is\na psychologist at the Sacramento County Mental Health Treatment Center. But a\nsociopath's conscious is weak. A sociopath can easily justify the wrong he does as\nlong as it benefits him, and he lacks empathy, which is one of the key building\nblocks of human communications.\nI don't suggest that you script the nonverbals for your engagement, but I do suggest that you at least\nunderstand clearly what would be normal for the pretext you are choosing and then have that in\nmind before you launch.\nThis advice is not just for in-person social engineering—it also applies to any vishing you do. Poor\nposture can lead to tension in the muscles of your voice box or larynx, which can affect vocal quality\nand increase the strain on your voice. If your posture is poor or your tension is high, this can easily\ncome across in your voice and lead to you not building rapport.\nIn Operation Oil, I did not have to worry about this principle.\nUsing a Slower Rate of Speech\nWhat happens if you try to talk too fast about a topic that you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with?\nYou may stutter or stumble over words. Additionally, you may find yourself using word whiskers,\nwhich are expressions like “um,” “like,” and other short, filler words. This can cause your listeners to\nthink you lack knowledge and confidence.\nHowever, if you speak too slowly, listeners might view you as lacking knowledge or as being\ncondescending. You must strike a balance between too fast and too slow.\nHow can you determine the perfect speed at which to talk during an engagement? It's as simple as\nR.S.V.P.:\nR: Rhythm\nS: Speed\nV: Volume\nP: Pitch\nTry to listen to and match the person you are communicating with. The other person's R.S.V.P. will\ngive you a good indication how you should be communicating.\n82\nWARNING\nWhen I say you should pay attention to the other person's R.S.V.P., I don't mean\nthat you should try to match his or her accent. It doesn't matter how good you\nthink you are at accents, unless you have a dialect coach at your beck and call to\nhelp you perfect the little nuances, it's better to not even try. Getting caught doing\na bad accent is a rapport killer, and it's also insulting. However, you can try using\ncolloquialisms that can make you sound a local. For example, what someone in\nthe United States calls a subway, the British call a tube. What I call a hoagie,\nsomeone from Boston calls a grinder. Learning the local lingo can help you to\nblend in while you use R.S.V.P. to pick the perfect speed.\nThis is another principle to keep in mind as a social engineer, and it matches well with the last\nprinciple. You not only want to notice the R.S.V.P. of your target, but you should also make sure it\nmatches your pretext. If your pretext is that you have an upcoming interview with HR, which would\nprobably stress you out, it wouldn't really match if you seemed as calm as can be and were speaking\noverconfidently.\nEmploying Sympathy or Assistance Themes\nThere's a fascinating study called “Mirror Neuron and Theory of Mind Mechanisms Involved in\nFace-to-Face Interactions: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Approach to Empathy” that\nwas conducted by researchers Martin Schulte-Ruther, Hans J. Markowitsch, Gereon R. Fink, and\nMartina Piefk (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17651008). It discusses the effect that an empathy-\nbased request for assistance has on a fellow human. The study makes the point that just viewing\nsomeone who's making an emotional request can trigger areas of the brain related to first-hand\nemotional pain experience.\nIn other words, if the sympathy or assistance request is handled properly, the person being asked\nwill have a strong emotional connection to that request. That connection can make it next to\nimpossible for the person to refuse to help.\nMarketers know this, which is why many campaigns include pictures and/or background music that\ninvoke certain emotions as requests are being made. Amazingly, this seems to work even if you are\nnot face-to-face with the target. Although the connection is more powerful when facial expressions\nare involved, they're not necessary to trigger the needed emotional connection. The voice or a vivid\ndescription that causes the target to picture a scene can create an empathetic response.\nThis principle is very effective for social engineers. Throughout history, conmen, scammers,\nphishers, and—even more maliciously—serial killers have used sympathy and assistance themes in\ngetting their targets to do things they should not do.\nHere's a tip that applies to all the principles, but it's especially relevant for this principle: The level of\nthe assistance you request must be equal to the level of rapport you have built. If someone you've\njust met and your lifelong best friend both ask you to help them move furniture for the day, which\nrequest are you most likely going to honor first? You're probably going to choose to assist your\nlifelong friend first because the level of rapport you have with a person helps you make the decision\nto devote time and effort to helping. If someone with whom you have no rapport requests assistance\nthat's too personal or too great, it has the reverse effect of building rapport and can make you\nsuspicious.\nLet me use Operation Oil to help solidify these points. At first, my sympathy and assistance request\nmerely involved going to the forums and asking for help with understanding fracking because I was\nworried for my kids. This request was not pointed at my target—it was a general plea for help.\nAfter OilHater proved himself to be the “most knowledgeable” source of information on the topic, I\nstarted to make direct requests to him for assistance. The more we spoke and the stronger our\nrapport, the more detailed and personal my requests became. Eventually, I was able to apply a very\npowerful derivative of this principle, referred to as “reverse social engineering.” In other words, I\ndidn't have to apply any social engineering principles to gain compliance—the rapport I built with\nOilHater almost forced him into continually trsuting me and giving me more details.\n83\nDr. Zak said that oxytocin (the trust molecule) is the strongest when you make the target feel they\ncan trust you. It is this trust that creates the bond. It is very powerful, and it's an important factor\nwhen you're ready to make a request of a target. I was able to apply this principle during Operation\nOil, and when OilHater finally trusted me enough to request my help, when his level of trust reached\na point where he came to me to share his ideas—that is when our “relationship” was set in stone. By\ncontinually asking OilHater for more and more assistance in understanding the problem and\npotential threats and then coming to his aid when he needed help, I had developed a very strong\nrapport with him.\nSuspending Your Ego\nThis one principle of rapport is so powerful, if you can master it, you might be unstoppable. But it's\nnot nearly as easy to do as you might think.\nTo understand why mastering this principle can be difficult, let me first define ego suspension. True\nego suspension is literally letting go of your ego—your need to be first, to be correct, or to be\nperceived as smart—and your knowledge of what is right and wrong. When you suspend your ego,\nyou set all that aside for the other person, and it's not something you can easily fake.\nWhy is this so powerful, yet so hard to do? Often, people feel weak if they must admit they don't\nknow something. And how are weak people often portrayed? In media, movies, music, and other\nforms of entertainment, people who are humble or meek are often viewed as victims. In my opinion,\nthese general perceptions make practicing suspension of ego a difficult principle to apply. No one\nwants to be perceived as weak.\nHere's an example to help you understand why it's hard to fake this: You're standing in a line at the\ngrocery store, and you overhear a conversation in which someone says, “I heard from a very reliable\nsource that if you want to cure yourself of all allergies, all you need to do is wash your face with a\nblend of milk, honey, and spring water three times a day.”\nMany people may know that statement has no scientific validity. What was your reaction when you\nread that statement? If you thought something like, “That is one of the dumbest things I have ever\nread,” or “These people need to be set straight,” then you weren't applying ego suspension.\nSuspending your ego would mean hearing someone's thoughts on a matter and reacting with, “This\nis their opinion, and they are entitled to have it, so let me try and understand their point of view.”\nEgo suspension requires you to consider someone else's thoughts, statements, and opinions as the\nright of that person—regardless of whether or not you agree with them. It also involves having the\nability to disagree without being disagreeable.\nA PRESIDENTIAL EXAMPLE\nA truly amazing example of ego suspension was exhibited by former U.S.\nPresident Ronald Reagan. During Reagan's second run for the presidency, many\nnews outlets questioned his ability to serve another term as president of the\nUnited States, because he was “too old.”\nReagan could have debated, argued, or tried to prove his critics wrong by using\nsound reasoning. However, arguing a point of contention can often be like adding\nfuel to the fire. The harder you fight it, the more it seems to prove the naysayers\nright—at least in their minds. Instead, President Reagan decided to be the first to\nbring up his age by using self-deprecating humor. He would make jokes about\nhimself like, “I remember when a hot story broke, and the reporters would run in\nand yell, ‘Stop the chisels!’” He would intersperse this type of humor throughout\nspeeches and press conferences.\nThe press wanted to complain that Reagan was too old to serve as the president.\nHowever, by bringing up the topic before the press could, Reagan was able to take\ncontrol of the situation in such a way that if the press brought up his age after he\nhad already done so, they'd look like fools. Instead of being upset, he suspended\nhis ego and used humor to shut down their arguments.\n84\nIn Operation Oil, I was able to apply the principle of ego suspension by acting like I had no\nknowledge about fracking and the oil industry (although I didn't have to pretend too much).\nAdditionally, by not questioning the things OilHater said about how terrible, dangerous, and deadly\nthe fracking industry is, I suspended my own ego and allowed OilHater to be the “boss.” Any time\nthe social engineer can suspend his or her ego and allow the target to inflate theirs, it is a perfect mix\nfor successful rapport building.\nAnother factor in the successful application of this principle is having some knowledge about the\ntopic and the ability to ask good questions. A combination of limited knowledge and good questions\nhelps the target continue to be dominant and allows the social engineer to display ego suspension. I\nused this aspect of the principle in Operation Oil by continually asking OilHater for more\ninformation and to help me get to a deeper understanding of the little bits of knowledge I had. This\ninflated his ego as I suspended my own.\nValidating Others\nThis next principle goes hand in hand with ego suspension. Simply put, validation is agreeing with,\ncomplimenting, or endorsing someone else's statements, decisions, or choices. When someone feels\nvalidated by you, their brain releases dopamine and oxytocin, which in turn enables you to create\nfeelings of trust and rapport.\nRemember when I talked about using sympathy or assistance themes? The rule I mentioned there is\nextremely important for validation: The level of validation must be equal to the level of rapport.\nTo reinforce this point, here's an epic fail story. When I was relatively new to impersonation gigs as a\nprofessional social engineer, I entered a building that I was assigned to gain entry to and scoped out\nthe front desk and the gatekeeper. I saw that she had about a dozen pictures of her kids, and they\nwere facing out, not in. This indicated to me that she was proud of her family and wanted others to\nsee them. The pictures were of various vacations they had taken, and everyone in the photos looked\nreally happy.\nI tried to think on my feet and figure the best way to build rapport, but what came out of my mouth\nwas pretty horrendous. I looked down at one picture, pointed at it, and said, “Wow, your daughters\nare beautiful …” My words trailed off as I realized her daughters were maybe 12 and 15. I was\nmortified, and I could see she shared the sentiment.\nShe reeled back in her chair with a surprised and somewhat fearful expression that was bleeding\ninto anger. She looked at me and said, “Thank you,” but she said it sternly rather than politely. Then\nshe added, “Who are you, and what do you want?”\nAs I looked at her, I probably showed every shocked, scared, and disgusted facial expression there is\nbefore I said, “Oh, I forgot something in the car. I'll be right back.” But I never did go back—I had to\nsend another team member on a different day to complete the test.\nBesides hitting a 100% creep factor, I was also nowhere near the necessary level of rapport to allow\nme to compliment her children in that manner. A proper validation would have been more along the\nlines of, “Wow, that looks like a great vacation. Where did you go?” Or even, “That's a beautiful\npicture. I never seem to capture those great moments of my kids.”\nIn other words, in an initial conversation with a target, your rapport level will be next to nothing.\nTherefore, your validation should not be too personal.\nPRO TIP\nMake sure you understand cultural barriers when it comes to validation in the\nform of physical gifts or compliments. You can really ruin rapport if you cross a\ncultural boundary inappropriately. At the same time, understanding what may be\nimportant to the target can help you pick the right validation.\nRemember when I said how powerful validation is when blended with ego suspension? That's\nbecause when you suspend your ego and allow the other person to expand his or her ego, it's\nvalidating for them. That feeling of validation can create rapport, and when a person feels validated,\ntheir brain releases those good chemicals again (dopamine and oxytocin)—and you are the reason\n85\nfor all this good stuff.\nIn Operation Oil, I was able to continually use validation by\nSuspending my ego\nValidating the target\nComplimenting his knowledge\nListening to his advice and asking for clarifications\nAccepting his idea for “fixing” the problem\nThe more times I properly validated OilHater, the stronger the rapport between us became.\nAsking How, Why, and When Questions\nWhy are how, why, and when questions powerful for building rapport? The answer to a how, why, or\nwhen question must be more than yes or no.\nThat alone should help you see why validation is so important. Remember that it's validating to\nsomeone when you ask for their opinion and then listen to their response.\nWARNING\nWhen you employ open-ended questions, it is vital to listen to the response.\nNothing ruins validation more than if someone is giving you their opinion, and\nyou look as if you are bored or are not paying attention. This means you can't be\nthinking about your next line while they are talking.\nOpen-ended questions are good for keeping the conversation going. Many times, a short pause after\na question while you actively listen encourages the person to keep talking.\nHowever, be careful to not use “why” questions too many times in a row. If you do, you can come off\nsounding like a three-year-old child who asks “But why? … Why? … Why?” over and over. As cute as\nthey are, three-year-olds are not the best at rapport building.\nIn Operation Oil, I used how, why, and when questions constantly. I would phrase things like, “Why\nis fracking so bad for the environment?” or “How can we really stop them from ruining my home?”\nThese types of questions allowed OilHater to be open and give me all his knowledge on these topics.\nActive listening is much easier to do online than in person because you can read the paragraphs\nmultiple times and assimilate the information before replying. However, you still must work at\nbeing an active listener even when you're corresponding online. For example, my good friend Jim\nManley gets mad at me when he sends me an eight-paragraph email detailing a problem or\nsituation, and I read only one or two sentences and then reply with a question. He always replies\nwith something like, “READ THE WHOLE EMAIL, HADNAGY!!” (Yes, I censored his responses\ndrastically.) If you are like me, you need to practice active listening—even in writing.\nIn Operation Oil, I practiced active listening and used open-ended questions to keep the target\ntalking.\nMaking Use of Quid Pro Quo\nQuid pro quo is translated as “Something for something.” Think of it this way: Have you ever had\nbuyer's remorse? You spent money on something, and you were very excited. But by the time you\ngot home and opened the package, you started to think to yourself, “Did I really spend that much on\njust this?”\nThis remorse is a result of feeling that what you got really wasn't worth what you gave. One of the\nworst mistakes a social engineer can make is to leave the target feeling “buyer's remorse.” In social\nengineering terms, buyer's remorse is when the target later thinks to themself, “Man, that was a\ngreat conversation I had today with … Hmm, what was his name? Where was he from? Wait, I told\nhim my full name and date of birth, showed him pictures of my kids, and even let him see my\ndriver's license, and I don't even know his name.”\n86\nThat mental conversation can create fear and anxiety in the target because what you gave them\ndoesn't feel equal to what they gave you. Now before you get carried away, I said “doesn't feel equal”\nnot “doesn't equal.” There is a huge difference between the two.\nFor one job, I was in a store and approached a target who was with his young son. I made sure I was\nfacing toward the store shelves, and I opened by saying, “Excuse me. I'm heading to a party that I'm\nvery late for. My wife is going to kill me because I was supposed to get the gift for my nephew, who\nlooks like he's the same age as your son. What do kids that age like these days?”\nWith that opening, I established quid pro quo by giving the target the following information:\nI'm married.\nI have a nephew, so therefore I have a brother or sister with kids.\nI'm late.\nI'm heading to a party.\nI'm clueless about kids.\nIn one or two short sentences, I told the target so much that, by the time we were done and I had\nenough of his story, he would never feel that buyer's remorse because he “knew” me.\nPRO TIP\nThe information you give does not need to be real (name, number of kids, and so\non), but remember that the more fake details you give, the more you must\nremember and keep straight. For this reason, use K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Social\nEngineer) for more success.\nIn Operation Oil, I used quid pro quo a few times, but most notably when OilHater had scheduled\nour time to meet at Peg's Diner. I gave him my full name and address first to build trust and because\nI hoped that he would reciprocate. He did, which allowed me to successfully stop a potential violent\nact.\nEmploying Reciprocal Altruism\nThink of this principle in simplistic terms. A reciprocating saw works by the blade going back and\nforth, or in and out, and that's also how this principle of rapport works. You send out altruism\n(whether in word or deed) by giving something important to the target, and in return, the target\ngives something to you.\nIf you open the door for someone as they walk toward an entryway that has two sets doors to pass\nthrough, what will they almost always do? Hold the second door open for you. This is reciprocal\naltruism. How can you apply this to social engineering? If you give something of value to a person,\nhe or she will feel indebted and want to repay that gift. Now, here's a very important question: Who\ndetermines the value of the gift?\nThe receiver determines the value, not you. The connection to what is important to the target can be\nmade via OSINT, observation, or generalities, but however you do it, don't assume that because you\nvalue something, the target will likewise value it. On the other hand, if you find something that the\ntarget truly values, then their feelings of indebtedness will be great enough to ignore many a security\nprotocol.\nAs I entered one building, I approached the gatekeeper, who looked like she had been crying. I left\nSE mode for a moment and said, “Are you okay?”\nI was genuinely concerned, and she could see that, so she replied, “I came to work this morning\nwearing earrings my husband gave me for our 10th anniversary. He saved for two years to buy them,\nand I just lost one.” She started to tear up again.\nI said, “Well, maybe it's on the floor,” and I got down on the floor and started looking. She did too as\nshe said, “I've already checked, but I guess it can't hurt to check again.”\nThe sun came in through the window, and I saw a small glimmer on her shoulder. I said, “You\n87\nprobably already checked this, but I see a glimmer on the back of your shoulder. Can I just check\nagain?”\nShe leaned in, and I plucked a beautiful diamond earring off her sweater and handed it to her. Her\ntears of sorrow turned to joy as she hugged me and thanked me so many times that it got\nembarrassing.\nShe then said, “I am so terrible. I kept you here for so long. How can I help you?”\nAt that moment, I decided to get back into SE mode because I realized that any request I made at\nthis point was nearly guaranteed to be honored. “Well, you were pretty upset, so I didn't want to be\npushy. But I'm late for my meeting with HR, so I'll just grab my things and go.” I stood up, grabbed\nmy bag and folders, and walked toward the locked door. I walked as if I was going to go right\nthrough it, and as I got close, I heard the mechanical buzz of the door unlocking.\nThe gift that I had unintentionally given the gatekeeper (finding her precious anniversary earring)\nwas worth more to her than the potential embarrassment of stopping me from my important\nmeeting for something as silly as security protocols.\nIn Operation Oil, I used reciprocal altruism a couple ways. First, I listened and validated OilHater's\nknowledge. Second, I was willing to give up some of my time to meet with him in order to take care\nof the problem. Both things built trust and rapport, which led to OilHater making a decision that\nwas not in his best interest.\nManaging Expectations\nWhen you use these principles, you will see doors open that you never imagined would open. It is\nalmost like being a mind reader or a Jedi. You start a conversation, and before you know it, the\nperson is giving you their life story. The challenge is to not use these principles in your everyday life\n—you must learn to dial it back and not always be “on.” Another challenge is the sheer volume of\ninformation you may receive about people—which can be overwhelming.\nThe moment you are mid-engagement is when you need to apply this the most. Just as validation,\ntrust, and rapport release dopamine and oxytocin in your target, the same happens to you. When\nyou feel good, those same chemicals are released, and you feel the same good feelings, which can\ncause you to take unnecessary risks. If you go too far too soon, you can ruin rapport in a way that\nmight be near impossible to rebuild.\nThe other side of this coin is managing your expectations when things don't go as you want them to.\nRemember this motto: “Leave them feeling better for having met you.” If you notice that your efforts\nare leading to a lack of rapport or, even worse, negative emotions, it is best to make an excuse to\nleave and move on. You do not want to ruin your reputation as a serious security professional\nbecause your need to win is stronger than your desire to leave your clients feeling good.\nBecause these principles all work amazingly well, there's a challenge in learning to employ the\nprinciples in everyday use when not working as a professional social engineer. The challenge is not\ntreating people as a tool for your use. Part of managing your expectations is knowing that as you use\nthese principles in a non-pentest enviroment, you must often adjust the way you communicate.\nIn Operation Oil, I had to manage my expectations because it took almost two weeks before\nOilHater became one of the people posting to me in the forums. Then there was a period of time\nwhen he went silent, and I had to think about how “Paul” would react to this. Although I wanted\nOilHater to keep chatting, I had no clue if he was gone for good or just a few days. Managing my\nexpectations and being patient resulted in a successful outcome.\nThe Rapport Machine\nOne of the questions about these skills that I often get asked is how to practice them without being a\nsocial engineer yet (i.e., when you're in training) so that they come naturally when you do begin to\nuse them in professional SE. In this section, I give you some tips on how to practice and perfect the\n10 principles.\nUse the Friends and Family Plan\nYou don't have to wait to be on the clock to practice. Pick one principle, such as validation, and try\n88\nyour hand at it the next time you're at a family gathering. Observe a cousin you haven't seen for a\nwhile and then try to offer a sincere compliment. Follow that up with a question about her or his life\nand actively listen to the response. See how willing she or he is to answer.\nAt the next gathering or work event, pick another principle, such as accommodating nonverbals, and\nnotice the different ways people react to you depending on how much or little you face them. Over\ntime, you begin to develop a toolkit of what works and what doesn't, and you start putting the\nprinciples into practice even when you're not actively thinking about them.\nRead\nThere are a lot of books (like Robin Dreeke's) that talk about rapport building. You can find a pretty\ncomprehensive list on www.social-engineer.org/resources/seorg-book-list. Reading about\nthese principles reinforces them in your mind and makes it easier for you to call upon them when\nyou need to.\nTake Special Note of Failures\nWhen things don't work as planned, and a conversation takes a trip down the drain, don't try to hide\nand forget it. Instead, take special note of what happened and why.\nI've learned more from my failures than from my successes, and consequently, my successes mean\nmore because of my failures. Learning from my failures and taking special note of them enables me\nto be a better teacher of these skills as well as a better social engineering professional.\nSummary\nThis chapter walked you through how to recognize, use, and benefit from the ability to build rapport\nwith anyone. These skills are powerful when you're communicating with other people and are\nessential for you to become a professional social engineer.\nRegardless of whether you are phishing, vishing, SMiShing, or impersonating, you need these skills\nto get the maximum benefit. But I have one final note: It is just as important to learn how to\ndisengage without ruining rapport as it is to learn to build the rapport.\nI've noticed that disengaging tends to be one of the most difficult skills for my students to manage\nafter they get the principles to work, because disengaging feels bad. Your target is pouring out their\nlife story to you and telling you everything you wanted to know (as well as some things you didn't\nwant to know), and now you're just supposed to walk away?\nWell, no. You need to learn to disengage. And if you followed the 10 principles, disengaging will be\neasy. Let me give you a couple examples.\nIf I employ artificial time constraints, I can look at my watch and say, “Oh, my! I can't believe how\nmuch time has passed. You've been so engaging, I lost track of time [validation]. I'm really sorry,\nbut I have to run [ego suspension].”\nIf you employ quid pro quo and validation to build rapport, you can say, “Well, look at that! You're\nso fascinating to talk to [more validation] that I forgot I'm supposed to pick up salad makings for\nmy wife/husband on the way home. I'd better bolt [confirming the quid pro quo by giving the\ntarget the “personal” information that you are having salad tonight and you have a spouse]!”\nI find it helpful to plan a few exit strategies that fit the pretext I'm using. This gives me a validating\nand kind way to get out of the situation without having to damage any rapport I've built.\nWARNING\nIf you start using rapport-building techniques while in a closed environment—\nsuch as on a plane, train, or other public transport—be aware that you will have\nfew exit strategies. For example, if I need to use these principles on a plane, I\nusually have an artificial time constraint ready, which goes something like this:\n“I'm about to take a nap so I can work when I land, but before I do, I wanted to\n89\nask, where are you from?” I'm telling the person my goal is to not engage for too\nlong. However, after many times of failing at this and being stuck talking to\nsomeone for three hours (or nine hours on one trip!) instead of getting some\nmuch-needed sleep, I now just put headphones on and don't even make eye\ncontact.\nRapport links you to your fellow humans. As you link to more and more people, you have the choice\nto make them feel better or feel worse for having met you. In each choice you make on how to use\nthese skills you have the power to influence or manipulate the person you are talking to. That's the\ntopic of Chapter 6, “Under the Influence.”\n90",

    "summary": "The text discusses how building rapport with targets is crucial in social engineering. It uses the example of \"Operation Oil,\" where a social engineer, Paul Wilcox, used techniques like the Tribe Mentality, validation, and reciprocal altruism to gain trust and cooperation from an anti-fracking activist, OilHater. The key principles include establishing trust through empathy, matching nonverbal cues, using open-ended questions, and managing expectations to maintain a positive relationship. These methods help create a strong emotional bond, making targets more likely to comply with requests."

    "text": "6\nUnder the Influence\nThe secret of my influence has always been that it remained secret.\n— SALVADOR DALI\nThis chapter covers both influence and manipulation, but for now, I want to focus on influence. How\ndo you define influence?\nI define it as “getting someone to want to do what you want them to do.” This means that the person\nhas the idea to do what you want them to, or at least that is the way they will remember it. Because\nthe person perceives the idea as his or her own, it is a great idea, and the person is committed to it.\nOne of the greatest minds in history on this topic is Dr. Robert Cialdini. He has been researching,\nwriting about, and perfecting the art of influence for decades now. In episode 86 of The Social-\nEngineer Podcast, I was privileged to have Bob, as he asked to be called, on the show. It was one of\nthe most fascinating conversations I have had, and one that I learned so much from.\nBob wrote a book, which I still use today, titled Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (William\nMorrow and Co., 1984). In it, he discusses six principles of influence that are definable, teachable,\nand trackable. As part of my practice, I have broken Bob's six principles into eight principles.\nIn this chapter, I first define these eight principles as they have been researched and studied by\ngreat minds like Dr. Cialdini. I follow the definition of each principle by tying each to social\nengineering.\nAfter my discussion of each principle, I talk about framing, which is closely linked to influence.\nSimply put, framing is the foundation on which your beliefs, viewpoints, and thoughts are based.\nLater in the chapter, I discuss how you can alter those frames in your targets. I also discuss\nmanipulation, the darker more sinister cousin to influence, and then I summarize everything, give\nyou some tips, and send you on your way to mastering this amazing talent.\nSKILLS LESSON\nIn my career, I've had the opportunity to use my skills to help track, trap, and stop\npeople who exploit and hurt children. One case clearly helps define influence as\nstated in the chapter introduction.\nFor this engagement, which we will call OpRentalCar, we needed to get the home\naddress of someone we knew was trafficking children. Authorities had proven his\ninvolvement through other means, but he bounced around so much that his home\naddress was not clear. We knew that he was renting a car for a flight he took to a\ncertain city. The goal was to find the place from which he rented the car and try to\ninfluence the agent to give us his home address.\nMy pretext was that I was the owner of a pizza restaurant in town. My story was\nthat I had found an iPad belonging to our target in the restaurant, and I wanted to\nget it back to him, but it was locked. We knew that getting the address was going\nto be hard, so I had planned to offer free food to the rental agent in exchange for\ngood ideas about how to track down the guy.\nIt took some work, but I finally found a rental agency that confirmed the car had\nbeen rented from them. Part of my conversation with the rental agent went like\nthis:\n91\nNOTE\nFor security purposes, I've substituted fictional names for the actual rental agent\nand restaurant names.\nMe: Look, I'm in a bind here, so I've got a free pizza in exchange for any good ideas you\nmight have …\nAgent: I love Big Tony's pizza! What can I do?\nMe: Well, I would ship this iPad directly back to him, but I don't have his home address.\nSo how about if I just bring it in to you, and you ship it back?\nAgent: Tony, I can't. I'm really sorry, but we have a policy that we can't be responsible for\npossessions that we do not find inside the car.\nMe: Yeah, that makes sense. Dang. I'm not sure what to do now. What do you think I\nshould do to get this to his house?\nAgent [thinks for a few seconds, then whispers]: Look I'm not supposed to do this, but what\nif I give you his address, and you ship directly to him?\nMe: Steve, you are a genius! Why didn't I think of that? You know what? When we are\ndone, there is a $25 gift card waiting for you here.\nNotice that two times in the conversation, I interjected the idea of the agent giving me the\naddress, but then I played dumb instead of just asking for it. This is a great example of blending\nthe principles of influence while interjecting thoughts about getting the address, which made it\nseem as if this was the target's idea, which in turn made it easier for him to follow through on.\nAs I talk about the topics in this chapter, you'll notice a lot of similarities to the principles of\nrapport.\nNOTE\nI have launched a nonprofit organization called the Innocent Lives Foundation\n(www.innocentlivesfoundation.org), which is dedicated to saving children from the\nhands of predators. The foundation members are information security\nprofessionals who work closely with law enforcement in uncovering those who\ntry to hide on the Internet while exploiting children. The skills discussed\nthroughout this book are used extensively to expose those predators and help\nsave children.\nPrinciple One: Reciprocity\nThis principle is very much like reciprocal altruism in rapport building. It's based on the way\nhumans want to reciprocate to those who do kind things or give us things that we enjoy. According\nto Cialdini, even if we don't want the item given to us, our brains are unsettled until we feel that we\nhave paid back the giver. Marketers know this and use this principle all the time.\nReciprocity in Action\nThink about the last time you were at a grocery store and got a free sample. The store or marketing\ncompany that set up that sample booth knows that most people are more prone to buying the\nproduct after receiving the free sample of it.\nPeople are also more prone to comply with a command or ask after being complimented.\nI was with my wife and daughter in London on some work. We had purchased premium economy\ntickets to ride home in relative comfort. Like obedient little travelers, we arrived at the airport three\n92\nhours early.\nI had wheeled in our luggage cart, and the overflowing luggage was teetering on the edge of\ndestruction. I was approaching the ticket counter when I hit a little bump in the floor, and all our\nbags tumbled to the floor with a loud CRASH! I simply made a loud joke and said, “Accident on the\nM5!”\nBecause of my American accent, all the Brits laughed at the irony of an American using a local road\nname as a joke. A woman at the ticket counter looked up from her computer, smiled, and called us\nover. I pulled out our passports to hand them over, and my wife just started telling her how much\nshe loved her scarf.\nNow, my wife is no social engineer. She is just a naturally amazing, beautiful, and wonderful human\nbeing who truly loves people. So, she was genuinely complimenting this woman by saying things\nlike, “Wow, you did your make up so perfectly,” and, “I love how your scarf matches your eyes.”\nI was watching this interaction and seeing the nonverbal display of this woman, who was just\nbeaming with pride, happiness, and all the good chemicals that a brain can release. Instantly I\nthought, “This is your time, Chris—make the request.”\nAs I handed over our passports, I leaned into my wife, and I said to the woman, “My beautiful wife\nand I are curious—how much it would cost to upgrade us to first class for the flight home?”\nThis is no joke: The ticket agent started typing frantically. She gave us three first-class tickets for no\nextra charge, with full lounge access during the three-hour wait.\nThink about it: A few compliments that were preceded by humor and followed by a request.\nReciprocation for the win!\nMy illustration of reciprocity is in Figure 6-1.\nFigure 6-1 Reciprocity in action\nReciprocity works only when this path is followed. You can't interject the command or request too\nearly. You can only make your request after you have created those feelings of debt because those\nfeelings of debt increase the chance that the request will be honored.\nUsing Reciprocity as a Social Engineer\nYou probably have five million ideas of how to use the principle of reciprocity swimming through\nyour head. Let me just give you a quick tip: The level of request you can make is determined by the\nperceived value of the gift to the receiver.\nTake a moment to understand that. Remember, Cialdini said the target will feel like reciprocating\nregardless of whether or not that person wants the gift. If the recipient values the gift, he or she will\nfeel more compelled to return a gift of greater or equal value.\n93\nI am part of a small group of hackers who are also whiskey enthusiasts. When we meet for\ngatherings, we sometimes trade bottles of whiskey. We each bring something for the other guys, so\neach of us goes home with something different from the others. Often, we will set a theme so that\none of us doesn't bring something worth a hundred dollars while another person brings something\nworth much more. This keeps the principle of reciprocity under control, and no one feels less or\nmore indebted.\nAs a social engineer, it is imperative that you first find out what the target person or company\nvalues. You need to prepare your pretext with that in mind. When you offer the target a chance to\nhave something of value, you are more likely to succeed.\nFor example, in the assignment I spoke of earlier, OpRentalCar, I found out pretty quickly that the\ntarget really loved Tony's Pizza. Armed with that, I made the offer for free food in exchange for his\ngreat ideas. I didn't say, “If you give me [the customer's] address, I will give you pizza.” Why\nwouldn't I do that?\nThe reason is simple: At this point, we had no rapport built. Asking for something like a customer's\naddress before I build rapport with the target would have led the target to have all force fields raised,\nshields on high, and the red alert engaged.\nBy making an offer of free food, followed by interjecting what I really wanted, I allowed for the\ntarget to “come up” with the exact idea I needed.\nFUN FACT\nI didn't want the agent to go to Tony's Pizza and not receive a gift certificate. After\nI hung up with him, I called Tony's and bought a $25 gift certificate over the\nphone in his name and told them to hold them there “from Tony” for when the\nagent came in to claim them.\nHere's another situation in which I used this principle: I had to spear phish a CEO. During the\nOSINT phase, I found out that he was an avid runner who loved to run marathons. I found this out\nbecause he took tons of selfies while he was running the marathons.\nMy spear phish came from a marketing company for a recent marathon the CEO had run. The\nmessage said something like, “During the recent Run for Kids Marathon you took a part in, we\ncaptured a few photos we would like to use for marketing and promotion. We need your approval to\nuse these photos. Please click here to see the photos and approve.” If I remember correctly, the CEO\nclicked the link in less than 60 minutes after he received it.\nWhen you find what the person truly values, the target will grant the request you make with little to\nno thought.\nPrinciple Two: Obligation\nObligation sounds very close to reciprocation, but there is a small difference. Whereas reciprocation\nis the feeling of indebtedness due to a gift or something of value that creates the action, obligation is\nthat same feeling, but it's based on social norms or expected behaviors.\nObligation in Action\nI have asked the following question of students from around the globe: If you are in traffic, and you\nallow a fellow motorist to merge in front of you, what is he or she obligated to do? What must he or\nshe do?\nThe students respond that the motorist must wave, raise a finger, or give a head nod, but all those\ngestures mean one thing: The motorist must (or is obligated to) show some level of respect and\nappreciation for the kindness you just showed. What happens if they don't?\nI was in Washington, DC, driving to a meeting on a beautiful four-lane highway, and traffic was\nbeing forced to merge to one lane. The traffic was coming to a screeching halt. I was determined to\n94\nnot let it get the best of me, so I turned up the music as I inched along. Other cars were trying to\nmerge onto the highway from an on-ramp, and my fellow motorists where not feeling too altruistic.\nThey were not letting people merge. So, I slowed down and flashed my lights to let in the next guy\nwaiting to merge.\nAs he pulled in front of me, I looked in through his rear window for his obligatory head nod, wave,\nor appreciative look in his rear-view mirror. When I didn't get it, I felt my blood start to boil. My\nface got red, and I got more aggressive with my driving. I started to think, “No wonder everyone was\nbeing a jerk to you and not letting you in!”—as if the other motorists had some kind of sixth sense\nthat would allow them to see this driver was going to be unappreciative.\nI built a whole story line about this arrogant waste of flesh in front of me. When the other lanes\nopened up a few miles later, I was determined to floor it and pass the rude driver to show him who\nowned the road.\nI laid the pedal to the floor, and all six cylinders of my super-charged sports car jumped into action.\nAs I got next to the other driver's window, I looked over with disgust and saw … he had only one\narm. Talk about going from anger to humility in one second flat. I quickly smiled and waved while\ntipping my head.\nWhat is my point in telling you this terribly humiliating story? When I felt that the man had not\nlived up to his obligation to thank me, I was furious. Only when I saw that he had a valid reason for\nnot waving did I realize my error in judgment.\nTry this next time you are in a conversation with someone. As they ask you a good question, don't\nanswer or acknowledge them. Just stare at them. If they ask if you are okay, just say, “Yep.”\nI can imagine most of you are letting out a nervous weird laugh or smile right now as you picture it.\nWhy? It's awkward to think about not fulfilling the obligation of answering a question.\nObligations are powerful, especially when they relate to social norms. Figure 6-2 illustrates the cycle\nof obligation.\nFigure 6-2 Obligation in action\nAs a social engineer, you want to play into these expected reactions. Any time you don't, you reduce\nthe chance of building rapport, because the target will be wondering why you didn't act “normal.”\nUsing Obligation as a Social Engineer\nSocial engineers use social situations to create a feeling of obligation for the target to act a certain\nway all the time. For example, it's considered rude to not hold the door for a woman or for someone\ncarrying boxes or other cargo, and social engineers use that custom to their advantage.\nFor one of my jobs, I loaded a box full of heavy phones and computer parts. I waited for the lunch-\nhour rush and walked toward the doors of a place I was supposed to gain entry to. As I approached,\n95\nsome kind soul said, “Oh, let me get the door for you.”\nAs I stepped into the building, a very stern fellow employee said, “You're supposed to see his badge\nbefore you let him in!”\nI said, “He's 100% right. Hey, this box is heavy—my badge is in my front pocket if you want to grab it\nout.” I leaned my hip toward the stern man.\nHe quickly snapped, “I'm not reaching my hand into your front pocket, Buddy!”\n“Sheesh! Where's my brain?” I said embarrassedly. “That is awkward. This box weighs about 45\npounds—you want to hold it while grab my badge?”\n“Just go, man—I don't have time for this!” the guy exclaimed and walked out.\nThe door was held out of obligation. I used the policy that the stern man stated … to feign offering\nmy “pocket” out of obligation. The guy felt awkward reaching in my pocket and obliged to let me go\nunverified.\nThis scenario worked for me on more than one occasion. That is, until one day, I encountered an\nemployee who said, “In this pocket?” as she reached toward my front right pocket.\nI said, “Oh, maybe it's the other one. You can try both.” I hoped the awkwardness of the situation\nwould make her back up, but it didn't. She reached into my pocket and felt around, which, by the\nway, was very awkward for me!\nAfter finding nothing but my keys in the first pocket, the woman said, “Give me the other side.” In\nthat pocket, she found my wallet and a knife. She looked at me and said, “Could it be in your wallet?”\nI said, “I'm not sure—maybe,” even though I knew full well it was not in my wallet. She snapped it\nopen and right in the front was a picture of my infant daughter. The woman saw the photo and\nexclaimed, “Oh my God, she is so cute! What's her name?”\nWe then had a 15-minute conversation about my family while she held my wallet, knife, and keys,\nand I held this stupidly heavy box. After about 15 minutes, she just put everything back in one\npocket and said, “Well, you'd better report your lost badge to security before you get in trouble. I'll\nsee you around the office.” With that, she let me go. We had developed a rapport and friendship, and\nshe was now obligated to trust me.\nObligation is a powerful principle that can make being a social engineer much easier.\nPrinciple Three: Concession\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines the word concede as follows: “Admit or agree that something\nis true after first denying or resisting it.”\nRemember, the very definition of influence is that if a person feels ownership of an idea, then that\nperson most likely thinks it's a great idea! Concession will help the target make it “their idea” to take\nthe action you want.\nConcession in Action\nIn the area where I live, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is\nvery good at using concession to get people to donate. A solicitation call will go something like this:\nCaller: Good morning Mr. Hadnagy. This is Carrie calling on behalf of animal lovers in Montrose.\nHow is your dog doing?\nMe: [replying and realizing I'm talking about things close to me and smiling—oh no, how do I\nstop?]: She's great. Getting up there in years though.\nCaller: I'm glad she's doing good. And it is great to be chatting with a fellow animal lover. And as\nan animal lover, I need your help today. As you know, we need help to keep caring for all\nthe strays in our area. We want every animal to have a loving home like your dog does. Can\nyou help us today?\nMe: [thinking that it's almost as if I can't stop the wreck that is about to happen]: Well, I do\nlove animals. What do you need for help?\nCaller: [speaking with clarity and without wavering]: We're asking for monetary help today, and\n96\nmany people are donating about $250 to help us.\nMe: [feeling triumphant because I'm going to shut her down]: $250?! Wow, I'm sorry. I just\ndon't have that much. I would love to help, but I just can't do that right now.\nCaller: Oh, I get that. These are hard times, and that is a lot of money. How about if you help us\nwith just $25 today, then?\nBefore I know it, I've pulled out my credit card. Let's look at what happened. I agreed, or conceded,\nto a few things:\nI'm an animal lover.\nI wanted to help.\nI would help, but the first price was too much.\nWhen I was offered an alternative, I could not say no. What would have happened if the caller had\nstarted at $25? Donations might have ended at a much lower amount, but by starting at a much\nhigher value, she had almost guaranteed more donations.\nLaw enforcement interrogators use this tactic all the time. If they can get a perp to admit to even a\nminor detail, to concede to one fact, it is nearly impossible for that person to go back on what he or\nshe has said.\nCheck out these two alternatives. The detective could ask, “Were you at Lee's bar at 11 p.m. during\nthe robbery?” And the perp could easily answer with, “Nope, I was never there.” Or the detective\ncould ask, “So, at 11 p.m., what did you see during the robbery at Lee's bar?” To which the perp\nmight reply, “Well, I didn't see anything at all. It was dark.” With that type of response, the\ninterrogator knows the person being questioned was at Lee's bar at 11 p.m. The perp has made a\nconcession! By answering the question, that person admits, or concedes, to the unasked question\nabout whether he had been at the bar.\nFigure 6-3 shows an illustration of the cycle of concession.\nFigure 6-3 Concession in action\nUsing Concession as a Social Engineer\nDuring one vishing engagement, we were tasked with getting the full name, employee ID, and Social\nSecurity number (government ID) of the employees as part of the flags. We developed two pretexts\nthat I thought were solid, and then we started calling our targets.\nThe calls would go something like this:\nMe: Hi, this is Paul from IT. Is this Sally Davis?\nTarget: Yes, it is. How can I help you, Paul?\n97\nMe: Well, last night we were flashing the bios in the firmware for the RFID badging system,\nand we lost some records. Did you have any problems using your badge this morning?\nTarget: No, it let me in just fine.\nMe: That's excellent news. Well, you're lucky. Many flagged accounts had problems with\ngetting in and using the printers. I need to verify some details on your account, so you\ndon't run into any problems. It'll take about 30 seconds, okay?\nTarget: Sure, what do you need?\nMe: Just your full name, employee ID, and Social Security number.\nTarget: Err, ummm … that's a lot of really sensitive info. What was your name again? I need to\nlook you up.\nMany calls followed that pattern, and we epically failed. So, I sat back and thought about the\nprinciples of influence and made one change to the pretext. The following conversation picks up\nright after the target tells me she had gotten into the system with no problem that morning.\nTarget: No, it let me in just fine.\nMe: That's excellent news. Well, you're lucky. Many flagged accounts had problems with\ngetting in and using the printers. I need to verify some details on your account, so you\ndon't run into any problems. It'll take about 30 seconds, okay?\nTarget: Sure, what do you need?\nMe: First, I want to make sure your name is spelled right. I have your first name as S-A-L-L-Y\n…\nTarget: Nope, that's a problem. There is no E, just two Ls.\nMe: Sheesh, I'm so glad I called you. Why don't you just spell your last name, so I get it right?\nFrom there, I would then ask for department, confirm the email address, and by the time we got\ndown to employee ID and Social Security number, the people we called had already conceded to\ngiving up all that info and continued. That gave us an 84% success average for that engagement—\njust by making that one change.\nAs a social engineer, remember that you don't need to go immediately for the exact flags you need.\nGet some minor ones to help build those feelings that will lead to the person to concede and comply.\nPrinciple Four: Scarcity\n“Going out of business sale!”\n“Lowest prices ever in history!”\n“Only 10 left on Earth!”\nWhy do these statements work on us? If something is made scarce, or less available, its value\nincreases. How valuable was the cupcake when there were 20 of them? Now, how valuable is the last\ncupcake?\nScarcity in Action\nFor one DEF CON competition, I had this great idea to buy one of those rifles with the foam darts\nand hire a “sniper” who would shoot the kids in the SECTF4Kids (Social Engineering Capture The\nFlag 4 Kids) competition we hold each year. The competitors would have to solve a riddle and then\ninsert a tube into a box in the back of a room that would have a sniper in it who was shooting the\nkids. If a competitor got hit, that person had to go back out of the room and start over.\nFUN FACT\nThe competition went amazingly well, and if you want to hear how the winning\nteam of kids actually defeated us, you'll have to ask me in person.\n98\nThe rifle I bought was a Nerf CS6 Long Shot. Between the time I bought it and a few months after\nDEF CON, Nerf announced they were no longer making that particular model. They were replacing\nit with a model that many people said was inferior.\nI didn't need two rifles, so I put one on eBay for the $99 I had bought it for. On the first day, the bids\nhit $199, then $250, then $299, then $340. The final selling price was $410. That's $410 for a plastic\nrifle that shoots foam darts 50 feet! (Granted, it had a scope and four clips, and we'd made some\nmodifications, but still …)\nI can buy a real rifle for $410, so why did a plastic rifle go for so much money? Scarcity. Because that\nmodel of rifle had been discontinued and was now unique, it became extremely valuable.\nCompanies often make products, food, medicines, time, jewels, and anything of value scarce to help\nincrease the value in the consumers' eyes. Figure 6-4 shows the continuum of scarcity.\nFigure 6-4 Scarcity in action\nUsing Scarcity as a Social Engineer\nIn one job, our OSINT led us to the CEO's social media accounts, where he had been posting all\nabout his first real vacation in three years. He was taking his whole family to the Bahamas. He had\npictures of the packing, pictures of the ride to the airport, pictures of his family on the plane, and\none picture that said, “Now starts 2 weeks of paradise.”\nArmed with that knowledge as well as the name of his company's IT support company, which we had\nobtained from dumpster diving, I walked in the front door and approached Jane the gatekeeper. Our\nconversation went something like this:\nJane: How can I help you?\nMe: Hi there. I'm Paul from XYZ Company. Jeff asked me to come and take care of … [looking\ndown at my clipboard and leafed through the papers as if I was searching for something]\n… slowness on his desktop. He thinks it's a virus.\nJane: [looking at her organizer]: Paul, I don't see any record of this appointment from Jeff here.\nI'm sorry, but you'll have to come back.\nMe: Look, Jane. I don't know what to tell you. Jeff called and said he was heading to the\nBahamas for two weeks and to have this fixed before he got back, or he was gonna be ticked.\nI had to move four other appointments around to make it here today. And I have no more\ntime for the next month. [I paused for a second.] I guess that's fine. I'll email Jeff and tell\nhim he forgot to tell you and now he has to wait for four more weeks to get it fixed.\nMe: [turning my clipboard toward Jane without pausing]: Just sign here to acknowledge I told\nyou that we have no openings for the next four weeks, please.\n99\nJane: [pausing for a second as she looked at me]: Well, he has been complaining about his\ncomputer being slow. I don't want to tell him you can't come back for four weeks. Let's go.\nI'll let you in.\nAnd with that, I was in the CEO's office without supervision and compromising everything in the\nbuilding.\nBy making my time scarce, I had increased the value and the importance of taking the immediate\ntime slot now. Scarcity made Jane think that turning me away could create a bigger problem down\nthe road. That led to a full compromise of the company.\nAs a social engineer, you can apply scarcity to time, information, or even things you are giving away\nin your pretext. Scarcity will make what you have more valuable and influence the target to make\ndecisions based on that perceived value.\nPRO TIP\nI'm often asked, “How many people do you get fired?”\nAs a professional social engineer, I feel it is important to ensure my results are\nused for education rather than firing, unless, of course, we find an employee\ndoing something illegal or malicious toward a company. So, I can proudly say that\nit's rare for anyone to get fired just because they fell for one of my pretexts.\nPrinciple Five: Authority\nWhen someone with the right kind of authority makes certain statements, other people take them\nvery seriously. Here are some examples:\nIf a guy in a white lab coat or doctor's scrubs says, “Drop your pants,” you listen.\nIf a parent, teacher, or warden says, “Don't touch that!” you listen.\nIf your drill sergeant or commanding officer says, “Drop and give me 20!” you definitely listen.\nAll these people have one thing in common: They have authority over you. But what indicates\nauthority? When you walk into a room, how can you tell which person has authority?\nLook at Ben in Figure 6-5 and Figure 6-6. In which photo do you think Ben is showing authority,\nand why do you think that?\n100\nFigure 6-5 What do his face and body language tell you?\n101\nFigure 6-6 What are the signs of confidence?\nYou probably think that Ben in Figure 6-6 shows authority and confidence. In both pictures, Ben is\nwearing the same clothing, is the same age, and has the same hair style. He's the same person in\nboth photos. But in Figure 6-6, he is standing with his chest out, hands steepled, chin up, and no\nlook of fear in his face at all. All of this points to a person who is confident, and confidence makes us\nview the person as someone in authority. As a matter of fact, when I ask my students what indicates\nauthority to them, they list things like confidence, loud voice, chest out, chin up, neat clothes, direct\npersonality, and other characteristics like that.\nWhat effect does authority have on us? It gives us a level of trust in what the person says without\nthat person having to prove why we should obey them.\nAuthority in Action\nOne of the most influential studies on this topic was done by Dr. Stanley Milgram. In 1963, Dr.\nMilgram examined justifications for atrocities of war that he heard during the Nuremberg Trials.\nDuring those trials, the defense that was used was, “I was following orders.” In the study titled\n“Behavioral Study of Obedience”\n(www.birdvilleschools.net/cms/lib/TX01000797/Centricity/Domain/1013/AP%20Psychology/milgram.pdf\nDr. Milgram outlines his findings.\nDr. Milgram wanted to examine whether normal, law-abiding citizens could be coerced via authority\nto take an action that could lead to someone's harm or death. Of course, performing this type of\nresearch would have massive limitations. How could you prove that X number of people would or\nwould not have obeyed an authority figure who told them to harm another person?\nRandom citizens volunteered to be part Dr. Milgram's study. For the experiment to work, they were\ntold that there would be a learner and a teacher and that the assignments were random, but in truth,\nall volunteers were designated to be teachers.\nThe volunteers watched as the learner was strapped to a chair, and electrodes were attached to\nthem. The volunteers were told that wrong answers to questions would result in the learners\nreceiving an electric shock. The learner was never really shocked—they only acted as if the shocks\nhurt.\n102\nThe teacher (the volunteer) was shown a large box that had toggle switches that went from 15 volts\nto 450 volts in 15-volt increments. The volunteers even received a shock with a mere 45 volts, so\nthey had proof of the reality of it.\nThen a man in a white lab coat (the authority) sat and oversaw the teacher asking the questions. As\nthe learner got answers wrong, the voltage went up and up on their punishment.\nIf the teacher objected because they heard the learner suffer, the man in the lab coat was instructed\nto say only one of two things:\n“The experiment must go on, please continue.”\n“There is no permanent tissue damage. Please go on.”\nThat doesn't sound too compelling, does it? But this study showed that 65% of all teachers took the\nlearner to 450 volts!\nLet that sink in. The teachers were average, working-class people. They weren't pulled from some\npool of sadistic sociopaths. However, according to Dr. Milgram's study, 26 out of 40 (65%) of the\nvolunteers continued to increase the voltage to 450 volts because someone in authority told them to\ncontinue.\nFigure 6-7 illustrates the cycle of authority.\nFigure 6-7 Authority in action\nUsing Authority as a Social Engineer\nI always have a problem using authority directly in my social engineering pretexts. The main reason\nis because I often don't have the right knowledge, which means I get stuck and caught.\nHowever, sometimes implied authority or transfer of authority is sufficient. In one job, I found an\nonline invitation to a meeting for the financial board of our target. It happened to fall within the\nscope of our work, so I decided to use it. We performed OSINT on all the members invited to the\nmeeting and found one woman who seemed to be the authority figure. Aside from looking and\nsounding like the authority on social media, in popular employee rating sites, she had been named\nin a few reviews as being very hard to work for.\nSo, I took my partner's cell phone number and changed the name in my phone to this woman's\nname. (Let's call her Sally Smith.) I told my partner, “When you see me arguing with the security\nguard, text me this line: ‘Where the heck are you? We have been waiting 15 minutes! Get back here\nnow!'”\nI grabbed a bunch of folders and papers and tried walking right past security. I knew I would be\nstopped, because we had determined that security was very tight. It went like this:\nThe security guard said briskly, “Excuse me sir! Where are you going?! STOP!”\n103\nI stopped in my tracks, turned around with a shocked look, and said, “What? Didn't you see me\njust walk past you and go to my car? I'm in the financial board meeting on 14. I need to go now.”\n“I'm sorry sir, but I didn't see you walk past. Please show me your badge,” the guard requested,\nwith a confused tone in his voice.\nI let out a big sigh, “Okay, but I'm going to give Sally your name when I get up there and have to\nexplain why I'm delayed.” I started to pat my pockets and then said, “I don't know, I must have\nleft it …” Then my text message notification went off.\nI pulled my phone out and turned it to him. At the top of the text message screen was the name\n“Sally Smith” and the message underneath said, “Where the heck are you? We have been waiting\n15 minutes! Get back here now!”\nI said, “Do you want to call her and tell her why I'm being detained while the whole board room\nis waiting for these papers, or should I tell her the name of the guard who is stopping me?”\nHe read the text message and then looked at me and said, “I'm truly sorry, sir. I just didn't see\nyou walk past. Please, if we can just forget this—go right ahead to the meeting.”\n“If you buzz me through right now, we can forget this ever happened.” And with that, I was\ninside the fortress and roaming free.\nAuthority, even when it didn't come directly from me, made that security guard take an action that\nwas not in his best interest. Authority is a powerful motivator!\nPrinciple Six: Consistency and Commitment\nWe all want to seem consistent, which means that we want there to be agreement between what we\nsay and what we think we are portraying. This is especially true when we commit to something.\nHave you ever seen a small child commit to an answer that you know is false? (“No, I did not break\nthat lamp!”) The child stays committed to the answer that's consistent with their original response\neven when you have provided overwhelming proof of their lie.\nWhy is consistency important to us? We want to—maybe we even need to—seem like we are\nconsistent, because consistency is a sign of confidence and strength.\nConsistency and Commitment in Action\nI live in a pretty rural area, but recently a whole lot of oil and gas has been discovered in the ground.\nNow they are fracking and pumping and digging all over the county. As a result, there are a lot of\ntrucks on my road.\nI have seen a truck that's hauling tons of equipment go flying up my road at 50 or 60 miles per hour.\nThe drivers are careless and dangerous. Some of my neighbors have taken to putting hand-drawn\nsigns in their yards to tell drivers to slow down, be safe, and drive like their kids live in the\nneighborhood. If my neighbor came to me and asked to put one of these large signs in my yard,\nwhich would block my wife's beautiful flowers or my awesome car, I would decline even though I\nwant the drivers to slow down.\nIn 1966, researchers Jonathan L. Freedman and Scott C. Fraser studied consistency and\ncommitment and wrote about it in “Compliance Without Pressure: The Foot-in-the-Door\nTechnique” (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, September 1966,\nwww.researchgate.net/publication/17217362_Compliance_Without_Pressure_The_Foot-in-\nthe-Door_Technique). They went from door to door, asking people in a neighborhood to put large,\npoorly lettered signs with safety warnings for drivers in their yards. The signs would have blocked\nsome of the view of the homes. The researchers found that 83% of all homeowners declined to put\nthe sign in their yards.\nThen Freedman and Fraser made one change to their request in the next neighborhood, and they\ngot 76% compliance! You heard me, 76% said yes! What was that change? Better lettering? Pretty\nsignage? Payment for the sign? Renting of the space?\nNo, no, no, and no. The change was to the size of the sign. In the second neighborhood, they first\nasked homeowners to display a 3-inch sticker in their windows with the same message. Then a few\nweeks later, they came back around and asked homeowners to display the large, ugly sign in their\n104\nyard, and 76% complied.\nFreedman and Fraser called this approach “foot-in-the-door.” Once they had a foot in the door (the\nsmall sticker in the window), the homeowner was more willing to comply with future requests (the\nlarge sign).\nNumerous studies have been conducted since Freedman and Fraser's, and all have had the same\nstaggering results. Compliance drastically increases when the person has agreed to something\nsmaller first.\nWhen you blend compliance with the principle of consistency, it is an unstoppable force. Basically,\nwe want to be consistent and appear consistent. Our brains don't like it when we internally argue.\nSo, we dig in our heels in and stay a course, even when we know we are wrong, if we have committed\nand want to remain consistent. This is represented in Figure. 6-8.\nFigure 6-8 Commitment and consistency in action\nNOTE\nThe time element for consistency and commitment doesn't need to be a lengthy\nperiod—it can be just a few seconds. As long as the person commits to the first\nrequest, they will want to stay consistent with that request.\nUsing Commitment and Consistency as a Social Engineer\nOne of my personal rules is never break pretext unless you truly must. There has to be a pretty\nserious situation before you break pretext. That rule came about because of the story I am about to\ntell you.\nI was tasked with a multi-staged job in which I had to gain access to a set of dumpsters in a locked\narea. The dumpsters were where the company threw away their technology.\nTo get to the dumpsters, I had to bypass security, make my way to a secure area inside the campus,\ngain entry without being stopped, and be uninterrupted while I spent time looking for something of\nvalue.\nI started the OSINT phase with the goal of finding the dumpster company. The target company had\nstrict policies on giving out any info on any other vendors, but I decided to call the accounts\ndepartment to see if I could talk my way to that information. The call went something like this:\nCompany rep: Hi, this is Beth. How can I help you?\nMe: Beth, this is Paul from Professional Dumpster. We are relatively new to the area\n105\nand are trying to get some more local business. I'm wondering if I can send you a\nquick quote?\nCompany rep: Hi Paul. We do accept quotes from new vendors. Just send us a per-unit cost, and\nif the price matches, we'll request more information.\nMe: Okay, that's great. Can I have your email address to send it to please?\nCompany rep: Well, you wouldn't send it to me. You'd send it to vendors@company.com.\nMe: Oh, I see. Is there a way I can cc you so I know it made it in. I've had some serious\nproblems with people saying my quotes never showed up. I'm new to this business\nand not very technical.\nCompany rep: Oh, okay. It is beth.p@company.com.\nMe: Beth, you're a lifesaver. Look, can I trust you with something a little personal?\nCompany rep: Um, sure, I guess.\nMe: I have sold almost everything under the sun, but dumpsters is a new one for me,\nand I don't think I'm doing too good here. I am not even sure if our prices are\ncompetitive.\nCompany rep: I'm sorry, Paul. That must be hard. Ya know … . Send over that proposal, and I'll\npersonally make sure it gets looked at.\nMe: Beth, you're a lifesaver. I know this is uncool to ask, but is there any way you can\njust tell me who I'm going up against? [See, by now she has committed to helping\nme, giving me her email address and having a conversation. But was the\nrapport enough for this ask?]\nCompany rep: Paul, well … [sighs audibly and pauses] I would love to, but we have a policy on\nthis. I don't want to get in trouble, but I really wish I could.\nMe: Nah, I get it, Beth. It's just that I'm really struggling here. How about this—I'll just\nsay some of the names, and you can cough when you hear the right name:\nSuperior Waste, Excellent Dumpster, Waste Management [Beth coughs]. Beth, I\nhope you feel better—sounds like you're getting a cold!\nCompany rep: [chuckling]: Thanks, I do feel like I am coming down with something. Good luck\nto you.\nWith that information, I was able to get the right costume, gain entry to the secured location, and\nfind some undestroyed hard drives and USB devices that could have led to a full-scale compromise if\nthey had fallen into the wrong hands.\nPlaying the target's desire to remain consistent to their commitments, whether physical or mental,\nleads the social engineer to easier compliance with all the requests they make.\nPrinciple Seven: Liking\nPeople like people who are like them. People like people who like them. As tongue- or brain-twisting\nas those two statements are, it's important to understand the deeper meaning of each.\nIn Chapter 5, “I Know How to Make You Like Me,” I spoke about the tribe mentality. Now think\nabout that in the context of the statement, “People like people who are like them.” If we are similar,\nin the same tribe—comfortable and familiar—we will be liked, accepted, and trusted.\nNow, to address the second statement, “People like people who like them,” let me remind you of Dr.\nZak's research into oxytocin that I mentioned in Chapter 1, “A Look into the New World of\nProfessional Social Engineering.” It applies here perfectly. If you like someone, or make someone\nfeel they are liked or trusted, that person can't help but like you.\nBefore you say, “Well that's easy enough,” let me give you a few ground rules:\nThe liking must be genuine. You can't just fake liking someone and hope this works. Even if\nit works for the first few minutes, eventually it comes out or becomes evident that the liking was\nnot real, and that can ruin trust and rapport beyond repair.\nDo not think that compliments automatically equal liking. For a compliment to work, it\nmust be genuine and at the level of rapport you have built.\n106\nNonverbals play a huge role in this. When your nonverbals are genuine (remember my\ndiscussion of accommodating nonverbals in Chapter 5), then it is easier for someone to trust you,\nfeel comfortable with you, and therefore like you.\nThe running theme of all these things is that your expression of liking must be genuine. My good\nfriend Robin Dreeke accomplishes this by looking at each person as his or her own reality TV show.\nHe doesn't have to like your life, or the things you do, but he has enough interest to want to find out\nthe plot and how it unfolds. That desire to find out is genuine, and that genuineness comes across,\nwhich allows trust and rapport to be built and influence to be applied much more easily.\nTo help encourage this feeling, you can look for ways to give a compliment and mirror body\nlanguage and/or verbal cues (without parroting) to help the person feel warm and fuzzy toward you.\nFigure 6-9 illustrates how the principle of liking works.\nFigure 6-9 Liking in action\nUsing Liking as a Social Engineer\nIn one engagement, I wanted to tailgate in. As I was walking toward the front entrance, I knew I\ndidn't have much time to come up with a solid plan.\nA man was exiting his brand-new Kia and walking briskly toward the door. I picked up the pace and\nmade sure I was within earshot of him when I asked another person who was walking toward the\ndoor, “Hey, do you know whose Kia that is?” The woman I had spoken to turned and looked at me as\nif I was nuts, but it didn't matter. It was enough for the owner of the car to slow down and turn\naround as well.\nHe looked at me and said, “It's mine. Is there a problem?”\nI put my hand out and said, “Paul from HR.” I paused long enough to pray that he was not from HR\ntoo, and then I continued: “Sorry, I'm new. My wife and I were just looking at that exact car. I'm\ncurious what you think of it.”\nThat was all that was needed. He wanted to show me every feature and talk about it. After a brief\npreview of the car, I said, “Hey, I'm late for a meeting. Do you mind if we walk and talk?”\n“Not at all, Paul.” As we started walking, he told me about the warranty, the comfort, the gas\nmileage, and so much more. He loved his car.\nAs we approached the front desk, I said, “You obviously made the best choice possible. How did you\nget so knowledgeable about the cars?” With that statement, I not only complimented his choice but\nvalidated his knowledge. He badged in and held the door for me without even thinking.\nFor the sake of the security guards watching, I pulled my wallet out and tapped the RFID receptacle\non the door post and kept walking naturally. This guy talked to me about his Kia for 20 minutes as\n107\nhe led me to HR. When we got there, he said, “Well, here we are—your office. My extension is 4328.\nIf you need more info, just let me know.”\nI said, “Well, I feel like I should just let you buy me the car—you know so much. Can I call you\naround 3 p.m. after my meeting?”\n“Sure! No problem! Talk then.” And he disappeared around the corner.\nI liked something he liked, and I liked him for his knowledge. Those two things alone got me past\nsecurity, into the building, and free from all security checks.\nLiking is a powerful principle that can, literally and figuratively, open many doors for you as a\nprofessional social engineer. If you are like me, the hardest part is learning to be interested enough\nthat your “liking” comes off as genuine.\nPRO TIP\nYou don't want to be warm and friendly but then become cold and uncaring as\nsoon as you get what you want. Those kinds of incongruent actions can cause your\ntarget to have a negative feeling.\nPrinciple Eight: Social Proof\nIn 1969, Dr. Robert O'Connor performed a study called “Modification of Social Withdrawal Through\nSymbolic Modeling” (Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 1969,\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1311030) The subjects of this study were young\nchildren who had social anxieties and were withdrawn in school.\nThe children were divided into two groups. Group 1 was shown a video that contained no level of\nsocial interaction. Group 2 was shown a video that lasted about 23 minutes and involved children\nbeing very social with positive results.\nThe children in group 1 had no alteration to their behavior, while the children in group 2 had\nmarked improvement in their social interactions. Not only that, but even when the doctor returned\nsix weeks later to observe the children, those in group 2 were now leading the pack in social\ninteraction.\nThe doctor was able to modify a potentially life-long path to being socially withdrawn by using\nsomething called social proof. The video proved to the children in group 2 that it was good, safe, and\neven beneficial to be more social.\nSocial Proof in Action\nThere was a great TV program called Candid Camera on which they did a funny prank to show the\npowerful effects of social proof on different types of people. They would have three or four people\nwho were in on the prank act like they didn't know each other, enter an elevator, and turn toward\nthe rear. The one person who was not in on the prank would eventually turn to conform to the\ncrowd. In one case, they even got a young man to do a full circle and remove his hat, all using social\nproof.\nWe each want to be like everyone else. Some of you might argue that you're unique and don't really\nfit into any group, but that in itself is a group.\nWhen we are lost, confused, or unsure, we generally look to others to see how they are acting for\ncues (social proof) for what we should be doing.\nFUNNY STORY\nI showed that Candid Camera clip to a class I taught in Vegas. Five of my students\n108\ndecided to see if that would still work today. They pretended they didn't know\neach other and tried the test three times. In all three cases, the people who were\nnot in on the gag would conform to the group pressure and turn in the direction\nthe group was facing.\nFigure 6-10 illustrates the cycle of social proof.\nFigure 6-10 Social proof in action\nUsing Social Proof as a Social Engineer\nMany times, people do not want to be the first to take an action. However, I find that using social\nproof can ease people's minds at making the decision to take an action they are not comfortable\nwith.\nIn one case, I needed to gain access to a secure area of a building, so I donned the best telephone\ntechnician outfit I could build on short notice. Instead of going directly into my target's office, I went\nto the building next door first. I went in and introduced myself as Paul, a local telephone technician\nfrom XYZ Telephone Company. I said I'd be servicing the area and left a fake business card.\nI did this at the businesses on both sides of my target. Then I went into the target office. I\napproached the front desk and said, “My name is Paul. We are experiencing a fluctuation with the\ntelephone lines, which is causing outages of both phone and Internet in the area. I need to check\neach company on the block to ensure there are no problems in the system settings.” The woman at\nthe desk started to interrupt me, but I pushed through and looked down at my clipboard as I said, “I\nwas chatting with Beth next door, but their lines tested fine. I also ran the test on your other\nneighbor over here, but Fred was happy it wasn't them. So, I figured since I am out here, I should\njust run the tests on your system and ensure the problem is not here.”\nNow, instead of looking at her, I decided to scribble some imaginary notes on my clipboard order\nform for the other two companies. With only slight hesitation, the woman said, “Oh, I bet you made\nFred's day. He's always complaining about the service.”\nWith that, I was past the front desk and being escorted to the server room.\nI have used social proof with surveys, phishing emails, vishing calls, and more. In one vishing\ncampaign, I started each conversation with a brief introduction followed by, “I have only three more\ncalls left for the day, and then I am done. Thankfully most people have been super pleasant today.”\nThen I would lead right into my questions. More often than not, applying that slight social pressure\nworked—partially because people felt good about not being the first to give me all their information.\nSocial proof has been one of the most powerful aspects of influence that I have used.\n109\nInfluence vs. Manipulation\nAs I discuss the principles of influence, usually one of the questions that comes up is, “Some of the\nthings you did sound pretty manipulative, so aren't influence and manipulation the same thing?”\nThe fact is that influence and manipulation are similar and sometimes are confused for one another.\nLet me be very clear: What I'm sharing here is my viewpoint on this topic. I am by no means saying\nit is the only viewpoint. As a matter of fact, when we had Dr. Cialdini on the podcast, I learned that\nhis opinion on this topic differs from mine drastically.\nI define influence as “getting someone to want to do something you want them to do.” I define\nmanipulation as “getting someone to do something you want them to do.” The difference is that\nmanipulation generally does not include caring about the feelings of the target. Whereas influence\ntends to be positive in its themes, manipulation does not stay within that boundary.\nManipulation in Action\nThe best way to illustrate this concept of influence versus manipulation is to tell you a story that is\ntruly embarrassing for me, but it was also pivotal in that it changed my business.\nWhen I started focusing on being a professional social engineer, I was stuck on this thought that I\nhad to always win. The idea that anything less than a 100% win was failure was something I held\ndear. This thought motivated me to not really care much about the feelings of the client or their staff\nas long as I “won.”\nIn one job, I was not winning. I was losing. The targets weren't clicking on any phishing emails. They\nwere routinely shutting me down on vishing calls. My USB key drops were turned in and never\ninserted no matter what I labeled them. And two attempts at tailgating and using the heavy box ruse\nfailed me.\nI was frustrated, and I didn't realize this was a great time to tell the client how awesome they were.\nInstead, I was driven to take this to the dark side. The company had an open lunch area that was\noutside. I had attempted to get inside through those doors but couldn't get past the security there,\nbut I had free access to the lunch area.\nThe pretext went like this: I was Frank T., the head of a new HR project to gather information for a\nhealthcare rollout. My secretary, Marsha, was a single mom and frazzled. I was standing within\nearshot of a table full of employees when Marsha walked up with her head down and handed me a\nstack of blank papers. I look at them and in a very angry tone, I said, “What is this crap, you\nworthless …” I let out a huge sigh and said, “Look, if one simple task is too much for you to handle,\nmaybe it's time for you to find a new job to support yourself and your kid! I'm DONE WITH YOU!”\nI then slammed the papers on the table and walked away from Marsha, leaving the papers behind.\nMarsha sat down and started to cry.\nI saw one guy making a beeline for me, but when he saw Marsha crying, he turned to her and said,\n“Are you okay? What was that about?”\nShe looked up him, scared and nervous, and replied, “Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to bother you\nduring lunch. You know how Frank is. He is stressed.”\n“Frank who? No one has the right to talk to you like that. This is ridiculous.” He sat down next to\nher.\n“No, you don't understand. He's having problems at home, and he has a deadline to get these forms\nfilled out by the end of day, and I dropped the ball and forgot. I thought I would do it during lunch,\nbut he just freaked on me. I'm going to get fired.”\n“He shouldn't talk to you this way … this is …”\nShe interrupted, now defending her abuser, “No, it's okay. I deserve it. I was supposed to get this\ndone last week. It's my fault. He is really a nice guy, and he took a risk on me.”\n“Fair or not, give me those papers!” The man, her savior, stood up and walked to every table and\nsaid, “We have until the end of day to complete this, but I want this done before you start eating\nlunch. When it is completed, hand it to this nice woman here.”\nHe pointed to Marsha, who was now smiling and thanking him for saving her job and being so kind.\n110\nBy the time the manager had ordered all those people in the lunch room to comply, we had dozens\nof forms with full names, dates of birth, network IDs, Social Security numbers, home addresses,\nemail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal identity information.\nSure, I won—but at what cost? When the people found out it had been a ruse, do you think there was\na teaching moment? What would the lesson have been? To not act like a decent human being? Don't\nhave empathy? That is not a good lesson to be teaching.\nBecause I had used manipulation, I was forever known at that company as the “guy who abused his\nsecretary.” I can tell you, not only was there no learning lesson but to this day, I have not received\nany more work from that company.\nPrinciples of Manipulation\nAlthough they are negative, manipulation does have the following principles:\nIncreased susceptibility\nEnvironmental control\nForced reevaluation\nRemoval of power\nPunishment\nIntimidation\nThe names alone should tell you why they are so negative, but there is one study that I think\nencapsulates why I do not like to use these principles.\nIn 1967, Dr. Martin Seligman and Dr. Steven F. Maier from the University of Pennsylvania\nperformed a study to determine how some of these principles worked. They used dogs as test\nsubjects to see how they would accept uncontrollable circumstances. Dr. Seligman and Dr. Maier\nwrote about the results in an article called “Learned Helplessness” (Journal of Experimental\nPsychology, May 1967, http://homepages.gac.edu/~jwotton2/PSY225/seligman.pdf).\nIn essence, they harnessed dogs in differing stages—either alone in a yoke or in a group—and then\nshocked the dogs with electricity. In some cases, the dogs had to figure out that there was a panel\nthat, when pressed, could stop the pain. But in other cases, the lever did nothing to stop the pain of\nthe shocks, and those dogs learned there was nothing they could do to stop the punishment—so they\naccepted it as part of life and lay there whimpering in pain without attempting to escape.\nAs disturbing as this study is to read about, it holds an important aspect to understanding the\nprinciples of manipulation. Many times, the subject will accept something they fear, that hurts, or\nthat they know is bad simply because they don't see any other option. Fear and anger override the\nbrain's ability to think rationally, which leaves only emotion for making decisions. As a professional\nsocial engineer, removing the option to think with logic, in most cases also removes the ability for\nthere to be a teaching moment. After the target finds out their fears were used as a test, it leads to\nmany negative emotions that leave the person not wanting to learn from you.\nChoosing Influence or Manipulation as a Social Engineer\nIf you want to be a professional social engineer, you will want to ensure your client has the chance to\nlearn from your endeavors in most cases. That means using influence rather than manipulation.\nHowever, before you decide that there is never a time where manipulation is usable, let me tell you\nabout a few cases where I use it and have no problem doing so.\nIn the Innocent Lives Foundation, we sometimes find the need to use manipulation to accomplish\nour goals. When we are hunting child predators or those who commit horrible crimes, whatever\nworks is what we use.\nI also use manipulation when working on nation-state attacks. Many times, when my SE team is\nprotecting nation-state assets or infrastructure, we employ both influence and manipulation to\nensure all aspects are tested.\nAnother situation in which I use manipulation is when a client requests it. Generally, this is when\nthe stakes are very high, such as when the client is a large financial institution, nation-state, or\ninfrastructure support organization that needs to test to the deepest levels possible. Sometimes a\n111\nclient says they need my team to use manipulation instead of influence to truly test the protocols.\nTypically, this request is made after numerous tests have been done, and we need to take it to the\nnext level. When we do these additional tests, we still make sure there is a learning lesson.\nFor example, one of our clients needed us to test their very resilient and advanced phone-support\nrepresentatives. The company protected data that was valued at millions of dollars, and the client\nwanted to make sure the phone-support reps would withstand the attacks they would get from real-\nworld attackers.\nAfter testing them a few times using influence, we decided to step it up to a pretext that involved two\nfemale agents on my SE team.\nAgent 1 called the department and requested some information to complete payroll using a very\nbelievable pretext, it went like this:\nSE agent 1: Hello, this is Sarah, from XYZ Company. My payroll person just got fired, and I must\ndo payroll today. I'm about to give birth to my first baby next week, and I need to get\nthis done before I leave for the weekend.\nPhone rep: Congratulations! How exciting! No worries—I can help you. I will just need to verify\nyou, and then I can reset the account to let you in.\nSE agent 1: Excellent, thank you. Ouch!\nPhone rep: Are you okay, Sarah?\nSE agent 1: I don't know. I just had this weird pain. It's probably just stress. Okay, let's do this so\nI can head out. What do you need?\nPhone rep: Okay, I need your account number and your identification PIN.\nSE agent 1: Sir, like I said, I just had to fire my payroll person, so I don't have that PIN. She reset\nit, and I need to get back into this account.\nPhone rep: Oh, Sarah, I am so sorry, but I …”\nSE agent 1: [going into labor and dropping the phone]: Oh my God, oh my God, my water broke!\nPhone rep: Are you okay? Ma'am? Are you okay?\nSE agent 1: [yelling as if to a coworker]: You! Come over here and get this phone, and [as if to\nanother coworker] YOU CALL 911!\nSE agent 2: Hello, who is this?\nPhone rep: Oh my God. Hi, this is Steve with QRS. I was just assisting Sarah with the payroll\naccount, but I think she needs help. You should go.\nSE agent 1: [yelling in the background]: If you hang up that phone, I will fire you. Get the payroll\ninformation or NO ONE is getting paid next week!\nSE agent 2: [in a very stressed tone]: Oh, Steve, I just need to get into the account, so Sarah will\nlet me take her to the hospital.\nAmazingly enough, Steve just gave over the account number and all the information we needed.\nInventive? Yes. Manipulation? Definitely! But the company had requested that we determine\nwhether its reps could stand up to the kind of real-world attack that was likely to come from a\nmalicious hacker, and we had a chance to prove what would and would not work on those agents.\nI haven't provided an exhaustive list of when you might be asked to use manipulation, but I've\ndiscussed some things that you need to consider if you are going to be or are presently a professional\nsocial engineer. Will you use manipulation? If so, when will you use it? How much will you use?\nAll the same principles of influence and manipulation work on most non-psychopathic human\nbeings, and none of us can spend too much time on the dark side without turning dark ourselves. It\nis impossible to step in some mud and not get a little dirty. I find it useful to talk to my team at the\nInnocent Lives Foundation after we have used manipulation as a tactic, to ensure they feel okay and\nare not too damaged. The foundation has a psychologist on staff to ensure that our people have a\nsafe and healthy environment in which they can unload the mental weight from any negativity.\nSummary\n112\nIf you take away only one important thing from this chapter, let it be this: You are human (just as I\nam human). Influence works—plain and simple. It works on your targets, and it works on you. It is\nimpossible to stop it, no matter how hard you try.\nInfluence, when used properly, is rewarding and can alter the way someone behaves and interacts\nwith you. When you master the ability to blend influence with rapport-building skills, you truly\nbecome unstoppable.\nPeople will want to tell you everything about themselves. They will want to trust you. They will\nwant to be your friend and help you out. This is powerful, and if you're not careful, it can go to your\nhead, and you can abuse this power.\nKeep yourself in check by constantly reminding yourself of why you chose this career path. I\nconstantly tell myself the following things:\nI am doing this to ensure my clients maintain their security.\nI am doing this because I am good at it.\nI am doing this to help people learn about this dangerous vector.\nI am doing this to provide for my family and those I employ.\nThese responsibilities play a huge part in being a professional social engineer. And thinking this way\ninfluences my decisions to benefit my clients, my employees, and myself.\nThe principles of influence and manipulation I discussed in this chapter are used every day by\nmarketers, advertisers, salespeople, organizations looking for donations or recruits, and everyone in\nbetween. Why should we not use these same principles to help our clients understand how\ndangerous they can be in the hands of a skilled conman or social engineer?\nTake time to read this chapter over a few times and pick one principle at a time to work on. Try\nusing that principle at the office or with your family in a benign way. As you master its use, it will\nbecome part of your communication arsenal—another arrow in the quiver to make you an even\nbetter social engineer.\nI have two more arrows to give you for your quiver. The next chapter will take the skills I've talked\nabout in the last two chapters over the top: Framing and Elicitation.\n113",
    "question": "What is the key difference between influence and manipulation in the context of social engineering?",
    "summary": "The chapter explores the principles of influence in social engineering, focusing on eight key ideas: reciprocity, obligation, concession, scarcity, authority, consistency, liking, and social proof. These principles are explained through real-life examples and tied to social engineering techniques. It also distinguishes influence from manipulation, emphasizing that influence is about getting someone to want to do something, while manipulation is about getting them to do it regardless of their feelings. The chapter concludes by highlighting the importance of using influence to help clients and the ethical responsibility of a social engineer."

    "text": "7\nBuilding Your Artwork\nArt and science have their meeting point in method.\n—EARL EDWARD GEORGE BULWER-LYTTON\nI decided to revert, momentarily, back to the art theme of my first book, Social Engineering: The\nArt of Human Hacking (Wiley, 2011), to clearly define why this chapter is so important. After you\nmodel your communications plan, build your pretext, master rapport and influence techniques, and\nare ready to go, you need to be able to put it all into action. That is where art meets the science of\nframing and elicitation.\nAs Earl Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, the 18th-century British politician and novelist, says, the\nmethod is where art and science meet and even cross over each other. This chapter discusses how, as\na professional social engineer, you can artfully learn how to use elicitation and framing with\nscientifically accurate precision.\nWhen I first started working in a kitchen, the head chef (my boss), handed me a bag of celery and\nsaid, “Julienne this bag.” Being very new at that job, I had no clue what he meant. After only a few\nseconds, which seemed like an eternity to me, he said, “You have no clue what I am talking about, do\nyou?”\nI gave one nod, and within 60 seconds, the chef had the bag opened and a pile of celery that looked\njust like Figure 7-1.\nFigure 7-1 Perfectly julienned celery\n“Ah, thin-sliced into strips,” I said as if I was the smartest man alive. I started on my first stalk—nice\nand slow—while the chef observed. He said, “Good job; now I need two bags like that.”\nFeeling confident, I tried to imitate his speed. For the sake of those with a weaker stomach, I will not\npost the picture of celery and finger mixed together on the table.\nYou're probably wondering what connection this story has to the subject of this chapter. Cooking is\nan art, but there is a science behind the way you use the tools—the way you wield the knife can make\nor break your abilities as a chef. Understanding the art of how to make food tasty is very important\n114\nto a chef, and so is understanding how to prepare the food (usually minus finger parts) in a way that\nenhances the dish. Blending the art of food preparation and the science of putting it all together\ncreates a perfectly balanced dish.\nNOTE\nOver the years, I have cut my fingers so many times that they look like a creation\nfrom Dr. Frankenstein, but I have never in my career or hobby as a chef, served\nanyone any part of my fingers in a dish. Just thought you would like to know.\nThis chapter is designed to show you how to blend the art and science of framing and elicitation to\nbring the skills from the first six chapters to master level. If you apply what you learn in this chapter\nproperly, you should be able to achieve at least one social engineering Michelin star.\nThe Dynamic Rules of Framing\nThink of your house or apartment and how it is shaped. When you look at it from the outside, does\none room jut out farther than the others? Do you have an odd-shaped sun room, or is it just a\nsquare? How it looks—where the walls are, where the windows are placed, the location of the doors,\nand so on—is determined by how the house is framed out. In other words, what you see and perceive\nabout your house is based on how the framing was done.\nFraming in the sense of communications is not so different. I consider framing, or how someone\nviews and reacts to a certain situation, as largely based on what that person has experienced or\nunderstood throughout their life. And those frames, or viewpoints, can be altered by life experience.\nWhen I was 16 years old, surfing and skateboarding were the center of my life. In my opinion, there\nwas nothing else worth living for. An example of how framing is so dynamic comes from this time in\nmy life.\nOne day, a group of us loaded our surfboards onto the racks of two cars, piled in, and drove in the\nmiddle of the night from the west coast of Florida to the east coast. We had heard there was a storm\ncoming and wanted to catch some of the great waves.\nWe arrived at about 5:00 a.m. The sun was due to rise in an hour and a half. We unloaded all our\nboards and waxed up. We still had about 30 minutes before the sun would be up enough for us to\nclearly see, but we were anxious and 16 years old, so we decided to paddle out in the dark to catch\nthe first wave as soon as the sun had come up. We could hear waves crashing on shore, and we could\nalso make out the silhouette of some really large wave sets in the distance.\nOne by one, the six of us ran into the waves and paddled to the lineup. We sat in the water, bobbing\nup and down and waiting for the sun to come up. Every few minutes, we could hear what sounded\nlike a large shotgun blast.\nWe didn't think anything of it as the sound seemed pretty far off and didn't sound too ominous. I\nstarted to smell something pungent, so I looked at one of my friends and said, “Hey, is it red tide?”\nRed tide is a time of year when there is a really bad algal bloom that kills fish and everything else—\nand the smell is pretty bad. But my friend said, “No, that's not yet, not sure what that is …”\nIt was only a few minutes later, the sun was clearly over the horizon, and we were seeing beautiful\npeeling wave sets ready for riding. We also saw a group of fishermen on a pier pretty close to us—\nchumming the waters for shark! The shotgun blasts we'd heard were from the fishermen dispatching\nthe sharks as they reeled them in. So, my friends and I were sitting in pools of chum. We laughed\nabout it with an almost idiotic sense of humor about how dangerous it was.\nI looked down and saw a giant shadow under my board. I've never been a good gauge of size, so I\ncan't tell you exactly how long it was, but I can say it was bigger than my board.\nMy friends and I laughed more, and we paddled out of the chum and caught a few great waves. At\nthe age of 16, my frame of reference was all about the surf, and danger from sharks didn't mean\nmuch to me.\n115\nAs I think about that situation now, almost 30 years later, my frame of reference has certainly\nchanged. I'm filled with fear even though I'm nowhere near water, chum, or surf. When I was that\n16-year-old surfer, I had no cares in the world, and living dangerously was part of my life. Now, as\nthe father of two, a business owner, and a person who wants to live, the idea of being in chum-filled,\nshark-infested waters fills me with a proper sense of dread. And by dread, I mean I want to build a\ntime machine and go back in time to kick my own butt.\nMy life experiences, my age, and my internal makeup all form the frame. This point is too important\nto pass up. Framing is dynamic—not static.\nFraming is a feature of how our brains work. Our minds react to the context of something rather\nthan reacting just to the thing itself. Here are some examples:\nThe moon seems to be bigger when it's on the horizon than when it's directly overhead. The\nreason is because our brains react to the context (the location) of the object, even though the\nmoon is the same size in both places.\nWe don't say that we kill our dogs; we say that we put them to sleep. This is a frame we use to\nhelp us deal with a painful circumstance.\nIn 1974, Elizabeth Loftus demonstrated framing in a study she performed, by changing one word\nin a sentence. After showing people a video of a car accident, she asked one of two questions:\nHow fast were the cars going when they contacted?\nHow fast were the cars going when they crashed?\nThe first question always elicited a response of a slower speed than when she used the word\ncrashed in the second sentence. (You can read about this study at\nwww.simplypsychology.org/loftus-palmer.html.)\nIn a 1986 study done by David A. Snow, E. Burke Rochford Jr., Steven K. Worden, and Robert\nD. Benford titled “Frame Alignment Process, Micromobilization, and Movement Participation”\n(www.jstor.org/stable/2095581?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), the researchers defined\nthe following four different aspects of framing.\nFrame bridging\nFrame amplification\nFrame extension\nFrame transformation\nI want you to think about frame bridging as a social engineer. As you approach a company you see a\nsecurity guard. His frame is to keep anyone who doesn't belong out. The social engineer's frame is\ngain access to the building.\nIt doesn't work too well for the social engineer to go up to the security guard and say, “Hey, I need to\nget in there to steal some stuff and cause general havoc.” Even if you are a professional and a\npentester, it won't work to say, “Look, I'm a pro and trying to help test your company to fix the\nholes. Let me in so I can hack your servers.”\nSo, what builds that bridge between your frame and the guard's frame? Can you think of something I\ndiscussed earlier in this book that bridges that gap? A clue is in Figure 7-2.\n116\nFigure 7-2 The pretext bridges the framing gap.\nThe pretext bridges the gap and helps you alter the frame of the target to be more accepting of what\nyou say and do. All the detail you put into your pretext—what you carry with you, how you look, and\nso on—makes framing easier, but there's more to it.\nIn 2004, author George Lakoff wrote the book Don't Think of an Elephant! (Chelsea Green\nPublishing). In that book, he defined four rules of framing. These four rules are essential to\nunderstand whether you want to master this art. I have adapted Lakoff's four rules to apply to social\nengineering.\nRule 1: Everything You Say Evokes the Frame\nTo clearly grasp this rule, you need to understand how our minds work to visualize things as\npictures. Great teachers and storytellers use their words to help you picture the points in the stories.\nHere's an example of how two different stories can be written about the same event:\nStory 1 As I sat on my surfboard, I saw a large wave coming toward me. I lay down and paddled,\nbut the wave crashed, and I found myself under the water wondering just how big that shark\nreally was.\nStory 2 I looked out at the horizon; the sun was just barely peeking over. Its rays not only\nilluminated the water but warmed my face. I saw a wave that looked like a freight train bearing\ndown on me. Its power was easily noticeable from the speed and thickness of the wave. Its foamy\nhead hurled toward me like an angry lion.\nI lay down on my board and quickly whipped it around to face the shore. I dug into the water\nusing every fiber of my shoulder muscles. Although fluid, I felt the water with every stroke as if I\nwas digging through wet cement.\nThe wave caught my board as if a supernatural force had grabbed it. I went from standing still to\ndropping in on a roller coaster in a matter of seconds. I struggled to try to stand as my board\nwobbled and smacked the top of the water. When I turned, I saw nothing but the lip of the wave\nthat was about to smack me in the face like an angry taskmaster.\nAs the wave tossed over me, I was forced underwater, and all I could do was start to imagine\nthat living missile of a shark heading toward me. I struggled in panic and fear to make it above\nwater. When I did, I grabbed my board in white-knuckled fear and paddled to shore.\nBoth stories are about the same event, but which helps you really picture it in your mind? Which\nhelps you feel like you are there with me?\nThe answer is obvious: Story 2. That is why this rule is so important. Sometimes the words we\nchoose in our daily vocabulary can create mental pictures that are offensive to targets. As a\nprofessional social engineer, I find that not only do I succeed more, but I have a higher number of\n117\nreturn clients if I use non-offensive language than if I use language that might offend.\nTo keep this book PG-13, I won't go through an extensive list of words that can be offensive, but here\nare a few general guidelines about things you should avoid:\nRacial Slurs Even said in humor, racial slurs are not funny. Not only are they not funny, they're\nusually seen as signs of ignorance.\nGender- or Sexuality-based Slurs These slurs have the same effect as racial slurs—they are\nsigns of ignorance and are destructive to rapport-building.\nCurse Words I find that even if my targets use coarse language, I can avoid doing so myself for\nthe sake of those who are overhearing the conversation. Often times, by not using the same\nlanguage as the target, I can effectively change their use of that language as well.\nBodily Functions These words trigger strong feelings of disgust, and therefore should be\navoided.\nThink about words you use in your daily vocabulary, and then decide if they might cause a target to\nfeel one of the seven base emotions: anger, surprise, fear, disgust, contempt, sadness, or happiness.\nThen decide if that emotion is positive or negative. If it is potentially negative to a damaging degree,\nerr on the side of caution before using the word.\nTIP\nMy industry does something called “penetration testing.” The name alone opens\nitself up for a slew of non-humorous sexual innuendoes. However, more times\nthan I care to mention, I've heard someone who has completed a pentest say, “I\nraped that server.” Considering that in America alone, someone is a victim of\nsexual assault every 98 seconds, I do not find that statement funny. In fact, the\nnegative impact of hearing a security test described as rape for a person who has\nbeen sexually assaulted could bring back the trauma all over again. Do not use\nthat term to describe your work!\nRule 2: Words T hat Are Defined with the Frame Evoke the Frame\nThe other night, I walked onto my porch, and in the corner by the light, I saw a creature in a web. It\nwas wrapping an insect into a cocoon for a later meal.\nWhat did I describe to you? Probably what you see in Figure 7-3.\nFigure 7-3 In case you are still guessing, yes, it's a spider.\n118\nPHOTO COURTESY OF ARTYANGEL, https://pixabay.com/en/spider-fly-web-insect-2683918/\nThe point is that I didn't need to use the word spider to get you to think spider. I can merely\ndescribe a spider, and your brain automatically pictures it.\nAs a professional social engineer, my pretext automatically makes you think about the job I'm trying\nto tell you that I'm there for. But I can also elicit the right emotional frame by describing a situation,\nrather than using threats.\nIn one case, I sent a phish to a client that read something like this:\nOn Jan 4, your car was photographed running stop light marker XCV431. A ticket was issued\nand has not been paid. Failure to pay the fine can result in a negative impact.\nYou can file a claim or verify your payment on our secure portal at\nwww.pleaseclickthisnowsoicanhackyou.com.\n(Yes, the URL has been changed for safety.) Notice that I didn't need to threaten arrest. I didn't need\nto threaten massive fines. I just painted enough of a word-picture to trigger the emotions of curiosity\nand fear but then gave the recipient hope there was a way out. (And, yes, he clicked.)\nRule 3: Negating the Frame\nImagine this scene: My student was tasked with getting some personal information from a person—\njust the full name, date of birth, and some brief history. Even though the student was nervous about\nbeing observed by me, the conversation started off pretty good and, after a minute, sounded like\nthis:\nStudent: Wow, thank you for your help. I was wondering what to buy her for a gift, and that is a\ngreat idea. [The student applied a very nice validation statement to an idea for a gift\nfor his wife for her birthday.]\nTarget: Yeah, no problem. So, I gotta … [She was about to say go but was interrupted by the\nstudent.]\nStudent: [putting his hand out]: I'm Tom, Tom Smith. [He used a nice natural rhythm to help\nelicit the target's name.]\nTarget: Uh, yeah, nice to meet you, Tom. I'm Sarah.\nStudent: Sarah, great to meet you. What was your last name?\nTarget: Well, why do you want to know that?\nStudent: Oh, no reason. Just was curious. Anyhow, so what do you do for your birthday? Are you\nborn in July?\nTarget: Hey, Tom, it was nice meeting you, but I'm not sure I want to just give that info out.\nSorry.\nStudent: No problem, Sarah, it's not like I am gonna hack you or anything!\nAt that last statement, the target literally leaned away from my student, looked at her watch, said\nshe was late, and left.\nWhat did he do? It is what we call negating the frame, which is defined as mentioning the very thing\nyou do not want your target to think about, in essence causing them to think about that very thing.\nWhat is the one thing you don't want your target to think about when you're engaging with them as a\nprofessional social engineer? How about getting hacked?!\nIf you don't want them to think about it, then don't say things like\n“I'm not gonna use it to hack you!”\n“It's not like I'm trying to break in!”\n“I would never send you a phishing email.”\n“I'm not a crook!”\nAll of these are examples of negating the frame. Any time we mention the frame of the opposition,\nwe negate our frame. And remember Figure 7-2—their frame is to protect.\nLook for ways to augment or enhance your frame using your pretext, clothing, or other tools;\n119\ntherefore giving the target the ability to bypass any internal questions and doubts.\nRule 4: Causing the Target to T hink About the Frame Reinforces the Frame\nAny time we get someone to think about a frame, we reinforce that frame. No matter what that\nframe is, we reinforce it. For example, parents have the choice to reinforce positive frames or\nnegative frames into their children, as in these examples:\n“You are so stupid!”\n“You're not good at sports.”\n“Can't you do anything right?”\n“You are really pretty and smart!”\n“You can accomplish anything you put your mind to.”\n“I know this is hard, but I know you can do it!”\nAs a professional social engineer, you can reinforce frames by the words, clothing, and pretexts you\nchoose.\nIn one vishing job my company was doing, our pretext was that we were calling from IT and we had\nhad a badge system corruption the night before. Our goal was to obtain full name, date of birth,\nemployee ID, and other details from the employees we were assigned to call. It went something like\nthis:\nTarget: Bob speaking. How can I help you?\nSE: Bob, this is Paul down in IT. Last night, we had a badging-system corruption error, and\nabout 100 accounts were flagged. You're a lucky winner. Did you have problems getting\ninto the building today?\nTarget: No, it worked. Who is this?\nSE: Paul, Paul Williams in IT. I work with Tony R. Look this will only take a minute. As you\nknow, our badge system is tied in with payroll, so we don't want to delay in fixing any\nerrors.\nTarget: Ha, that's true. Well, what do you need?\nSE: I need to verify your full name. Can you spell your last name for me?\nTarget: Um, seriously? It's S-M-I-T-H. Not too hard.\nSE: Wow, thank God I called. IT had Robert Jones in this record for this extension. That\nwould have messed up payroll for sure. I guess when the corruption algorithm was run, it\ntried to relink the tables and misaligned the database counters. [I said this knowing it\nmeant nothing, but I took a gamble that Bob from accounting was not really a geek.]\nTarget: Yeah, I don't want anyone else getting my paycheck. Let's check the rest.\nFrom there on out, it was a series of using deliberate false statements and positive reinforcement to\nget his full name, date of birth, employee ID, and even the last four digits of his Social Security\nnumber. My words and the pretext all reinforced my frame; therefore, the target more easily\naccepted it.\nKeep the target thinking about your frame throughout your opening words, and it will make moving\non to the next section so much easier. And we call that elicitation.\nElicitation\nHow would you define elicitation?\nI define it as “getting information you never ask for.” In essence, elicitation looks and sounds like a\nconversation. In that conversation, a skilled elicitor is steering the conversation in a certain\ndirection to obtain information without you having asked for it.\nElicitation has some natural rules and principles that are inherent to its success. Each of these is a\npowerhouse unto itself, but when you combine them, you will master the art of conversation, and as\na professional social engineer, that can make you a force to be reckoned with.\n120\nAs I go through the four rules of elicitation. keep in mind this one important point: If done right,\nelicitation should look and feel like a normal, non-forced conversation with your target.\nEgo Appeals\nIn Chapter 5, “I Know How to Make You Like Me,” I talk about ego suspension, and this principle is\nthe very opposite of that. In this case, you're focused on the target's ego rather than thinking about\nyour own.\nWhat is the ego? The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as, “A person's sense of self-esteem or\nself-importance.” This is important to understand because when we hear this, we may automatically\nassume we have to inflate the target's ego, but that is not what I am saying. I'm saying you have to\nappeal to their ego.\nAppealing to the target's ego needs to be done with the following three things in mind:\nYou have to use sincerity.\nYou have to have the proper level of rapport.\nYou have to be realistic.\n“Suppose I’ve never met you before just meet you, and I walk up to you and say, Wow, you are one of\nthe most attractive people I have ever seen.” If I then try to start a conversation with you, what\nmight you be thinking? Probably one or more of the following:\n“Creep!”\n“What do you want?”\n“Um, what's the scam?”\n“Of course, I am. Now go away!”\nWhatever you think at that moment, that appeal to your ego was not done with sincerity,\nrealistically, and at the level of rapport we have built, so it will not result in a good elicitation.\nHere's a story from the real life of my wife, who's one of the best elicitors I have ever seen. We were\nin New York City. I had taken her and the family to see my old stomping grounds. At one point, we\nwere on the subway going uptown. If you've ever been in the subway, you know that people just stay\nto themselves. People aren't rude, but they also aren't friendly. Everyone has somewhere to go and is\nstressed or tired. You stick to yourself and go about your business.\nMy wife was sitting across from this older African-American woman who looked like she was going\nto catch some sleep before her stop. My wife leaned over into her space, grabbed her scarf to feel the\nmaterial, and said, “Wow, this is truly beautiful and so soft. Can I ask you where you purchased\nthis?”\nNow we were on the subway in NYC, and my wife leaned across personal, ethnic, and space\nboundaries—and yet, those two became best friends in seconds. Why? What was the ego appeal?\nNot only did my wife validate the woman's choice of clothing, but she asked this woman to educate\nher on where to get it. And this was no scam—my wife was sincerely interested, and that sincerity\nwas easy to see.\nThanks to all of that, a 20-minute conversation ensued about where to get great clothing in NYC. As\nannoyed as I was because I realized I was now going to be spending more money, I could not help\nbut marvel at my wife and watch and learn as she taught me how to be a master elicitor.\nNow, how can you become a master like Areesa? What is the secret sauce? Here are a few hints:\nShe really does love people and is interested in them.\nHer intentions are altruistic.\nShe is adorable and has a great smile.\nBut what do you do if you're not a people-loving, friendly, adorable, smiley, tiny Asian woman like\nmy wife?\nFirst, practice observing some things about people—let's say your family. When you come home\nfrom work tomorrow, take notice of things: Did your daughter do the dishes? Did your son take out\nthe trash? Is their homework done? Did your wife have a long stressful day, too?\n121\nTry simply saying something like, “Wow, I noticed the dishes were done when I came home. Thank\nyou.” Or “Hey, honey, you look super tired. Was your day okay?”\nThen watch what happens. A person's body language will soften. They will open up and become\nfriendly and more talkative. Why? You validated them and appealed to their ego.\nAfter you've practiced on your family, take it outside the home and try it with strangers. This will be\nmuch more difficult. You have to observe without being creepy, and make your approach with all the\nlessons of Chapter 5. Then you start appealing to their ego.\nImagine this scenario: You're behind your target in the line at Starbucks. He is a 34-year-old tall\nmale. He is neatly dressed and has a preppy but nerdy style. You see him pull out a brand-new\niPhone and type a text on it. With just this information, what could be your ego appeal that would\nstart a conversation? Think about it for a second before you read on.\nI would try something like this: “Excuse me. I saw you have one of those iPhones. I was thinking of\nswitching over. Do you like it so far?”\nIf he just spent $1000 on a phone, then he is going to have an opinion. No matter what opinion he\ngives you, you can validate and appeal with, “Wow, you really helped me out here. I am never good\nwith these decisions, but you made it much easier. My name is Chris, Chris Hadnagy …” as I put my\nhand out to shake his.\nAnd now a conversation is started.\nMutual Interest\nThere are a lot of really hot topics in the world today. Many of them seem to not just separate people\nbut cause rifts the size of a small state. Some of these polarizing topics can create such passion that\nsome people even get violent if there are disagreements.\nIt is important for a professional social engineer to not only understand this but to have the ability\nto put aside their own thoughts on these hot topics and find mutual interest.\nLet me give you an example from my experience. I won't tell you which side of the fence I am on.\nImagine the situation as if you were there.\nI walked into an office-building lobby that I had been tasked to try to gain entry to, and I found a\nbunch of people standing around a TV. There had been a horrible incident—a school shooting.\nChildren were dead and wounded. The shooter killed himself. It was truly a horrible situation.\nOne man said, “If I was there, I would have had my gun, and he would be dead before he even got off\nhis first round.”\nAnother person replied, “This is the problem! It's because guns are so easy to buy that these things\nkeep happening!”\nYou could tell the room was getting divided and there were clearly two camps. The atmosphere in\nthe room was tense as people spouted their opinions on where they stood on this matter. One person\nlooked up to see me there and didn't even ask who I was. She just said, “Did you hear the news?\nLook, this is just awful.”\nI replied, “No, I didn't hear 'til I walked in. It sounds truly terrible. Do you have any family or friends\nin that area?”\n“Thank God, no,” she replied. Then without even a breath, she said, “But, it's okay. Bill has the\nsolution—he will just give out handguns to everyone in the country, and we can return to the Wild\nWest.”\nBill, who I could see was getting physically upset, said, “Or we can just take your idea and sit around\nsinging and praying while everyone kills our kids.”\nOuch. This was going downhill fast. I realized that it really wasn't the time to be a professional social\nengineer, but I could try to defuse the situation. Since both of their comments were pointed toward\nme, when Bill got done speaking, they both glared at each other and then at me, almost as if to say,\n“So, which side are you taking?”\nKnowing that if I took any side I would be alienating half the room, I said, “Oh, my. Those poor\nfamilies. I have two kids of my own. I can't imagine having to deal with the news of one of them\nbeing killed. This is truly a sad day.”\n122\nSuddenly the rift closed. There was no more gap. They all looked at each other and remembered it\nwasn't about being pro- or anti-gun. It was about our children. It doesn't matter if you are for guns\nor you hate them—children getting shot in school is a topic we can all agree is terrible.\nWhen your task is to social engineer someone or a group, and the topic may be challenging or the\npeople may not be your favorite, look for the common ground. There usually is one thing that you\ncan find that will allow you all to be on common ground and start a conversation.\nThe preceding example is a serious one, but this works even in minor cases, too. Here are some\ntopics that generally can help you start a conversation that establishes common ground:\nWeather Especially if there is some odd weather—a heavy snow storm, too much rain,\nunseasonably hot or cold spells—the weather can provide quick opening topics to break the ice.\nTechnology Asking for advice on tech the target has (cell phone, laptop, smart watch, etc.) that\nyou have observed can be a great way to get them talking.\nChildren As long as you ask questions at the appropriate level of rapport—and you are asking\ngeneral questions about kids, not about their kids specifically—this can really get people talking.\nPets People love to talk about (and share photos of) their pets.\nSports Although not everyone is interested in sports, if you notice someone wearing a particular\nteam's jersey or hat, it can be a great topic. As long as you don't say something like “Ah, Cowboy's\nfan, huh? Sorry.”—which is not a very good opener.\nI suggest you avoid topics like politics, health care, religion, other very deeply personal choices, or\nany violent news story. These topics can create a giant rift between you and your target.\nThrough observation of the target and their surroundings (whether through OSINT or physical\nobservation), find the topic that can be of mutual interest, then use that topic to start a conversation.\nDeliberate False Statement\nThe principle of deliberate false statement is so powerful that you have to try it. What happens to\nyou when you are in a grocery store and you hear someone in the line say something you know is\nfalse?\nI have heard and seen everything including someone making noises under their breath (like\n“hrmph” or “yeah, right”) to someone correcting a complete stranger.\nWhy do people react this way? We have the need to be right and to correct things that are wrong.\nWhen we hear something we “know” is wrong, we generally correct it, even if it is just in our own\nhead first. Depending on who we are, where we are, and our passion for the topic, we might let the\nidea out of our head and into the open.\nHere is an example that even shocked me as to how well it worked. I was sitting in a restaurant with\nRobin Dreeke, and we had planned out this conversation to see how deliberate false statement\nwould work. It was a small restaurant with tables that were close to each other. It wasn't hard for\ndiners to hear others' conversations if they wanted.\nRobin said, in a pretty loud voice, “Hey, did you see that article in the Times that said over 80% of\nthe people use their date of birth as their ATM pin?”\nThis study did not actually exist, the article that Robin was referring to wasn't real, and for the love\nof all that is holy, I hope that statistic is really, really off.\nI chimed in, “No, that's not true. I use a combination of my wife's and my date of birth, so its 0411.”\nRobin said, “Well, I think it's true, because I do.”\nThen we both just got silent for a couple seconds, and as if on cue, the couple next to us looked over,\nand the husband said, “I tell her all the time to not use her date of birth for that PIN, but she tells me\nit's easy to remember.” Amazingly enough, his wife said, “Well, how can you not remember 0660,\nright?”\nWhoa, did this woman just give us—complete strangers in a restaurant—her PIN number? I wish I\ncould say it stopped there. But it did not! The man to the other side of us turned to the woman he\nwas with and said, “So, what kind of a PIN do you use?”\nAnd without hesitation, she replied, “My bank lets me use six digits, so I actually use my daughter's\n123\nwhole date of birth: 031192.”\nThe waitress who was overseeing all this said, “My bank lets me choose an actual word, which I type\nout using the keypad. My son named his first pet Samson, so I just use that.”\nHere I was, sitting in a public restaurant, collecting everyone's dates of birth, pets' names, and,\nscarily enough, bank card PINs because of one deliberate false statement.\nI was so enamored by this principle that I started using it everywhere and teaching it. Then I had a\nstudent who became my teacher. I told this story in class, and he said, “Whoa, I have an idea of some\nthings I want to try.”\nLater in the class, I was observing him out in public interacting with some targets. He walked up to a\nwoman who was sitting at a table eating a bowl of strawberries. With no introduction, no rapport, he\nhad this conversation:\nStudent: Hey, you like strawberries. You must be born in February!\nTarget: Umm, no, actually I was born in July.\nStudent: Oh, like on the fourth, with the holiday?\nTarget: No, the 11th. Why? [She gave him a confused look.]\nStudent: Okay, cool. Bye.\nAnd then he walked away. I said, “There's no way that would work again.” But he went up to one\ncomplete stranger after another and threw out the weirdest deliberate false statements. Every time,\npeople gave him information.\nThe flaw with this method was there was no rapport. So, when he was done, his targets were left\nconfused and wondering what had just happened. They definitely were not left “feeling better for\nhaving met him.”\nBe careful with deliberate false statement, and use these guidelines:\nUsing deliberate false statement too many times in a row can make you come across as\nunknowledgeable, and that can make your target lose faith in you.\nDon't confuse deliberate false statement with negating the frame. If you don't want the target to\nthink about hacking, don't mention “hacking” in your deliberate false statement.\nDeliberate false statement works much better after you have built some level of rapport with the\ntarget.\nThe deliberate false statement must have a ring of truth to it. If my student had approached the\nfirst woman and said, “Oh, you like strawberries—you must fly dragons,” he would have had\nnowhere to go with that; confusion would have been the result, not the need to correct.\nI truly do challenge you to try deliberate false statement. You'll be amazed at how well it works, and\nhow much information you will receive.\nWalking up to a complete stranger and asking for his or her PIN, date of birth, or other personal\ninformation will result (most of the time) in all sorts of alarms being raised. But by employing a\ndeliberate false statement, you can work all those personal details right into a conversation.\nFALSE STATEMENTS PLUS QUID PRO QUO\nI tried my student's method in one elicitation engagement, and it worked like\nmagic. Then I followed up with, “Ah, August 12th. That's funny, my sister was\nborn in August, too.”\nGiving some quid pro quo helps the target feel at ease with what they just gave up\nin the elicitation. I added, “My grandma used to say that August babies were more\nartistic and creative. Do you have any musical talent?”\nWith a chuckle the woman said, “No, I am more of a math geek. That's why I'm an\naccountant. I guess grandmas aren't always right, are they?”\nI said, “Ha, I guess not. But don't tell her. My Italian grandma will grab your ear\n124\nand yell at you!”\nThe woman replied, “Oh, I know how that is. My family came over from Ireland.\nThey didn't pinch as much as punch!”\n“Ouch! Sounds like … um … fun. So, do you have a really Irish-sounding last\nname?” I thought this might be a great segue to getting more personal info.\n“You can't get more Irish than my name: Mary O'Donnell,” she said, putting an\nIrish lilt on it.\nI replied, “Oh, you have a very cool little accent. Sadly, I've lost all my Italian\nexcept for the curse words.”\n“Well, that may come in handy still.”\nNotice that with one deliberate false statement and some quid pro quo, I was able\nto obtain this woman's full name, date of birth, job function, and other details\nabout her life and family.\nHaving Knowledge\nDon't confuse having knowledge with being a know-it-all. The two things are completely different.\nHaving knowledge on the topic you will cover with your target can go a long way during elicitation.\nTime for another fail story, and this one led to a failure on the job.\nMy company was tasked to gain entry to the server room of a university. In scoping out the building\nthat the server room was in, we noticed one professor would go into the building at about 7:00 a.m.\nNo other staff was in the building at that time, so we thought it would be a great time to gain entry.\nThe doors all used RFID locks, and because this was an SE job, we thought we would try the human\nangle first.\nWe did OSINT on the professor and saw he wrote a paper on something to do with quantum physics\nand some other large words that I don't understand. With my infinite wisdom and skill (heavy dose\nof sarcasm here), I memorized the name of the paper, and the next morning, I planned to approach\nthe professor.\nAs he briskly walked toward the building, my plan was to start a conversation about the paper, and\nwe would walk into the building together, and when we parted ways, I would break into the server\nroom area.\nI started off, “Good morning, sir. My name is Paul Williams. You're professor Smith, right?”\n“Yes, I am. How can I help you?” the professor asked, without stopping his walk toward the building.\n“I wanted to ask you some questions about the paper you wrote on quantum physics,” I said as I\nrattled off the title of the paper with effortless ease.\nThere was a slight pause, and he said, “Okay. What questions do you have?”\nOh no! My brain raced. How did I not think past this part? We still walked toward the door, but it\nseemed to be miles away now. I truly tried to think of one intelligent thing to say, and my best\nresponse was, “Um, so, what made you write that paper?” My voice trailed off at the end in\nuncertainty.\nFor the first time since I approached him, the professor stopped, turned toward me fully, and said,\n“I'm not sure what kind of game you are playing, Son, but come back when you've actually read it.”\nHe then turned and walked even more briskly toward the door.\nSure, I could have read the paper, but even if I had read that paper a few dozen times, I doubt I\ncould have come up with even one or two intelligent questions on that topic. Or I could have found\nsomeone who understood the topic to help me formulate questions that were intelligent. However,\nneither of those solutions would have kept things simple. The simplest path would have been for me\nto have used a pretext that fits the knowledge I have. Maybe I could have been a student who was\nlooking to take this professor's class, and I wanted to know what papers or books I should read to\nmake his class more enjoyable.\nWhen I approached him, I should have had knowledge of the university, what courses and teachers I\nwould be interacting with, and what programs exist. Having this knowledge doesn't mean I would\n125\nhave had to use it and blurt it all out from the get-go just to prove my point, but having that\nknowledge would have made the way I talk and the things I said more believable. That way, if a\nquestion like “What courses are you in now?” had come up, I would have had that knowledge handy\nso I could remain believable.\nThe more believable you are, the easier it is for the target to assume you are who you say you are.\nThe Use of Questions\nQuestions are a natural part of conversation. From the moment we begin to speak, we use questions\nto send and receive data. This is why understanding the four different types of questions—as well as\nhow to use them—is essential to becoming a good elicitor. That is what this next section will cover.\nQuestions are powerful parts of communication. As soon as we hear a question, our brains start to\nformulate a response. Even if that answer is never spoken, forming a response is unavoidable.\nSkillful use of questions gets the target invested in the conversation. Each type of question can be\nused by a skilled social engineer to elicit both information and emotions from targets.\nTo help you understand how you can use different types of questions for social engineering, here's a\nstory from my own experience, which I refer to as OpOfficeSpace.\nMy task was to gain entry onto the 16th floor of an office building, but the company that occupied\nthat floor didn't own the whole building. I came up with the pretext that I was sent from corporate to\nconduct a surprise inspection to see if workspace safety policies, such as keeping exits unblocked,\nwere being followed.\nI based the pretext on some OSINT we had found about new policies and bad press that this\ncompany had received for having poor employee working conditions. Publicly, the company had\nvowed to fix those problems and claimed that they sent strong messages to all satellite offices with\ninstructions about what to do.\nI made a badge that had the corporate logo on it and “Safety Inspector” in bold letters across the top.\nArmed with my clipboard, camera, and some other tools, I entered the front doors and walked right\npast the security desk.\nThe woman behind the front desk popped to her feet and asked, “Excuse me sir, where are you\ngoing?”\nI barely slowed down while answering, “I am going to 16.”\n“Um, please stop. I need to get your ID since you don't have the right badge to use the elevator.”\n“Oh, I'm sorry. Let me explain. What is your name, ma'am?”\n“I'm Alicia Smith,” she said as she pointed to her badge.\n“Nice to meet you, Alicia. I work for ABC Corporation on 16, and due to recent incidents at some of\nour facilities, I've been tasked with the job of doing surprise inspections. The facilities have not been\nnotified. Have you heard about the recent problems we've had with employee work conditions?”\nShe shrugged her shoulders but replied, “Yes, I saw it on the news.”\n“Okay, then you know how much trouble we got into. I'm sure your employer takes good care of you,\nand these inspections are all about making sure our people are being taken care of, but they must\nremain a surprise to be effective.”\n“Okay, I understand that. I think it's great to see a company that takes that so seriously. I will badge\nyou to 16 in the elevator.” With that, I was walking toward the secure elevators with my new ally.\nI stopped and asked, “Alicia, some elevators require badges for both directions. What kind of a\nsecurity system do you have in the elevators?”\n“Oh, silly me. I almost forgot, yes. We just had this new type of elevator security system installed,\nand you need a badge to do both. Let me grab you a visitor one. Wait here.” She ran back to the desk\nto grab me an unsigned badge and then sent me on my way.\nI exited the elevator on the 16th floor, and to both my left and right were glass doors. I could see a\nsecretary sitting to my right, and she was looking at me with an increasingly curious look. As I\nwalked up to the desk, I knew she would ask me some questions, and I wanted to preempt her, so I\nsaid, “Hi there. I'm Paul from corporate.” I pulled out my badge and showed it to her briefly, but I\n126\nwasn't sure how accurate it was, so I pulled my pen out and pointed to the clipboard. “This is office\n43211, right?” I asked this as I pointed to a work order.\n“Um, yes. Paul, why are you here? You're not on the schedule,” she said, looking very confused.\n“I wouldn't be on the schedule—this is a surprise inspection. After last month's problems with\nOSHA, we need to make sure that our work space has been drastically improved. You got that\ninternal memo, right?”\nShe nodded her head yes and said, “Yes. I was asked to print it and make sure everyone had a\nphysical copy.”\n“Good. Well that marks my first check box off.” I turned to the second page and checked off a box\nbefore I said, “Thank you! You made my job start off great! I want to write your name next to it as\none of the employees who followed directions. What is your name?”\n“Beth. Beth Simons.”\n“Excellent, Beth. As observant as you are, I am sure you saw some areas that need special\nconsideration here. Where should I start?”\nShe looked toward one area and said, “I think we are all compliant here, but I'm not sure. I don't\nwant to get anyone in trouble.”\n“I get that, Beth. Thank you for being so honest. I'm going to start my walkthrough. I'll let you know\npersonally when I'm done.” With that, I was in the office space unsupervised.\nOpen-Ended Questions\nJust as it sounds, an open-ended question is one that doesn't direct the receiver in any particular\ndirection but instead allows them to answer solely from their opinion. Open-ended questions\ngenerally can't be answered with a simple yes or no. An open-ended question allows the target to\ndecide how much information they will provide. This is empowering and validating for the person\ninvolved, and it can help build rapport. An open-ended question is something like, “What is your\nfavorite restaurant in town?”; as opposed to, “Is there a good restaurant close to this hotel?” Both\nare valid questions, but one elicits information that will enable you to profile the target more\nthoroughly. The words you use within a question elicit emotions, and those emotions affect the\nanswer you get. An open-ended question encourages the target to engage their knowledge, attitudes,\nbeliefs, opinions, and feelings.\nThe success of these questions is largely dependent on the way you, as a professional social engineer,\nemploy active listening and direct the questions to obtain useful information. This is important to\nunderstand, so when you are formulating your pretext, you can start to plan what type of questions\nyou would naturally use. Remember, the goal is to keep the target talking openly about relevant\ndetails that can assist in the end goal of completing the social engineering engagement.\nPRO TIP\nThe motto “just keep them talking” is not really relevant to social engineering. We\ndon't want our targets to just talk—we want them to talk about information that's\nrelevant to our needs.\nIn OpOfficeSpace, I was able to use open-ended questions multiple times, but one you may recall is\nwhen I asked Alicia the security guard about the elevators. She not only answered the question but\nwent on to tell me about the new security system installed in the elevators. Using an open-ended\nquestion in this situation allowed me to gather not just a badge but critical intel on their security\nsystems.\nClosed-Ended Questions\nClosed-ended questions elicit brief and narrow answers. Usually, they can be answered with one or\ntwo words. Skilled interrogators often use closed-ended questions to verify facts they've already\nobtained. In addition, closed-ended questions are excellent to use for reading nonverbals. When a\nclosed-ended question is asked, our bodies answer before our mouths do. Most of the time, our body\n127\nlanguage gives an honest answer even if we state a lie. We might shrug or shake our head no but say\nthe word “Yes.”\nI have used closed-ended questions many times with my kids. For example, I might say this to one of\nthem: “I told you that 11:00 p.m. was bedtime. Did you actually shut down the computer and go to\nbed at 11?” The head shakes no but the child says, “I think so. I didn't see the exact time.”\nA benefit to closed-ended questions is that they ensure the social engineer is able to elicit details and\nsecure specific bits of information. When you're using closed-ended questions, it's a good idea to\nstart off with basic questions before getting to anything too deep. The basics of who, what, where,\nwhy, and how are good places to begin.\nIn OpOfficeSpace, I used closed-ended questions with Beth the receptionist when I asked her if she\nhad gotten the memo. She not only nodded her head yes but she also verbally answered “Yes.”\nHowever, when I used the same type of question with Alicia about seeing any news regarding to the\nproblems in ABC Corporation, she shrugged and replied, “Yes.” This incongruence tells me she\nwasn't really sure if she knew about this. Because of my perception of her confusion, I could add\nsome facts that might not have been completely truthful.\nLeading Questions\nI was sent a link to a web page that contained a video. The page started off with something like this:\n“In this study, only really observant and smart people can count the number of times the white\nshirts pass the ball.”\nI sat there thinking, “I'm a social engineer—one of the most observant humans on the planet. I got\nthis!” I clicked Play.\nI never blinked, and I counted every pass. I stared at the screen the whole time. When the video was\ndone, I was presented with some options for the pass count. When the correct number came up, I\nexclaimed to the screen, “That's it!” with serious pride in my voice.\nThen the video went on to say, “But how many of you saw the man in a gorilla costume and a tutu\ndance across the court and exit the other side?”\nIn utter disbelief, I exclaimed, “There was no gorilla!” After all, I'm a social engineer and one of the\nmost observant humans on the planet, right? There's no way I could miss something that obvious.\nI replayed the video from the beginning, and, to my amazement, a six-foot man in a gorilla costume\nand tutu came on the court, did a twirl, and exited the other side.\nHow had I not seen that?\nThe answer is simple: leading. I was led to focus on one thing—the pass count of people in white\nshirts—and my brain blocked out everything else.\nSo, how can a social engineer use leading in question form? In the OpOfficeSpace scenario, I was\nable to lead the target to thinking about possible repercussions of not complying with my request to\nget into the CEO's office. I did this by combining a statement with a leading question: “I understand\nthat I'm not on the schedule, Beth, so how do you suggest we explain to Mr. Smith that I could not\nfix his computer after he comes back from his holiday?\nIn addition to leading questions, I often use misdirection when I am accessing a building. I have a\nclipboard with a camera embedded in the front. There is a large (quarter-size) hole with a lens\nprotruding and another smaller hole with a microphone. I constantly worry that a target will see it. I\nput a work order or other paper on the front of the clipboard, and with a nice metal pen, I tap on\nthat paper while saying something like, “Yeah, you see here? I'm supposed to check the serial\nnumber of the motor to see if there's a recall.” So far, no one has ever seen the camera, because I\nlead them to look away from it.\nAs a professional social engineer, you have to plan ahead to be able to use leading questions. Build\nthem into your pretext. Plan what you will do in order to lead targets away from the things you don't\nwant them to notice.\nIn OpOfficeSpace, I didn't want Beth to take too long staring at my badge. If it wasn't a match for a\nreal badge, she would have noticed, so I quickly used my pen and a work order to lead her to where I\nwanted her to focus. This was powerful, and allowed me to not only redirect, but to add legitimacy to\nmy claims.\n128\nAssumptive Questions\nAnother way a social engineer can collect intel during elicitation is to use assumptive statements and\nquestions. You can use these types of questions when you have some knowledge and can make an\nassumption to confirm that knowledge with a question or statement.\nThis is another technique I have used with my kids to find out details that aren't clear. For example:\nMe: So, when you were at the party, did Tammy show up?\nMy child: Not 'til later that night—you don't have to worry, Dad.\nThat brief exchange let me know my son was at the party, so I could continue to probe in that\ndirection to get more information.\nAs a professional social engineer, assumptive questions can be used upon the initial approach in\norder to bypass certain conversation-stoppers. A conversation-stopper is just what it sounds like: a\nstatement or statements that are made with the intent to stop someone from moving past a\nparticular person or area.\nIn OpOfficeSpace, I used assumptions with both Alicia and Beth upon initial approach. I assumed I\nbelonged where I was and that they should have known why I was there and that they should have\nallowed it. I didn't use arrogance or anger—just an air of belonging, as if I knew where I was going\nand exactly why I was there.\nSummary\nA conversation is like an onion—both have many layers. As you peel back one layer, you can get\ndeeper and deeper to the center.\nEach elicitation technique is an important part of a conversation. Learning how to use each can help\nyou become a master at conversation and a superb social engineer. The goal of elicitation is to\nextract information in a normal-sounding conversation. If you practice these skills, that is exactly\nwhat you will be able to do. The fascinating thing is that this is not limited to verbal conversations—\nthese same skills work whether you are having a conversation over email, chat, text, phone, or any\nother means.\nJust as a chef decides what tools and ingredients to use to make a dish, you can sprinkle a few\nquestions into your conversation, add a dash of deliberate false statements, and mix in a healthy\ndose of mutual interest to elicit the information you need.\nAs you begin to master this skill you will be serving up perfect dishes of elicitation and conversation.\nWith that arrow in your quiver, the last one you need is the one I describe in the next chapter:\nreading nonverbals and body language.\n129",

    "text": "8\nI Can See What You Didn't Say\nIt is our responsibility to learn to become emotionally intelligent. These are skills, they're not\neasy, nature didn't give them to us—we have to learn them.\n—DR. PAUL EKMAN\nWhen I wrote my first book, Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking (Wiley, 2010), I was\nrelatively new to the world of nonverbals. But I had started a relationship with Dr. Paul Ekman and\nlearned from him as my mentor. Dr. Paul Ekman started his journey to understand nonverbals in\nthe late 1950s, and for the last 60-plus years he has been leading the field of research into nonverbal\ncommunications.\nDr. Ekman helped me refine not only my work, but also how I communicated. That led to my second\nbook, Unmasking the Social Engineer: The Human Element of Security (Wiley, 2014), which delves\ndeep into facial expressions, body language, hand gestures, and every aspect of nonverbals. I even\ncover the part of nonverbal communication you don't see: the hijacking of the amygdala.\nIf you followed, read, or listened to any of my work before, it is probably not too hard to believe that\nwhen it comes to Dr. Ekman, I pretty much react like what you see in Figure 8-1 when I am around\nhim.\nFigure 8-1 What most people imagine I do when I see Dr. Ekman (not far from the truth).\nPHOTO SOURCE: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror,_March_1957_01.jpg\nI have a few goals with this chapter. First, I want to make sure I uphold Dr. Ekman's high standards\nof ensuring everything I say can be backed up with research. Second, I don't want to just duplicate\neither of my previous books, especially if you have read one or both of them. In this book, I present\nnonverbals from one key area that can literally change your life as a social engineer: the\nunderstanding of baseline changes between comfort and discomfort.\nIn this chapter, I smash any preconceived false notions you have had about certain body language\ntells and show you what exactly to look for as a socia engineering professional.\nNonverbals Are Essential\nBefore I get to the meat of this chapter, let me help you see why it's important to understand how to\nread nonverbal communication. Of course, the best way to do this is to tell a story.\n130\nWhen I was working with Dr. Ekman on Unmasking the Social Engineer, his role was to make sure\nthat what I was saying was scientifically accurate, made sense, was logical, and was approved via his\ndecades of research.\nI had written a chapter about one study that had been done on mirror neurons. The study basically\nstated that the researchers believed there was a group of neurons in the brain that had the role of\nmirroring the nonverbals they see from other people.\nBased on research from Dr. Ekman, we know that when we feel an emotion, we have an involuntary\nreaction, and that reaction is displayed by microexpressions. In addition, when we make facial\nexpressions, we create the emotion attached to that expression.\nI made the connection that if mirror neurons make us mirror someone's expressions—which are\naccompanied by emotions—we can control emotional content of our targets.\nWhile I was writing Unmasking the Social Engineer, there was a scientific debate going on over\nmirror neurons and the research behind it. Consequently, Dr. Ekman wrote me a very nice email in\nwhich he basically said, “Do you want your book to have outdated or disproved research in it if this\nresearch gets quashed?”\nI responded with, “But, but, but … I already have, like, 40 pages written all about it. And the chapter\nis due in five days.” I hoped Dr. Ekman would basically respond, “Okay, that's cool.”\nInstead, he said, “Well, then I guess you have five days to read this research here on the amygdala\nand write a chapter on that.” And with that, I had about 60 pages of information on something I\ncould barely pronounce to research, understand, and write about.\nOf course, Dr. Ekman helped me greatly, but there was a lesson or three in this for me.\nIt is important to understand how things work if I am going to truly help my clients.\nIt is important to adapt and grow with new research.\nSleep is really underrated.\nWhile writing that chapter on amygdala hijacking, I again saw a connection in the research between\nplanting emotional content and controlling a target's response. If the amygdala processes emotional\nstimuli before the brain has a chance to “turn on,” and I can cause the target to feel slight sadness or\nfear, then I can take advantage of their empathetic response.\nIn other words, mastering the use of pretexts can help me elicit the emotions I want in my subjects; I\ncan make them feel how I want them to feel. Now we are getting to the point, finally, of why\nunderstanding nonverbals is so important.\nWhen I'm about to break into a place as part of a job, or I'm about to do some vishing, I feel some\npretty intense fear: fear of failure, fear of being caught, fear of messing up. Let's examine the\nemotion I feel.\nHow does fear affect me physiologically?\nMy eyes are open wide and my eyelids are tense.\nMy mouth pulls back in an “eek” shape, and I take in sharp breaths.\nMy muscles tense and often freeze as I prepare for fight or flight.\nMy heart rate elevates.\nMy sweat production increases.\nNow, let's discuss what my physiological state should be to elicit the desired emotional response\nfrom my target (which, as I previously mentioned, would be slight sadness to elicit empathy:\nMy eyes are soft and not tense.\nMy lips are turned down at the corners.\nMy head is lowered.\nMy muscles are not tense.\nMy breathing becomes shallower.\nDo you see the difference? If my pretext is using the emotion of sadness, but my body language is\nshowing fear, what happens to the target? I would guess that the majority of people will never think,\n131\n“Wow, this person is using a sadness-based story but showing fear. That is incongruent emotional\ncontent, which makes me feel uneasy.” However, we all have internal radar that tells us when we feel\n(or should feel) like raising the shields and being more defensive. If I showed fear but tried to elicit\nsadness and empathy, my target's radar would throw up that shield.\nA truly phenomenal study titled “Chemosensory Cues to Conspecific Emotional Stress Activate\nAmygdala in Humans” (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2713432) proves this in an …\nuh … interesting way.\nThe researchers collected sweat pads from folks who had exercised. Then they collected sweat pads\nfrom a group of people who had jumped out of a plane at 13,000 feet in a tandem skydive. Then the\nresearchers tested a group of subjects by attaching an fMRI to their heads and having them sniff\neach of the sweat pads. (Gross, but true.)\nWhen this test group sniffed the sweat pads from the group who had jumped from a plane, the\nsubjects' fear center, namely the amygdala, was triggered. When the subjects sniffed the pads from\nthe exercise group, no fear was triggered. So, the old adage that you can smell fear is actually true.\nNow that we know that other people can sense our fear, let's think about what I need to do as I get\nready to approach a target. I have two choices:\nLearn to control my fear so I can display the proper emotion.\nIf that is not possible, build a pretext that uses my natural emotion.\nTHINK ABOUT THIS\nAt DEF CON 25, we had Tim Larkin as our guest in our live episode of The Social-\nEngineer Podcast. Tim told a story about a Muslim woman who was walking\ntoward a group of young men. The men didn't say anything to the woman, but\nsomething about them made her feel uneasy. So, she did the smart thing, and\nturned and started to walk the other direction.\nHowever, she left her earbuds in, therefore taking away her advantage. One of the\nyoung men ran up behind her and cold-cocked her in the back, which knocked her\nout.\nThis is a sad and grotesque story, but it speaks to the point about how our internal\nradars work even though we sometimes try to quiet the warning signs. I always\nsay don't ignore that radar—listen to it because it can save your life.\nUnderstanding this can help you have a better grasp on your emotions to know what you're\ndisplaying and learn how to use, read, and then react properly to emotions and the nonverbal\nproducts of those emotions as a professional social engineer.\nBefore I get into the details about nonverbals, you first need to understand how to interpret\nemotional baselines.\nAll Your Baselines Belong to Us\nBeing able to read someone's emotional content can truly enhance your communication ability. I\nwant to focus on how observing changes in baselines help the professional social engineer.\nLet me first define a baseline. Simply put, it's the emotional content you see being displayed at the\nmoment you start observing. You are not looking to understand their lifelong baseline. So, breathe—\nI'm not asking you to stalk your targets for months or years before each test.\nLook at Figure 8-2. Amaya did something that wasn't too great, and her mom is letting her know.\n132\nFigure 8-2 What baselines do you see here?\nWhat do you observe? In Figure 8-2, what is the emotional content of my wife, Areesa? Do you see\nthe tight jaw? The pointed finger and terse lips? She's signaling anger.\nAnd what about Amaya? Her arms are folded, her chin is up in the air, and her face expresses\nirritation. She is closed off and not really in a listening mood.\nNow look at Figure 8-3 to see what Amaya looks like after that “discussion” ends and Areesa and\nAmaya have parted ways.\n133\nFigure 8-3 What change do you see here?\nAmaya looks a bit saddened and self-comforting. Maybe she's even reflecting on the argument.\nNow look at Figure 8-4. Amaya and Areesa just got done enjoying a nice cup of tea and talking about\ntheir fun day of shopping.\nFigure 8-4 What baselines do you see in this one?\nWhat baselines exist here? Both look happy. They're leaning into each other and enjoying the\nconversation.\nThe three photos show the same people in different circumstances and displaying different\nbaselines. Herein lies a very valuable lesson. A baseline is not a person's personality definition. It's\nnot a psych profile. It doesn't cover the long term. The baseline is merely the emotional content\nbeing displayed at a specific moment.\nBeing able to read a person's emotional state at the moment you approach that person is vital for\nyou as a social engineer. Your approach to target Areesa from Figure 8-2 to Figure 8-4 would have to\nvary greatly if you want to succeed.\nMany times, I've have heard people say that they can be taught to tell the difference between lying\nand truth in a matter of seconds.\nDr. David Matsumoto, Dr. Hyi Sung Hwang, Dr. Lisa Skinner, and Dr. Mark Frank wrote an article\ntitled “Evaluating Truthfulness and Detecting Deception”\n(https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/evaluating-truthfulness-and-\ndetecting-deception) in which they make a very important point: “It is not the mere presence or\nabsence of behaviors, such as gaze aversion or fidgeting, that indicates lying. Rather, it is how these\nnonverbal cues change over time from a person's baseline and how they combine with the\nindividual's words. And, when just the behavioral cues from these sources are considered, they\naccurately differentiate between lying and truth telling.”\nDo you clearly grasp their assertion? There's not some mystical tell that always indicates a lie or\ntruth. How a person's cues change over time indicates the content of the emotion and way we should\ndecipher it.\nBe Careful of Misconceptions\n134\nPeople often hold some preconceived misconceptions about certain body language “tells” that you\nneed to understand and get rid of before you venture down this road. If you don't, you'll end up\nmaking some bad assumptions.\nLet's analyze some examples together. Look at Figure 8-5. What do you see?\nFigure 8-5 Is Amaya upset or not?\nFor years, people have been told that folded arms are a clear indicator of being closed off. That is not\nnecessarily true. If someone changes from an open display to a closed-off position as I approach,\nthat might be true, but some people routinely sit or stand like with their arms crossed because it's\ncomfortable and not because they are closed off. On both sides of Figure 8-5, Amaya's arms are\nfolded, but her facial expression and position of her head indicate which emotion she feels.\nNow look at Figure 8-6.\n135\nFigure 8-6 Is she irritated, about to lie, cold, or comfortable?\nYou can't see it in this still picture, but Amaya's leg was bouncing at about 500 beats per minute. Is\nthis a sign of deception about to occur? Or maybe she is not comfortable? It's hard to tell. Some\npeople just have busy legs or move a lot. Again, notice when a movement like this starts and observe\nhow often it starts or stops to figure out what it means. Look at the whole picture in Figure 8-6:\nAmaya's body position, her leg bounce, her hand on the back of her neck. When you consider all the\nelements, you might decide that Amaya is looking uncomfortable.\nMy son Colin's leg is like a perpetual motion machine. I've always thought that if we could attach it\nto a generator, we could produce power for our home. He's not deceptive; he just moves a lot. Here\nis an example of how I used this knowledge about Colin's habits:\nI said, “Hey, Colin, how did the party go the other night? Did you have fun?”\nColin, with his leg drilling a hole through the earth, would say, “Yeah, it was okay. Nothing too\nmuch.”\nNow, in this case, I knew there had been a fight with Stewart, and I wanted to get details. I would\nsay, “Oh, cool. Who was there again?”\n136\nColin listed all the people there, but he left out Stewart. Hmm. I replied, “Oh, so Stewart wasn't\nthere? I thought he was going.”\nNow Colin's leg stopped dead, “Yeah, he was there too,” he said, as his leg started moving again.\n“Oh. Is everything okay with Stewart?” I asked.\nWith his leg now firmly planted on the ground, Colin said, “Yeah, fine.” This time, there was a pause\nbefore Colin started to move his leg again.\nThe indicator that there was a problem was not that Colin's leg was moving, but that it had stopped.\nFrom there, it was a matter of a few seconds before I had the whole story.\nPRO TIP\nDon't write about your methods to get your kids to talk until they are old enough\nto have either figured it out or you no longer use those tactics. In our house, it is\nlike a constant battle of wits to see who will win. So far, I am way ahead. If we\nwere keeping score, I'd say it's now PARENTS: 5,981,387 to KIDS: 5.\nP.S. My daughter disagrees with this score and says the numbers are reversed.\nNow take a look at Figure 8-7 and see what you can interpret.\n137\nFigure 8-7 Is this comfort or discomfort?\nFace rubbing, scratching, or other types of manipulators can be indicators of discomfort, but\nsometimes people just have an itchy face. Notice when it starts and why.\nI can use my son Colin for this example, too. He had asthma and allergies. There were many times\nwhen his skin itched all over. When it was pollen season, Colin was always touching or scratching\nhis face. In this case, the fidgeting wasn't because Colin was lying but because of his allergies.\nIf we play into these misconceptions, we can fall into a trap of assigning emotional content where it\ndoesn't exist. That can be dangerous because you can start to react to emotion that isn't there. You\ndon't want to treat someone as if they are closed off when they are just cold, or assume that someone\nis being deceptive when their behavior is the results of having allergies.\nThe best way to combat this error is to approach each situation without using preconceived\njudgments, even if you're approaching a target you've interacted with before. Reserve your\njudgments for after the initial 15 to 20 seconds of the encounter.\nWhen it comes to body language, I try to focus on the changes from baselines and then look for a\n138\nchange that indicates comfort versus discomfort. In Unmasking the Social Engineer, I wrote\nextensively about facial expressions and body language, so if you want to learn more about that\nsubject, you can check out that book.\nFor this book, I want to give you just the basics of understanding the difference between comfort\nand discomfort. Once you have a clear grasp of what those indicators look like, you will have a map\nthat tells you what to look for and how to decipher what you see.\nKnow the Basic Rules\nThis section covers four good rules for you to keep in mind when reading body language. If you\napply these, you will see a massive difference in how you read and interpret body language.\nThese rules are not meant to be “math” in the sense that you must do 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, but they all must\nbe done if you want to master reading nonverbals.\nRule 1: Focus on the What—Not the Why\nThis rule is straightforward: Don't make connections between the what and why without having all\nthe information.\nI often start off my nonverbal training day with helping students remember one thing: “Just because\nyou can see the what does not mean you know the why.”\nThink about this: While I'm speaking to the class, I say something as I make eye contact with you. I\nnotice you fold your arms, your eyebrows go down while your eyes remain open, and your jaw\ntightens. I notice tension in your arms and hands. All these signs point to anger or discomfort.\nI can assume you're feeling angry or uncomfortable about me or something I said. However, maybe\nyou're reacting to pain you just felt because of surgery you had last year. Or maybe you have a\nstomach cramp that made you angry. Or maybe you weren't even paying attention, and you thought\nabout something that made you mad.\nRegardless of the reason for your body language, how do I connect the what to the why? As I discuss\nin Chapter 7, “Building Your Artwork,” it's all about questions. In a classroom scenario, it's not\nappropriate for me to stop my lecture to enquire about why you looked angry.\nRule 2: Examine the Clusters\nWhen you start to practice engaging with targets, it's easy to look at one particular body-language\nmovement or facial expression and think you can understand what is being communicated.\nHowever, focusing on one cue is dangerous. You need context and other body language cues to\nindicate what is really being said. Look for matching nonverbal clusters that indicate what emotion\nis being displayed.\nConsider this scenario: You're talking to your spouse and telling them that you disagree with a\ndecision. As you're stating your opinion, your spouse folds his or her arms. Does this automatically\nmean they are shut off, angry, or not liking what they are hearing?\nExpand your view a bit. Do you see anger on your spouse's face? Do you see a change in the\nplacement of their hips and feet, so that they're now pointing away from you? What are the other\nemotional “clusters” that can help you to pinpoint if the arm-folding was an isolated movement or\npart of a larger emotional tell?\nRule 3: Look for Congruence\nLook for congruence between verbal and nonverbal communication. If someone shakes his head no\nbut says the word yes, those two indicators are telling you that things are not congruent.\nWhen you identify a lack of congruence in the information you perceive about someone, rely on the\nnonverbal messaging to indicate what is truly being said. Examining the nonverbal clusters and\nlooking for a lack of congruency between nonverbal communication and the verbal communication.\nwill help you get very close to accurately reading what the target is telling you.\nRule 4: Pay Attention to the Context\n139\nLet's say I look out my office window and see my daughter sitting outside. She has made herself\nsmall, sitting almost in a ball. Her arms are folded across her chest, and her chin is down. Her head\nis tucked low into her folded arms. All of these are signs of sadness and discomfort.\nWhat I didn't tell you is that it's only 35 degrees Fahrenheit outside, and she was not wearing a\nproper jacket.\nIn context, you understand that Amaya is cold. Without the contextual detail about the temperature,\nshe seems sad and uncomfortable. To avoid misreading the nonverbals, you must understand the\ncontext of the situation your target is in.\nIn addition to these four rules, there are some body language basics you need to know before I get\ninto details about each emotion.\nUnderstand the Basics of Nonverbals\nThere are some basic things that you should understand as you start down the path of nonverbals.\nThese basic characteristics are applicable to all humans and not tied to a specific culture, gender,\nrace, or religion. Understanding these basics will help you to understand how our bodies\ncommunicate exactly what we are feeling regardless of what we are trying to display.\nExternal stimuli come into our brain through our five modalities, assuming one is not damaged:\nsight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing. These stimuli are processed by our brains, and the stimuli can\ntrigger one of the seven base emotions: anger, fear, surprise, disgust, contempt, sadness, or\nhappiness. The emotion that is triggered creates physiological responses in both our faces and our\nbodies.\nFor example, when a person is confident, they make themselves bigger, which elevates testosterone\nand decreases cortisol in the blood, according to a study titled “Postural Influences on the Hormone\nLevel in Healthy Subjects” by researchers R.S.Minvaleev, A.D.Nozdrachev, V.V.Kir'yanova and\nA.I.Ivanov. (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:HUMP.0000036341.80214.28). The\nresearchers wanted to test whether certain yoga poises increased or decreased cortisol, testosterone,\ndehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and aldosterone. For our purpose, let's focus on cortisol and\ntestosterone.\nThe researchers found that just by holding certain poses that are associated with confident\nbehaviors, a person's testosterone increased by more than 16% and their cortisol dropped by 11%.\nCoincidentally, testosterone is known to increase behaviors that would be associated with a\nconfident person. So, almost as a self-fulfilling prophecy, it appears that holding confident poses\nreleases chemicals that help you feel and act more confident.\nNOTE\nCortisol is a hormone that regulates a wide variety of processes in the body,\nincluding metabolism and immune responses. Cortisol is often called the \"stress\nhormone\" because of its connection to the body's response to stress. Researchers\nhave found that high levels of cortisol are linked to anxiety and depression.\nIn essence, what is important for you to understand is: It appears that comfort-based nonverbals\nassist in creating happy, confident, and strong chemical and physiological reactions, whereas\ndiscomfort-based nonverbals can create stress, anxiety, and negative emotion–based reactions.\nIt is important to understand how certain nonverbals can affect both you and your target. As a\nprofessional social engineer, you are influencing or manipulating the emotional content of your\ntarget. Do not take this lightly.\nBecause the effect of your pretext on your target can be short-term or long-lasting, it is important to\nplan your pretexts carefully. Remember the motto: Leave them feeling better for having met you.\nWhenever possible, try to use pretexts that trigger emotional content that will not have a long-\nlasting, damaging effect on your targets.\nHow can you determine if the pretext you choose might have long-lasting negative effects? Try to\n140\ndetermine what emotion you are basing your pretext on. Fear, anger, disgust, and contempt are so\nstrong as negative emotions that you risk a greater chance of leaving the target damaged for having\nmet you.\nFor example, there is a difference in a phish that says, “Thank you for your recent order of this 55-\ninch TV,” and one that says, “Your account has been hacked and your bank account has been\nemptied.”\nUnderstanding that nonverbals and emotions can affect the target profoundly should help you\ndetermine how to use these emotions during your social engineering gigs. To this effect, one of the\nmost profound lessons I learned from Dr. Ekman is that not only does having an emotion trigger a\nnonverbal response, but if you were to force the nonverbal on yourself, you can trigger the emotion.\nThis concept was backed up by numerous researchers, including in a study titled “Inhibiting and\nFacilitating Conditions of the Human Smile: A Nonobtrusive Test of the Facial Feedback\nHypothesis” (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3379579). Researchers Strack, Martin, and Stepper\ntested Dr. Ekman's hypothesis from the 1970s and 1980s and were able to show that if you create\nthe expression, you can trigger the emotion. They did this by asking subjects to put a pen in their\nmouth to trigger muscular usage that simulated a smile. They were able to prove the same thing that\nDr. Ekman stated in his research: Creating the facial expression (even by force) creates the emotion\nassociated with it.\nThe key point to remember is that if you create an emotion, or you cause the target to express that\nemotion, you can leave the target feeling that emotion. You have to exercise caution when using this\nsuper power.\nComfort vs. Discomfort\nIt is important to learn how to communicate effectively, and part of that communication is\nnonverbal. There are some researchers who have developed statistics about how much of what we\nsay is nonverbal. I have heard 80%, 85%, and even 90%, but one of the things I learned from Dr.\nEkman was that, even though we can all agree that a large percentage of communication is\nnonverbal, the method of communication (spoken, written, in person) affects the way nonverbals\nare used.\nWhat our bodies and faces show during normal communications can be overwhelming to people\nwho can recognize the emotion being displayed. During normal communication, a person's body\nand face can display a myriad of emotions, and trying to interpret them can be overwhelming. For\nthis reason, when you first start out as a social engineer, it's best to focus on the nonverbals that are\nthe easiest to interpret: comfort and discomfort.\nFor this book I am trying something I haven't tried in my other books. I'm coming at this topic from\nthe angle of the emotion and then discussing whether you, as a social engineer, would want to\ntrigger this emotion in your targets. I explain how to look for signs that could indicate the comfort or\ndiscomfort displays that are associated with that emotion. I've divided this section by each emotion\nand described some of the indicators of that emotion in the face and the body. This is not meant to\nbe an exhaustive list of every movement, but it provides a foundational basis for you to build on as\nyou practice and begin to master this skill.\nIn addition to studying this section to learn how to read body language in others, you should use this\ninformation to learn how your body language can affect your targets. If you are displaying the\nemotions that I describe in this section, then you can trigger those emotions in others. Decide what\nemotions you want to trigger, and then practice the nonverbals for those emotions. Also learn to\nrecognize the emotions and triggers that you do not want to elicit in others.\nAnger\nAnger is a strong emotion that has been labeled as a gateway emotion. What this means is that many\ntimes, anger leads to other emotions, feelings, or actions. Those actions can range from using\nexpletives or angry words and escalate all the way up to exhibiting violent behavior.\nPhysiologically, anger makes us tense, tight, and ready to fight or defend. Muscles tense, the jaw\ntightens, and the person might clench their fists—all in a preparation for a fight or defense. As the\nperson gets closer to taking a violent action, you might even see their chin lower in a protective\n141\nmeasure to protect the neck.\nAlthough things are tense and tight, you might notice a person who is experiencing anger try to\nmake themselves larger. For example, an angry person might expand their chest, square their\nshoulders, and widen their stance. In addition, their breathing deepens and their heart rate\nincreases.\nSomeone who is angry has the following facial characteristics:\nThe brows will furrow, but the eyes don't squint. They open wide.\nThe jaw tightens.\nThe teeth clench, or, if the mouth is open, the person is often not saying pleasant things.\nYou can see all of this represented in Figure 8-8.\nFigure 8-8 Anger in the face\nAnger can also be displayed in the rest of the body. Figure 8-9 shows me with a tight jaw and\nclenched fists. In addition, my chest is puffed to make me look bigger. All of this points to anger.\n(FYI: This is the very picture I will hand to any boy that shows interest in Amaya.) If you notice any\nof these signs as you approach a person, it might be best to avoid that individual.\n142\nFigure 8-9 Anger in the body\nAnother version of anger is shown in Figure 8-10, in which Amaya is displaying subtle anger. Her\nglare, tight jaw, and slightly furrowed brow are all signs of anger.\n143\nFigure 8-10 Subtle anger\nMost likely, you can figure out that anger is a discomfort nonverbal. It's one that I particularly do\nnot like to elicit in my targets. Consequently, I watch for signs of this emotion and try to not use it in\nmy engagements.\nMany times, if I am too aggressive in my approach or if my pretext is too negative, I can catch signs\nof anger. It is a great warning sign to back off and to soften my voice or body language to alleviate\nsome of the anger feelings in my target.\nDisgust\nDisgust is also a very strong emotion. Disgust can be felt toward a person, place, or thing.\nOftentimes, something that makes us have a very strong disgust reaction sticks with us for a very\nlong time after we've been exposed to it.\nWhen I was a young boy, my parents raised chickens. I would love to run out to the hen house, grab\na couple fresh eggs, and make what I intelligently called “egg in bread.” It was simply a piece of\nbuttered bread in a pan with an egg in the middle.\nOne day, I grabbed my egg and cracked it open in my super-heated cast-iron pan. What came out\nwas not a fresh egg but a half-formed chick. As it hit the pan, it started to flop around as it died. The\nsight and the smell made me heave into the sink. Because I was so disgusted, I forgot to shut the\nburner off, so the poor thing roasted, and the smell of burning chick filled the kitchen.\nThe disgust emotion that was triggered was so strong that even a decade later, the smell of a cooking\negg would make me instantly feel sick. Eventually, I did get over that, but disgust is such a strong\nemotion that if you trigger it in your target, you might not be able to recover.\nThink about the things that can trigger a disgust emotion in your targets: body odor, bodily\nfunctions, food on your face or in your teeth, foul language, word choice, and so on. It's important to\ncarefully analyze your approach and yourself before you approach so you don't cause your target to\nfeel disgust.\nDisgust is exhibited a few different ways. On the face, it is a bilateral expression, meaning that both\nsides of the face show the same expression, as illustrated in Figure 8-11.\n144\nFigure 8-11 Disgust\nAs we were prepping for the pictures, my dog had done something nasty in the living room. I\ncouldn't pass up the opportunity, and I captured a picture of Areesa cleaning up. Notice how the\nsides of her nose are raised, which blocks both the olfactory sense as well as the line of vision. In\nessence, she's physiologically blocking the things that are causing her disgust.\nIn the body, a person demonstrates disgust by blocking or turning away from you. Look for signs of\na lack of interest or repulsion.\nNotice the leg position of Amaya in Figure 8-12. Where is her interest? It's definitely not in her dad\n(as sad as that makes me). And although she's not showing a strong sign of true disgust, her body\nlanguage is showing signs of discomfort and disinterest.\n145\nFigure 8-12 Disinterest\nBecause disgust is such a strong negative emotion, I tend to not use it during engagements.\nHowever, I have been asked about using it to create a tribe of people who are disgusted at the same\nthing. Although this can work and be very powerful, it can also lead to some dangerous results if not\nhandled properly.\nContempt\nContempt is a unique emotion. The Oxford English Dictionary defines contempt as, “The feeling\nthat a person is worthless.” Dr. Ekman offers a simpler definition, stating contempt is the feeling of\nmoral superiority.\nAccording to Dr. Ekman's definition of contempt, it can be felt only toward a person, and it is the\nonly unilateral expression, which means it's shown on only one side of the face. At first, contempt\nmay appear to be a smirk, or even the start of a smile, as shown in Figure 8-13.\n146\nFigure 8-13 Contempt can be confused with happiness.\nContempt is characterized by one side of the face being raised—for example, the corner of the lips is\nraised on only one side as in Figure 8-13. It is not uncommon to see this accompanied by a chin\nraise, even if it's only slight.\nBecause contempt is a feeling of being superior to another person and can often be a gateway into\nanger, you may see the following types of body language with contempt:\nFeeling superior to another person can make someone feel confident. That feeling of confidence\ncan be displayed in several ways, but oftentimes, the person takes up more space by making him-\nor herself bigger.\nIf the contempt has led to anger, you might see the same body language as I described in the\nprevious section. However, before those anger nonverbals are fully displayed, you may notice a\ntightening of the jaw and more aggressive posture.\nIn my opinion, contempt has little to no use in a professional social engineering engagement. I can\nsee how a nation-state might use it, and I have seen how it is used by terror organizations to recruit\nand then convert people to their cause, but for most standard social engineering engagements, it\nwouldn't lead to a desirable outcome.\nNOTE\nTerror organizations will often use the anger that people feel toward their\ngovernments or certain ideologies and convert it to contempt by feeding that\nanger. Once the target is feeling contempt for, or morally superior to, the object\nof the anger, the terror organization gives them the “solution” or “action” that\ncan be taken. It is unbelievably divisive, but it works amazingly well.\nFear\nFear has many purposes, such as it alerts us to danger, but it can also be exhilarating and enjoyable\n147\nwhen controlled. Some people even enjoy being scared or feeling fear.\nFear of disappointment, fear of failure, or fear of making the wrong decision can be useful for a\nprofessional social engineer, but I generally steer clear of stronger uses of fear. Pretexts that literally\nthreaten or scare a person—such as those that cause them to fear for their jobs, lives, or families—\ntrigger such strong emotion that when they find out they were being tested, they can be left with\ndisgust or contempt, followed by anger.\nFear has some clear physical characteristics:\nThe eyes are open wide to take in the whole scene.\nThe body tenses, and there is usually an audible gasp of air.\nThe mouth is open, with the lips pulling back toward the ears as if the person is saying “eek.”\nYou can see these characteristics in Figure 8-14.\nFigure 8-14 A classic fear expression\nIn the body, fear has manifestations similar to the facial expressions. The body pulls back, tenses up,\nfreezes, and prepares for fight or flight. If you startle your target, you might see the person react as\ndepicted in Figure 8-15.\n148\nFigure 8-15 Startled fear in body language\nNotice how Amaya has reeled back with her whole body tensed. Her mouth is in that “eek” position.\nThis type of fear can be intense because there's no physical way for her to flee. She's cornered in her\nchair.\nFigure 8-16 shows another aspect that we see in fear when displayed by women—covering the\nsuprasternal notch.\n149\nFigure 8-16 Covering the suprasternal notch indicates fear.\nWatch for subtle body-language indicators that can clue you in to how the target might be feeling. If\nyou see signs of fear, you can then decide whether the fear being displayed is appropriate and how\nfar you are willing to go to use it. As I mentioned before, I use fear as a professional social engineer,\nbut I steer clear of the type of fear that can leave the target feeling threatened or in harm's way.\nSurprise\nSurprise is often confused with fear because it looks so similar. With surprise, the eyes open wide, as\nthey do in fear. The body generally freezes and the mouth also drops open. But instead of opening\nwith an “eek” shape, the mouth opens in more of an “OHHHHH” shape. You can see this in Figure\n8-17.\n150\nFigure 8-17 Surprise, which can often be misinterpreted as fear\nSurprise can be useful to a professional social engineer, but, as with some of the other emotions I've\nmentioned, it depends on how you use it. I don't suggest hiding in a closet and then jumping out to\nsurprise your targets, but a surprise audit, visit, or reward might work to elicit the right response. In\none engagement, which was solely a vishing engagement, I used a surprise reward to get some\namazing results. The call went something like this:\nTarget: Hello, Beth speaking. How can I help you?\nMe: Beth, this is Paul from HR. I have some great news. You may not have heard, but we\nentered your department into the drawing for a brand-new iPhone, and your name was\npicked!\nTarget: Come on! You're kidding! This is amazing!\nMe: I know. I love these calls. We're giving 10 away, and these calls have been a lot of fun.\nTarget: Yeah, I never win anything. This is amazing!\nMe: As you know, we have a few Beths here at XYZ, so I need to verify some details with you to\nensure that I have the right Beth. Can you spell your full name for me?\nTarget: E-l-i-z-a-b-e-t-h S-m-a-r-s-t-o-n.\nMe: Excellent. I need your employee ID to enter it into the system.\nTarget: T238712P.\nMe: Okay, you're the right Beth. Now I need you to go to a site where you'll be asked to log in\nwith your domain credentials, and you'll tell the site where you want the phone shipped,\netc. Go to iphone.company-website.com. [This was a website we set up that did nothing;\nnone of the buttons worked.]\nTarget: Okay, the site came up. I see our logo, but when I click the Enter button, nothing is\nhappening. What do I do?\nMe: Hmm, I am on it now. When you click Enter, it doesn't go to another screen? I see another\nscreen right now.\nTarget: No. I'm trying a different browser. [Tried every browser she had.] Figures; I win\nsomething and can't even claim it.\nMe: No, we won't stand for that. Look, I'll claim it for you. Do you want me to enter your\ninformation?\nTarget: Really? Would you do that?\nMe: Of course, I would. [Feeling as guilty as a snake.] It's asking for your full name, which I\nhave… .” [I say each letter as I fake typing it in.] Okay, hitting Next. It wants your\n151\nemployee ID—you gave me that, so I'll enter that now.\nTarget: Thank you so much. This is so cool.\nMe: Okay. It wants your domain login, which I assume is just E.Smarston?\nTarget: No, I actually have it as B.Smarston. For Beth …\nMe: Okay, great. Now the last thing I need is your password.\nTarget [without even pausing for a second]: I do really good with long passwords. It's\n“JustinandBeth99”!\nMe: Excellent, that worked. It says you'll get an email within 24 hours with further\ninstructions on what to do to claim the phone. Congratulations, Beth!\nTarget: Thank you so much!\nWith that, we had a full compromise of the network. Yes—for all of you who are preparing your hate\nmail—that was manipulative and used a pretext that made the target a little upset when she found\nout about it later. But, remember, I didn't threaten her; I didn't embarrass her; I didn't cause her\nharm. I used a surprise to trigger a happiness-based emotion, and that led her to give all sorts of\ninformation to me without thinking.\nFrom a body-language perspective, there are a few things that you may notice that indicate surprise.\nThese are shown in Figure 8-18 and Figure 8-19.\nFigure 8-18 Surprise may cause a person to lean back with raised facial expressions.\n152\nFigure 8-19 Shock, a form of surprise, might be indicated by a person covering their mouth.\nIn my opinion, surprise is a good emotion for a professional social engineer. With the proper\nplanning and execution, it can lead to large victories for you.\nSadness\nSadness is a very complex emotion. It also has a huge range, as it can span from feeling slightly blue\nto utter despair. As a social engineer, there are a few ways that you can use sadness:\nNoticing sadness in a target and then using that emotion to elicit a reaction\nCreating a situation that will most likely cause the target to feel sadness and lead to them to react\nthe way you want them to\nDisplaying sadness in your own nonverbals to elicit an empathy-based response\nSome of these methods employ a more manipulative approach than others. It all depends on how\nyou employ these emotions and what the resultant emotional state of the person you use this on.\nSadness has a few facial indicators, which are demonstrated in Figure 8-20.\n153\nFigure 8-20 Facial elements of sadness\nOn the face, sadness is shown by\nThe corners of the mouth turning down\nThe eyelids drooping\nThe corners of the eyebrows coming together and going up\nIn some extreme cases of sadness, you can read the emotion from just one part of face.\nSadness can also be conveyed by a person's body. Sadness makes us want to protect, comfort, and\nbecome smaller—the opposite responses of feeling confident.\nSome examples of self-comforting nonverbal displays are shown in Figure 8-21, Figure 8-22, and\nFigure 8-23.\n154\nFigure 8-21 Self comforting hug\n155\nFigure 8-22 Eye blocking\n156\nFigure 8-23 Slumped body language\nThis is a short list, but you get the idea. These nonverbals can help you see that the person is feeling\ndefinite discomfort.\nSadness, in all of its complexity, can be very useful for a social engineer—both in learning how to\nread it and displaying it. However, I caution you to temper how you use this emotion and to what\nlevel you use it in your pretexts.\nI never want to leave my targets with an overwhelming feeling of sorrow or grief, but using the\nproper level of sadness can elicit a strong empathetic response. In a study conducted by Jorge A.\nBarraza and Paul J. Zak titled “Empathy towards Strangers Triggers Oxytocin Release and\nSubsequent Generosity,”\n(https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04504.x),\nthe researchers showed that there was a 47% increase in oxytocin release when empathy was\ntriggered, even when the empathetic feeling was between complete strangers, whereas sadness can\ncreate a lack of serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin in the brain. As a professional, I try to stick to the\nempathy side of sadness instead of the worry, grief, or depression side of the spectrum.\n157\nJust think about how many times this tactic is used in marketing and charity drives. From homeless\nchildren to abused animals, the goal is to trigger an empathetic response to encourage you to more\neasily decide to part with your money. This doesn't mean those organizations are being dishonest or\nmanipulative—they just know how our brains work, and it helps them achieve their goal.\nHappiness\nHappiness is one emotion that we can all agree is very useful to all human interactions. When we\nfeel happy, content, at peace, or relaxed, we are more prone to make more altruistic decisions. We\ntend to like the people, places, or things that make us feel this emotion.\nFor that reason, it is easy to see that, as a social engineer, happiness would be one emotion you want\nto master reading and eliciting. The first thing that can really help you to see if you are doing a good\njob and creating happiness is learning to identify the difference between a real smile and a fake\nsmile. The one thing that separates a real smile from a fake smile is the activation of the orbicularis\noculi muscle. When triggered, this muscle raises your cheeks and forms what we call “crow's feet”\naround the eyes.\nIn the mid-1800s, a French researcher named Guillaume Duchenne postulated that a real smile\ncould be faked. He was studying neuroscience with the use of a very invasive form of electroshock.\nHe administered shocks to stimulate muscle movement\n(www.thevintagenews.com/2016/05/07/44782-2).\nDue to the pain involved, Duchenne did not get too far with this research, but his research into how\nemotions were displayed through facial expressions showed that the face is a roadmap to emotion.\nAround 1855, he developed a method to use electroshock stimulation to trigger muscular response,\nand he wrote about his findings in Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine. The result was what you\nsee in Figure 8-24.\nFigure 8-24 A fake real smile\nPHOTO SOURCE HTTPS://PUBLICDOMAINREVIEW.ORG/COLLECTIONS/THE-MECHANISM-OF-HUMAN-PHYSIOGNOMY FROM\nMÉCANISME DE LA PHYSIONOMIE HUMAINE\nReading about this research can help you understand why happiness produces the facial expression\nknown as smiling. But as a professional social engineer, you need to learn to recognize other body-\nlanguage indicators of happiness.\nHow is the emotion of happiness displayed by a person's body language? If happiness releases\nstrong neuro chemicals and creates a confident environment, then we can expect to see certain body\n158\nexpressions, too. Look for body postures like those shown in Figure 8-25, Figure 8-26, and Figure 8-\n27.\nFigure 8-25 Notice the open, confident arm position.\n159\nFigure 8-26 Open ventral displays indicate trust and happiness.\n160\nFigure 8-27 Open ventral displays are often associated with welcoming or cordial greetings.\nNOTE\nVentral is the underside of an animal—or the vulnerable side. In humans, this\nmeans our wrists, jugular, and areas of our body we would naturally protect from\nattack.\nOn the face, we look for the eyes to be engaged in the smile in addition to the mouth forming a\nclosed- or open-mouthed smile (see Figure 8-28). Many times, people who feel happy also lean in\ntoward the object of their happiness.\n161\nFigure 8-28 Happiness on the face shown by a genuine smile and head tilt\nOther signs of happiness might include things like raising the toes or bouncing on the balls of the\nfeet. When people feel confident or good, they tend to make themselves bigger or bounce more.\nHappiness is one of the emotions I look to use frequently as a professional social engineer.\nAppealing to a person's ego is a great way to create happiness that can lead to an emotional decision.\nFor this to work, though, the ego appeal must be realistic, believable, and appropriate to the level of\nrapport you have built at that moment.\nI find that, if it fits my pretext, approaching a target with open ventral displays and a warm smile\nwith a proper head tilt can go a long way in making the target feel comfortable with me.\nLook for ways to create a happy environment in your social engineering pretexts, and you will be\nrewarded with good results.\nSummary\nNonverbals are a complex and huge topic that I realize can't be covered in a relatively short chapter.\nAs I mentioned in the outset, my hope is that by going through a high-level overview of this\ninformation, you could walk away with a few different things in your arsenal. Understanding how\nemotion works will benefit you for many pretexts. The more you understand about what someone is\nsaying without using words can help you to understand their communications much more clearly.\nHere are the main ideas that I hope you take away from this chapter:\nFoundational Tools As a starting point, this chapter can help you learn what subtle things to\nlook for in the face and body for each emotion.\nBetter Understanding I hope you have a better idea of which emotions will work for you and\nhow to not only see those emotions in others but display them yourself.\nDefense Understanding how emotions are conveyed through facial expressions and body\nlanguage can also be very helpful for you as a defense mechanism. Realizing how these emotions\ncan and are being used will make you more aware when they are being used against you.\nEnhancement As a professional social engineer, it is essential for you to always be learning and\n162\nenhancing your skill set.\nI want to tell you one more story about social engineering that might help solidify the ideas of this\nchapter. During one DEF CON, I had an interaction with an employee that helped me see how\nimportant it is to be observant of nonverbals all the time.\nThe conference is always a busy time for me and my team. I feel like I rarely get a break or even a\nfew minutes to myself during those five days. I just flip the switch “on” and leave it there as I feed off\nthe energy and positive vibes from the crowd.\nThis is powerful for me, but it can also make me unaware of others' feelings. I bounce around,\nbarking out orders and making sure things are getting done. At this one conference, I had given a\nfew orders to some of the employees to get things packed up. It was our last day, and we were\nrushing to get everything organized so we could go out and have our final team dinner at our\nfavorite sushi place.\nThings were going smoothly; everything was running 100% perfectly. We needed to do the closing\nceremonies, and then we could finally decompress. I was trying to be more aware of others'\nemotions, and I noticed one person's face registered not just fatigue but utter exhaustion. Another\nperson was expressing some serious distress.\nTo the first person, I said, “Hey, if you are really tired, you know you can request to sit out of this\npart—you don't need to come to closing.”\n“What? Really? I could have opted out?” he asked with utter surprise.\n“Yeah, bro—I just thought that was a given. Sorry I didn't mention it before.”\n“I had no clue we could opt out. I thought it was mandatory,” he said.\n“Well, it's only mandatory for Michele. The rest—you can opt out.”\nThen there was a huge sigh of relief from my employee.\nWhen I approached the next person, I needed to be delicate. I couldn't call her out without creating\nproblems in front of others. The emotion I was reading on her was a mix of sadness, anger, and fear.\nI approached her privately, pulling her away from the group, and asked if she was okay. I won't\ndescribe the interaction in detail, but there were a lot of tears. She was feeling stress because she felt\nlike things got dropped or ignored. And she was very stressed due to the lack of downtime.\nSo, I learned a new lesson. During that last day of the conference, I was being particularly observant\nand attentive to my team's emotions. However, I realized that I should have been using this skill\nthroughout all five days of the conference to notice issues before we got to that level of stress.\nLet me apply this story to social engineering: Be observant, but not just during the engagement.\nLook for “flags,” but also be observant during all communications. Be observant for changes in the\nbaseline and for emotional leakage that can help you see what a person might be feeling before,\nduring, and even after your interaction.\nBeing able to read nonverbals is a powerful skill. When you add the ability to use nonverbals to elicit\nemotions in your targets, you have achieved almost superhero level.\nThis concludes the chapters in which I outline the majority of the skills I use as a professional social\nengineer. In the next chapter, you'll learn how you can apply these skills to social engineering\npenetration testing. What vectors can these skills apply to? That is the very topic of the next chapter.\n163",
    "question": "What is the key concept discussed in the text regarding the importance of understanding baseline changes in nonverbal communication for a social engineer?",
    "summary": "The text discusses the importance of emotional intelligence and nonverbal communication in social engineering, emphasizing the need to understand and interpret emotional baselines. It highlights the role of Dr. Paul Ekman's research in refining the understanding of nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions and body language, which can influence a target's emotional state. The author also stresses the importance of being aware of these cues during interactions and using them to create appropriate emotional responses in targets, while avoiding harmful or misinterpreted emotions like fear, anger, and contempt."

    "text": "9\nHacking the Humans\nIf money is your hope for independence you will never have it. The only real security that a man\nwill have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability.\n—HENRY FORD\nAs a quick recap, I have covered what has changed in SE over the last seven or so years: OSINT and\nhow to use it, communication modeling, pretexting, rapport building, influence, manipulation,\nelicitation, and nonverbals. From a communications stance, this is a great foundation of knowledge,\nbut because I'm a professional social engineer, I need to tell you how to apply this information and\nuse it in an SE context.\nFrom a malicious social engineering angle, there are four main vectors that I see being used in\nattacks: phishing, vishing, SMiShing, and impersonation. There are also combinations of those\nattacks that trap us.\nIn this chapter, I discuss how you can use the skills I discussed in each of these vectors. Then I go\nover (briefly, I promise) the always-fun topic of reporting. And finally, I discuss how to break into\nthe business and close some clients.\nBefore I get into any of that, however, I have to discuss the principles of the pentest. This will set the\nfoundation for how you approach social engineering pentests.\nNOTE\nOne of the things I don't discuss in this chapter is how to use these skills from the\nmalicious side of the fence. This whole book is focused on how to become a\nprofessional social engineer with the goal of “leaving them feeling better for\nhaving met you.” Malicious uses of the skills I've talked about do not leave anyone\nfeeling better for having met you.\nAn Equal Opportunity Victimizer\nThe other thing I want to mention from the beginning is that social engineering vectors are not\nthings that work just on dumb humans. They work on all humans. With the right emotional trigger,\nin the right situation, the right pretext can get any one of us to fall prey.\nI'm often asked if I have ever been maliciously social engineered. Unfortunately, the answer is, yes.\nThe right trigger at the right time made me fall for a phishing email. Fortunately, besides some\nembarrassment, there was no major loss for me, because I knew how to quickly react and what to do\nto fix the problem. I had a M.A.P.P. (which is the topic of Chapter 10, “Do You Have a M.A.P.P.?”).\nI am not a fan of slogans like “There is no patch for human stupidity.” Yes, I acknowledge that there\nare many problems from a security perspective that are results of laziness or even stupidity, but that\ndoesn't mean that only stupid people fall for these things.\nThere was a case where a college professor received a 419 scam phish (which is also known as the\nNigerian prince scam). The professor fell for it 100%. He fell for it so hard that he stole money from\nthe university treasury after he depleted his life savings. Even after he got caught and the FBI was\ninvolved, he accused the agents of trying to take his leads so they could reap the benefits of the\nmillions he was about to see in his accounts.\n164\nNOTE\nA 419 scam, otherwise known as a Nigerian scam, obtained its name from the\narticle of the Nigerian Law (Article 419) that deals with fraud. Nigerian scams\ngenerally start with “I am a prince with millions of dollars …” but lately have\nconverted to being about a widowed woman who needs help. Either way, these\nscams seem to continue to work on people who want to hold on to hope that a\nsmall investment might lead to huge payouts.\nSounds stupid, right? Well, that is an easy answer. Instead, I look at the situation and consider what\ncaused this man to be so invested in the attack. Here are some thoughts to consider:\nHe was having serious money problems, and the scam gave him hope of financial freedom.\nHis feeling of greed was triggered by the massive number he thought he would see transferred to\nhis bank account.\nOnce he committed, he wanted to remain consistent with his decision.\nHe felt he was helping a person in a third-world country to a better life, while also helping\nhimself.\nBy examining the situation from this angle, I could more easily understand how the professor could\nbe so invested in this scam that he ruined his life, committed theft and fraud, and deceived his wife\n—all for the hope, greed, and desire to remain consistent and committed to helping himself and\nanother person.\nI can't tell you how many times a CEO or other high-level person has told me they would never fall\nfor my scams, only to be really angry when they find out they are the source of the remote access\nduring the pentest. Anyone can be a victim of an attack, regardless of their position in an\norganization.\nThe Principles of the Pentest\nPentesting, a shortened form of the term penetration testing, is where a company hires a\nprofessional to try to penetrate the company's network. The end goal is that a pentest should help\nexpose and patch any problems before malicious attackers can use them.\nOver the years, pentesting has become a standard security tool, and many compliance boards\nrequire companies to conduct pentests at least annually. As of right now, there are not many\ngovernment compliance laws that require companies to include social engineering in these tests.\nFor that matter, a company that just wants to check off a box that a test has been done to meet\ncompliance requirements is usually a pretty poor client to have. They are doing it because they are\nmade to do it, not because they want to. Think of it this way: When your kids clean the kitchen\nbecause they want to surprise you, they do a better job than when they are forced to do it as a chore.\nThere are a few written standards regarding pentesting, as well as regulations that can help\npentesters learn some best practices for performing the tests. In 2009, I started to write a\nframework for social engineering, which is now the backbone of www.social-engineer.org. It's\ncalled “The SE Framework,” and many organizations around the globe use it as a standard when\nplanning out services for their annual SE engagements. However, there is still not a clear set of\nstandards for SE pentesting. I think that's mainly because social engineering is so dynamic, it's\nnearly impossible to plan each stage.\nThere are some steps or stages that comprise the normal path of an SE attack vector, which are\nillustrated in Figure 9-1.\n165\nFigure 9-1 The SE stages\nInformation is the lifeblood of the social engineering attack. So, it makes sense that OSINT or\ninformation gathering is always first. You can't really plan attacks until the research is done.\nAfter you gather your OSINT, you can easily determine what pretexts may or may not work.\nKnowing how a company uses social media, communicates, is geographically located, and other\ndetails about their inner workings enables you to develop some good pretext ideas.\nAfter those ideas are developed, you can start planning the attack vectors. Will you send a phishing\nemail? Or will you vish them for more info or credentials? Will you use a mobile-device attack? Will\nyou go in person to the site? Will you combine those vectors? You can answer all these questions as\nyou start to plan out the attacks.\nFrom there, you launch these attacks, collecting the results from all the steps and reporting to the\nclient everything that took place. However, a pentest doesn't always move through strictly linear\nsteps. You may be doing OSINT, come up with a great attack vector, and then want to do more\nOSINT to see if you can find some supporting data.\nNo matter how you approach it, the principles of the SE pentest should include these points:\nDo you want to record phone calls? That is illegal in many states without consent—and don't\nassume that a client hiring you is the same as them giving you “consent” to do as you wish. Do\nyou want to record video of your break-in? Make sure that is signed off as approved.\nDo not just assume that the client should know exactly every step of a social engineering pentest.\nSpell out the services you want to offer so it is clear. This also gives them the option to ask about\neach step of the pentest before you move forward and potentially create a problem.\nMake sure you obtain written permission to record calls you will make.\nMany states are two-party consent, in which case, you will need to obtain the company's consent\nso you don't run into legal issues.\nDetail the exact Google search string or tool that was used so the client can duplicate the steps if\nneeded.\nI have heard some pentesters say they fear they are arming the client to do the pentest\nthemselves. In all the years I've done this, however, there's never been a time that a client did not\nuse my services again because I overeducated them.\nThe story is as important as the results.\nFor example, you might tell the client that there was a 90% click ratio and that 47% of the people\n166\nyou called gave you their domain creds over the phone, which are scary statistics for sure. But\nyou also must explain each step of the process, the way you developed that attack vector, and\nwho shut you down and why—because all those details are important parts of the story for the\nclient.\nDon't live-tweet or post on social media about your successful exploits of your clients. (Seriously,\nwhen I see people do this I cringe.)\nImagine going to your doctor for an invasive test. He probes you in places you'd rather not be\nprobed. It's uncomfortable, maybe even a little painful, and certainly embarrassing. He finishes\nthe test and excuses himself from the office for a minute. You pull your phone out to check some\napps and see a tweet from him that says, “You should see the size of the tumor on this fat slob I\njust had to exam. LOL” He didn't mention your name, and there are no photos of you, but how\ndoes this make you feel? Do you like the doctor? Do you feel as if he is on your side? If I was the\npatient, this would be the last time I would use this doctor.\nApply that to live tweeting about how easy it was to break into a client's place or how bad their\nsecurity is. It's embarrassing and unprofessional.\nThese five principles are good general guidelines to apply to your professional engagements. Before I\nget into rules that can help you with each vector you might use as a pro SE, I have two more\nguidelines: document everything, and be judicious in your choice of pretexts.\nDocument Everything\nThe client is paying you to dig deep, and even if you don't use the OSINT you found in your attacks,\nthe client still needs to know what you discovered. Inevitably, there will be times in your work that\nyou will find truly sensitive material. The question is, how do you handle it?\nIn one test, my company was hired to pentest a high-level executive in a financial institution. During\nour searches, we found photos that she had willingly posed for when she was in her 20s, which were\nnow being used on the photographer's website as promotional material. Sadly, some of those photos\nwere stolen by pornographers and were being used to promote their sites. How do you handle this as\na professional social engineer?\nWe determined that this information was too damaging and embarrassing to use as a theme for a\nspear phish. So we tabled it, performed our pentest, and then requested a special meeting with the\nexecutive in question. We offered to help her get these photos taken down off the websites they were\non and to not report them to her company. She was truly appreciative and to this day remains a\nfriend of mine.\nBe Judicious with Pretexts\nThere have been more times than I can count when I found something truly embarrassing on a\nclient. I personally chose to never use these as the pretext themes. Some of you are probably\nthinking that I'm wasting good opportunities. However, remember my goal is to “leave them feeling\nbetter for having met me.” Also, I want to be able to provide education, which is hard to accomplish\nif I just humiliated someone. Consequently, I'm judicious and sensitive about what I'll choose to use\nin a pretext. With that said, remember that I previously recommended that you always report what\nyou find—so even when you don't use embarrassing information, you should tell the client what you\nfound.\nI had a client who asked my company to do some spear phishing. One of their employees had used\nhis company email to go on a “hook-up” site and post some comments to some very attractive and\nunclothed women, telling them he was coming into town on a business trip and wanted to meet. Put\naside anything you feel about his scruples for offering to cheat on his wife or the security problems\nof using his company email publicly on a site like this. Would a phish from one of these ladies have\nworked? I can almost guarantee it 100%, but we didn't use it. Again, a professional social engineer's\ngoal is to educate and assist rather than humiliate to win.\nPhishing\nPhishing is defined as the act of sending malicious emails that pretend to be from reputable sources.\n167\nThe goals of phishing can be broken down as follows:\nTo deliver malicious payloads that give access to remote attackers\nTo gather credentials\nTo gather other bits of intel for further attacks\nThe goal of the phishing email determines its content, pretext, and delivery method. As a\nprofessional social engineer, you might be asked to send a few different types of phishing methods.\nEducational Phishing\nSometimes, clients don't want to test the network resources of the company—they just want to test\nthe human side. One effective way of doing this is to send an educational phishing email, which\nmeans that when a person interacts with the message, no malicious code is delivered or remote\naccess obtained. It just pings back to a site to report that the phishing message was clicked. The stats\nare used to help a client see how susceptible people are to the attack vector of phishing and where\neducation might be needed.\nWith this type of phishing, the goal is to use curiosity, greed, happiness, or healthy fear to get people\nto click. To do that, you base the pretext on OSINT into a specific target or the whole company. My\nteam and I have sent this type of phishing emails to one person and to hundreds of thousands at one\ntime.\nHere's an example that illustrates why it's important to follow the principles from the previous\nsection: I wrote a phish for a client that looked just like a legitimate LinkedIn invite. I sent it to a\nclient's 7,000 users. It had a very high click ratio—about 73%. I was floating pretty high, and\neveryone, including me, was impressed with the success of this phishing endeavor.\nAnother pentest engagement was coming up, and I was able to reuse my successful LinkedIn Invite\nphish. I sent it out the following week to 10,000 users, and clicks were barely trickling in. When the\ncampaign completed, the click ratio was only about 4%. I couldn't believe it. After all, it was a genius\nphishing method, right? I asked the client to try and find out from their users why this phishing\nattempt had failed so badly.\nIt turns out that the fail was my fault. Company 1 was a manufacturer with employees in the 35-to-\n55 age group. Company 2 was a retailer, and the average age of employees was 19 to 29. When\nCompany 2 asked its employees if they had seen the email and why they didn't click, they replied\nwith comments like, “Yeah, I saw it, but only old people use LinkedIn. I use Facebook.”\n<facepalm> Because I was high from the success with Company 1, I didn't stop to think that it's not\na one-phish-fits-all situation. Each company needs to have a customized phishing message. This\nexperience also solidified my disapproval of phishing Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions that rely\nsolely on templates.\nEven when your purpose for the phishing attempt is educational, it still requires the steps in the\npyramid in Figure 9.1. Starting with OSINT, prepare a phish that appeals to the target audience and\nachieves the desired goal.\nPentest Phishing\nPentest phishing is basically the same as educational phishing except for one big difference: the end\ngoal. Instead of being geared toward education, pentest phishing is aimed at obtaining remote\naccess, credentials, or some other type of compromise.\nPentest phishing generally uses pretexts that involve fear, greed, surprise, or even sadness. I use\nthese emotions because in a phish used on a pentest, I need more than just the click. Often, I need\nthe target to open a document and click past warnings and/or enter credentials. Because these steps\ntake more of the target's time, I need to keep the target in alpha mode for longer, so the emotional\ntriggers need to be stronger.\nOne example of this was a company I pentested that had a very strong love for all things Apple.\nAlmost all of this company's employees used MacBooks and talked about their brand-new iPhones.\nThe pentest took place around the time when a new version of the iPhone was launching. The\nphishing email that I sent to the company's employees had a pretty picture of the new iPhone on it\nand a message that appeared to come from human resources:\n168\n[Name of Company] is going to reward 10 lucky employees with a brand-new iPhone and 1\nyear of your service plan covered 100%. The drawing will take place next Friday at 3:00pm.\nTo enter, all you need to do is go to this intranet page and enter your corporate login and\npassword, and you will be automatically entered: https://iphone.updates-company.com\nGood luck!\nWe bought the domain updates-company.com and created a mock intranet page that had two text\nboxes and a button, as well as the corporate logo. I sent the phishing email to 1,000 people, and\nreceived 750 corporate login credentials.\nThe right emotional trigger at the right time to the right people leads to massive success.\nSpear Phishing\nSpear phishing, and all its variations, is a very personalized form of phishing. After deep OSINT into\nboth the target and any family I can find, I generally will pick something very personal from the list\nto use as my pretext. Many times, the OSINT that I find and use comes from postings that a family\nmember puts on social media.\nIn one case, I found that a target and a group of his friends had gone to Las Vegas for a guys'\nweekend. The large number of photos his friends posted of their escapades that weekend led me to\npick this OSINT as the pretext.\nMy phishing email came from the hotel where he had stayed, and here's what it said:\nMr. [Name of Target],\nOn July 3–8, you stayed at our hotel. Upon checkout, our cleaning staff found an item that\nmight be yours. Can you please check the attached picture and tell us if this item is yours?\nIf the item is yours, please go to this link and fill out the form so we can mail it back to you.\nSincerely,\nHotel Staff\nNow why did I choose to put the link even though I knew that the malware-laden attachment would\nshow no picture? Because there is a chance that the person who received the email will claim the\nitem regardless. The form asked for the following information:\nFull name\nMailing address\nPhone number\nEmail address\nDOB (for proof of being over 18)\nThe last four digits of the credit card that the target used to book his room\nThis pretext was very successful and led not only to a full compromise but a whole lot of additional\nOSINT I used for further attacks.\nEven when I use personal information for a spear phishing pretext, I don't use OSINT that can be\ndamaging to the person. For example, in this same phishing pentest, I would not have used a pretext\nlike this: “We located some pictures of you with a prostitute while you were in Vegas. Click here to\npay a ransom.”—or anything even remotely close to that, even if that was the fact. If I did uncover\nthat type of data in the OSINT, I would report it directly to the target and ask how he or she wanted\nus to handle this matter.\nPhishing Summary\nI don't know about you, but I am averaging more than 200 or 250 emails per day from all my\naccounts. The last time I checked, my job was not to solely check email.\n169\nCRAZY FACT\nAccording to a report by The Radicati Group (www.radicati.com/wp/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2017-2021-Executive-\nSummary.pdf), there was an average of 269 billion emails sent per day during 2017.\nThat is 3.1 million emails sent every second of every day. Another fun fact: I think\nhalf of them come into my inbox (okay, that may be a very slight exaggeration).\nBecause email is the way we do business, communicate globally, keep in touch, send letters, and\neven shop, it is also the vector most widely used for social engineering attacks. As a professional\nsocial engineer, it's necessary for you to learn how to craft professional-looking emails that are\nbased on solid OSINT to truly test your clients' susceptibility to this vector.\nVishing\nIn 2015, the term vishing was entered as a word into the Oxford English Dictionary. I tried to claim\nresponsibility for the popularity of the word, but no one believed me. (I'm partially kidding.)\nVishing is a mash-up of voice phishing, which is phishing over the phone. This vector is much more\ncommon now than it was even just a couple years ago, and my theory is that its popularity is because\nit's such an effective attack.\nHere are a few reasons why I would choose to use vishing for a pentest:\nCredential harvesting\nOSINT\nFull compromise\nI will discuss each of these so you have a clear picture of how they differ.\nCredential Harvesting\nMany times in a pentest, my team and I have technical plans for compromise, but we try vishing or\nphishing to see if we can gain credentials that will give us an easier way in to the network.\nIn one case, after doing OSINT online, I had 10 to 15 numbers that I wanted to try to use for\ncredential harvesting. I developed my pretext based on some other OSINT. I found the target\ncompany was using a third-party outsourced IT company to manage their move from one operating\nsystem to another. It was a massive upgrade, and it involved not just the OS but all the other\nsoftware they relied upon that would need to be updated along with it.\nMy pretext was that I was Paul, from Secure IT (a totally made-up name for this book), and I wanted\nto check on the company's employee upgrade status because we were seeing some problems with\ntraffic from their machines. It went like this:\nTarget: Good morning. This is Steve. How can I help you?\nMe: Hey, Steve. This is Paul from Secure IT. I wanted to …\nTarget: [interrupting]: Oh, you guys! Do you know how much work I have to get done? And your\nnew fancy upgrade is screwing up my life!\nMe: I understand, Steve. That's why I called. We noticed there was a bunch of malformed\npackets coming from your IP address, and I think it might be a DNS poisoning problem\ndue to the stack overflow. [My voice trailed off at the end as I prayed he was\nnontechnical.]\nTarget: My computer is poisoned? What the living hell are you talking about, Paul?\nMe: I'm sorry. I do that—just spout off all the tech jargon. I'm really sorry. What this means is\nthat during the install, there might have been a problem that is causing your slowness. I\ncan walk you through a few steps to see if we can fix it. Do you want to do that?\n170\nTarget: Listen, Paul. I would rather you just send a rep here to fix it—I don't really understand all\nthat stuff you said.\nMe: I get it Steve. I don't have a rep available to send for at least four or five days. But there is\nanother option where I can help you remotely. If you want, I can log in and fix it remotely.\nTarget: Sure, if you can make this machine work again, I'm all for it. What do you need?\nMe: I'm all ready to log in and make the adjustments—I just need to get your username and\nthe password you use to log into your machine.\nTarget: [with no hesitation]: SMaker, and don't forget the capital S and M. My password is a good\none, so don't steal it: Krikie99.\nAnd with that, I had the keys to the kingdom.\nWhen it comes to credential harvesting, I find the job is easier if I can find some OSINT that helps\nme build a believable pretext using details of something relevant and real to the target. Also, in\naddition to vishing for domain credentials, I have vished credentials for VPN, email, secure storage,\nspecific databases, and even door codes.\nVishing for OSINT\nSometimes, during a pentest, I do not have enough details to complete an attack or I want to verify\nsome details before the attack. In one case, I had a spear phish and vishing attack planned for a\ntarget, but we had located several phone numbers and email addresses that could be his.\nWe developed a quick pretext to determine which of the numbers where real. We found that the\ntarget traveled frequently between Canada and London. We located the number for a Hilton Hotel in\nLondon and spoofed as that hotel and then called the numbers we had for the target one by one.\nTarget: Hello?\nMe: Hello, is this Mr. Alfred Gaines?\nTarget: Um, yes. Who is this?\nMe: I'm sorry. This is Paul from the Hilton in London. I wanted to take a minute to thank you\nfor your recent stay with us. We have a short survey about your stay if you have only 30\nseconds… .\nTarget: Stay? What are you talking about? I haven't stayed at a Hilton in London in a few months.\nHow did you get this number?\nMe: Sir, I'm very sorry for the confusion. This is Alfred Gaines phone number 846-555-1212,\nright?\nTarget: Yes, that is correct, but you might have the wrong record for my recent stays.\nMe: Okay, would it be okay if I email you the invoice and you tell me if that is you?\nTarget: Sure you can.\nMe: Excellent. Can I send that to a.gaines@hmail.com?\nTarget: Um, well, I would rather use my other email address. That one is one I don't check often.\nSend it to gainesat@gmail.com.\nMe: Okay, no worries, sir. We will send that right out.\nThis gave us confirmation of the phone number, email address, and a clear vector that the target will\nfall for thanks to this vishing call.\nMy team and I have used this technique many times to verify data we have found and to uncover\nnew pieces of intel. I find this form of vishing very effective because the target is not given much\ntime to decide whether to help. Also, most companies have not properly educated their population\non this vector. That combination creates a big risk for companies.\nVishing for Full Compromise\nIt's possible to perform a full compromise using only vishing. The principles remain the same, and\nwith the right pretext and supporting evidence, a professional SE can easily obtain even the most\nsensitive of details.\n171\nIn one case, my team and I were tasked with testing a large financial institution using vishing as our\nvector. The goal was to call in as C-level employees to see if we could gain access to their usernames\nand passwords or any other part of their systems or data.\nOur pretext was going to be a female executive that was traveling to Hawaii for her honeymoon and\nthat while she was in the airport, her boss called and said he couldn't find the report that was\nessential for the Monday meeting . She knew it was on her desktop but had forgotten the login for\nremote access.\nWe loaded a YouTube clip called “airport background noise” and started the call. I was listening in,\nmuted, as support to provide quick thoughts or ideas as a silent partner. It went like this:\nTarget: Support. How can I help you?\nSE agent: [heavy sigh and stress in her voice]: Can you hear me okay? The noise in this airport is\nso loud.\nTarget: Hi, yes, it is loud, but you are coming in clear. Who am I speaking to today?\nSE agent: Oh my, I am so sorry. [another sigh] This is Jennifer Tilly, SVP of Finance. I'm heading\nto Hawaii for my honeymoon, and my direct called me to say the latest budget report is\nmissing from the directory. He needs it for the Monday meeting, and I need to log in\nand get it to him, but I forgot my login.\nTarget: Okay. Let's see if I can help you. First, I need to verify your identity. But before that, let\nme say congratulations on your marriage, and I hope you have a great time in Hawaii.\nSE agent: Thank you so much. I'm so excited. This is my first time in Hawaii, and I get to go with\nmy best friend and new husband.\nTarget: Bless you. It warms my heart to hear people talk like that. Ms. Tilly, can I get your ID\nnumber, please?\nSE agent: You know what is crazy? Since I was promised no work for two weeks, I didn't bring any\nof my laptops or IDs with me. I can't remember my own birthday half the time, so I\ndon't think I'll remember my ID at all.\nTarget: [trying to be helpful]: Well, maybe if you try. It starts with 17—you only need to\nremember five more digits. [This piece of intel was very important.]\nSE agent: I'm really drawing a blank. I don't know if I'm missing something like 98231?\nTarget: Well, there is a nine and an eight in the number, but, let's try something else. Can you\ntell me your manager's name?\nSE agent: Sure, it's Mike Farely.\nTarget: Okay, great. And can you confirm your email?\nSE agent: j.tilly@companyname.com\nTarget: Perfect. Okay, so here is what I can do, I can reset your password and send it to you on\nyour mobile device; then you can log in and get that report over. Let me just … [sound\nof typing and clicking in the background] Ms. Tilly, I'm sorry, but I do not see that you\nhave remote access installed as of yet. So even if I reset this, you won't be able to get in.\nSE agent: Oh, no. This is just terrible. I'm going to be gone for two weeks, and my flight boards in\njust under 30 minutes. How can we fix this? Please help me! [sounding near tears with\nhigh anxiety in her voice]\nI had just typed a message to the SE agent to suggest to her that we needed to see if we could get the\ntarget to install remote access for us on her machine and give us the one-time code when the\nconversation continued:\nTarget: Well, we can put in a request for remote access to be installed, but that will most likely\ntake a few hours or even until tomorrow.\nSE agent: You have been so kind, and right now, my husband is not too happy. We're supposed to\nbe sitting in the lounge together sharing some champagne, and I am trying to deal with\nthis work issue. Is there a way we can rush this?\nTarget: You know what, Ms. Jennifer? You're going to have an amazing honeymoon; let me see\nwhat I can do. Will you be okay if I put you on hold for a few minutes?\nSE agent: Sure, just not too long. We're supposed to board soon.\n172\nWith that, we could hear the target in the background saying to his coworker: “This poor woman is\nheading to her honeymoon; we need to help get her onto her machine. I'm sure we can do this fast,\nright?”\nWe couldn't really hear the commentary from the other person, but we got the sense that everyone\nwas really rallying to help Jennifer. A few minutes later, the target put the phone on hold to make\nanother call before he came back to the call with the SE agent:\nTarget: Ms. Tilly, well, I have a wedding present for you—an agent is installing remote access\nright now for you. In just 10 more minutes, we should get you on the machine.\nSE agent: You are just the most amazing person I have met! My husband will be so happy, and\nthis is the best present! Thank you!\nTarget: When I get the notice from the agent, I'll text you a one-time code, and then you can get\nin to the access.\nSE agent: Oh, I can't do that. I didn't bring my work phone with me, so I won't be able to check\nthat SMS.\nTarget: Oh, no, Ms. Tilly. We cannot get past this portion. I don't know what to do.\nSE agent: This is just terrible!. This will teach me a lesson for being so dumb. I should have\nbrought my phone. Now I will have to cancel this flight and delay my trip. Well, that is\nsad, but you have been truly amazing and helpful. Thank you so much.\nTarget: No! We will not have you miss your honeymoon; that is not acceptable … [in a very low\nwhisper] Listen, I will send your phone the code; then when it is issued, I will give you\nthe password over the phone, okay?\nSE agent: You would do that for me? I may cry.\nTarget: Now, none of that. We have to get you on that plane not thinking about work at all.\nWith that, we had remote access, a password, and the ability to compromise the whole institution if\nwe wanted.\nPRO TIP\nYou may notice that I tend to go with emotional pretexts that can offer the target\nthe ability to “save” or “help” me. There is a science behind this. Giving someone\nthe ability to trust you while you trust them with that role creates a very strong\nbond between two people. It releases oxytocin, and then that bond makes the\ntarget want to be consistent in their desire to help you, regardless of how insecure\nthat decision might be.\nUsing vishing for full compromise can make the job of the pentester much easier. Many times, it is\nimportant to understand that vishing for compromise may require starting off with OSINT vishing\nbefore moving to more and more detailed pretexts.\nVishing Summary\nVishing is a powerful vector that can be devastating in the wrong hands. Because it can be used for\nalmost every aspect of the social engineering attack, it is a potent weapon.\nFor a professional social engineer, it is imperative to not be afraid of the phone if you want to\nsucceed. Learn to embrace it, even if it is not your favorite method of communication. Having skill\non the phone and learning to build rapport, gain trust, and then elicit information without being\nable to see your target makes you more successful.\nSMiShing\nThis is a short section because SMiShing is not widely used by attackers or professional social\nengineers. In 2017, Wells Fargo was breached, and after that breach, we saw a larger number of\n173\nSMiShing attacks. Many of them looked very much like what you see in Figure 9-2. Most SMiShing\nmessages are simple, but they're effective and generally geared toward loading malware on the\nmobile device or stealing credentials.\nFigure 9-2 A popular SMiShing message after a breach\nOver the last two years, mobile operating systems have been the targets of malware and other\nattacks in the hopes of gaining access to a victim's device. With the move for companies to also allow\nBYOD (Bring Your Own Device), we've seen an increase in mobile device breaches as well. Mobile\nbreaches, which do things like reading emails, remotely turning on the camera or microphone, and\nusing the mobile device as some sort of remote access point, have been the fear of many\norganizations.\nFor that reason, it is important for a social engineer to understand how to use SMiShing in their\npractice. Here are a few rules that make SMiShing much different from phishing:\nBrevity is key. A SMiSh needs to be short and sweet—no build up, no opener and closer, just\nthe facts and a link.\nLinks. In my opinion, it is always better to have a domain that looks similar to the attack you\nare launching, but if that is not possible, then shortened URLs are way more acceptable in an\nSMS than in an email. Hovering to check a link is nearly impossible on a mobile device, so the\nuser needs to have advanced training to see bad links.\nDon't skimp. If you are trying for credential harvesting, don't think that you don't need\nbranding or the web page to look legit because the target is using a mobile device. To ensure you\nare fully testing targets, make sure to spend the time to make everything look real.\nDon't make it too many steps. The target is on a mobile device, so if there are three or more\nsteps, you'll lose your audience, and they'll not be motivated to continue.\nAs we see the increase of BYOD and home-based employees, it will become even more important for\nthe professional social engineer to understand this vector and how to test a population with it.\nMobile phones are here to stay, and they're getting more and more robusy and integrated as part of\nour mobile work life. This will make it even harder for our clients to detect attacks.\nImpersonation\nImpersonation is one of the most dangerous vectors, but it's also one of the riskiest for SE agents to\nemploy. Therefore, it's the least used vector out of the four. Impersonation is the physical\nimpersonation of an employee of the target company or someone in authority who can be trusted\n(law enforcement, utility worker, and so on).\nFor myself and my team, impersonation is the most fun vector to help clients with, but the risk is\nquite low for us. With an actual attack, there is quite a large risk to impersonation, and that means it\nrequires the most planning. In our pentests, we have a “get out of jail free letter,” which means we\ncan't really get in trouble for our exploits, whereas the real bad guys, if caught, spend lots of time in\nprison.\n174\nIMPERSONATION SE VECTORS VS. RED TEAMING\nA red team generally goes in at night (although it can be at any time) and focuses\non trying to breach the physical security—elevators, locks, security cameras, and\nso on. An impersonation SE vector focuses on the people part of physical security.\nSo, instead of picking a lock, we are convincing the person with the keys to let us\nin. Instead of shimming that door, we are getting someone with the badge to let us\nthrough. A red team focuses on the security hardware, while impersonation from\nSE focuses on the people.\nPlanning an Impersonation Pentest\nA social engineering pentester needs to keep in mind that all senses of the target are engaged when\nit comes to the impersonation vector. Whereas phishing engages only sight and vishing involves just\nhearing, impersonation needs to address almost all the senses (although it might not involve taste\ntoo much).\nFor that reason, it's important to thoroughly plan the principles of the pentest, as described in the\nfollowing subsections.\nInfo Gathering\nInformation gathering is an important part of a physical onsite impersonation assessment. I often\nask students to give me a pretext that will guarantee entry. Think about this for a second. Do you\nhave an idea?\nStudents often suggest something like UPS delivery. My follow-up questions help them think\nthrough their initial statement: “Okay, great—but then what? How many of you have seen a UPS\ndelivery guy roaming the building? They don't usually get past the front desk or the mailroom.”\nOSINT is essential for developing a plausible pretext for impersonation. On one of my jobs, I found\nout that local construction was causing spiders that normally come out in spring to come out a bit\nearly. It was so bothersome, it made the local news. My pretext was spraying for the spider\ninfestation, and it worked amazingly well.\nPretext Development\nI touch on pretext development when I talked about gathering information, but don't make the\nmistake of trying to plan your pretext before you do the OSINT. Also, after you pick your pretext,\nyou need to consider some other things: clothing, tools, your look, and so on. In addition, consider\nwhether the props should look new or used. You have to think about all the things that make the\npretext believable. Cover your bases.\nRecently, I was breaking into a couple of banks with one of my employees, and I had learned by\ndoing OSINT that the bank had just completed a PCI compliance test. We found the name of the\ncompany that had done the test, so we came fully dressed, badged, and carded up as the PCI\ncompliance company. This got us right into the ATM testing center with no problems. From there,\nwe were into two different computers, even obtaining the credentials of other employees in the cube.\nWhen a manager approached and asked who our internal contact was, we didn't have a name. That\nwas an oversight on my part, and it was a fail that led to us being caught. Yes, you can argue that by\nthis time, we had compromised the network and had close to 30 minutes in the ATM testing center\nwith access to multiple computers, but that one piece of data would have saved us and given us more\ntime.\nAttack Planning and Performing\nOnce you have the pretext, you need to understand what the goals are when you get into the\nbuilding. Another way of saying that is you need to know what you cannot do. Are you allowed to get\na remote shell? Are you allowed to compromise a server? Are you allowed to take a device from the\n175\nbuilding? Don't make the terrible assumption that just because you were hired to play a bad guy, you\nhave free rein to do whatever they would do. That would be a pretty bad assumption.\nPlan out what the attack should look like from start to finish, and then make sure you have the tools\non hand and tested to accomplish those goals.\nOnce the plan is complete, make sure that your GOOJFL (“get out of jail free” letter) covers all that\nyou want to do, and if it doesn't cover everything, get it included.\nPerfect practices make perfect.\nReporting\nRemember, the most important part of an engagement is telling the client what you did, how and\nwhat needs to be done next. Before you even start, make sure you have permission to record audio\nand video. Or if you don't have this permission, figure out how you will ensure that you capture the\nfull story for the report.\nFor me, it is important to tell a story with this kind of attack. I want the client to feel like they can\nsee, hear, and feel the full attack and get a sense for what worked and what didn't. I find it very\nbeneficial to be overflowing with praise for their successes and matter-of-fact for mine.\nMy goal in the report is to “leave then feeling better for having” read it. To do that, I can't be\nembarrassing or overly flamboyant or at all derogatory.\nThe principles stated here thus far will help you with your physical onsite engagements. I find that a\nlot more planning needs to go into this part of the job. Still, there may be some more questions on\nthe information to include in a report. The following are my thoughts on the handling of some\nsensitive data.\nThe Legality of Recording\nRemember, I am not a lawyer, and nothing I say should be construed as legal advice. You should\ndefinitely have a lawyer to run these things by.\nFor my company's engagements, we do the following:\nResearch the state and/or country laws for audio and video recording before the job.\nGet permission in writing from the client to record both.\nNever, ever, ever, ever, ever (did I say never ever?) use these recordings in a speech or training\nwithout permission.\nAnd even if you get permission, you should sanitize the recordings so there is nothing\nidentifiable. By “sanitize,” I mean take out all names, workplaces, and any other identifying\nwords.\nMake sure all recordings go to the client for their education.\nEnsure that storage, transportation, and usage are always secure.\nIt is important to understand the risks of what you are doing and know also how you plan to use\nwhat you collect. In one job I asked a woman to enter her user ID and password in a nearby\ncomputer. As she was complying with my request I not only recorded her face but captured her\ncredentials on camera. To save her embarrassment, I blurred out her face from the video. Of course,\nthe client could have told me that they wanted the unblurred video—it's their choice and right to do\nthat. But I presented the blurred video first, and the client didn't argue. If the video is used for\neducational purposes, I will not feel like the woman has to relive her embarrassment forever.\nConsiderations of Sanitization\nWhile on a job, I was recording everything using my pinhole camera that was hidden in a clipboard.\nI slipped into a server closet as I was trying to evade security, and I stumbled upon two people\nengaged in … well … not something you would think they would be doing at work. (Yes, sex, if you\ndidn't guess it yet.) Stumbling on that made me forget I was supposed to be an SE for a second. The\ncouple in the closet got mad and yelled at me, and I ran out. Later, I realized that I had almost 60\nseconds of a sex tape filmed thanks to their lack of professionalism. This is obviously not something\nI could send in to the client, and I had to think about how I wanted to handle this.\n176\nEventually I decided that the company had paid me a pretty penny to help secure them, their\nnetwork, and their people. What I witnessed was a breach of company policy and, for all I knew,\ncould have been a honeypot. How liable would I be if I did not report it and then heard the company\nhad been breached and I could have stopped it?\nPRO TIP\nIn the world of espionage, a honeypot is a person who goes undercover to seduce\nanother person into giving up sensitive information. It has also been used to\ndescribe a system (computer) that is set up to collect details from unsuspecting\nusers.\nI decided it was my obligation to report this incident. And, yes, it did result in the gentleman being\nfired. Why wasn't the woman fired? Well, she didn't work for the company—the guy had brought in\nsomeone from the outside to a server closet to partake in activities that should have been saved for\nthe privacy of home, a hotel, or anywhere but a work environment.\nYou must decide what part of what you record you will sanitize. I sanitize when someone has taken\nan action that is not illegal—If they just fell for the social engineering attack, but they weren't\nmalicious toward company rules. My focus is always trying to ensure that education is the first step\nrather than firing.\nHowever, if I find someone downloading pornography, engaged in sexual activity, stealing, accessing\ndata they shouldn't, or heaven forbid, engaging in any form of child exploitation, they shouldn't\nexpect any kindness from a professional social engineer who's trying to protect his or her clients.\nEquipment Procurement\nThere are lots of places where you can find “spygear.” From Amazon to specialty shops (one of my\nfavorites is online at https://spyassociates.com), there are many locations to get this type of gear.\nKeep in mind that you get what you pay for. The $25 pen cam will be poor quality and shaky,\nwhereas the $600 button cam with DVR recording capability will most likely be a lot better.\nDo a little research before you make a purchase. I always do the following before I place an order:\nI check the return policy and ensure I don't have to ship the item to a foreign country if it breaks.\nI read reviews of both the product and the company to ensure I am getting the best bang for my\nbuck.\nNOTE\nIt might take you some time to get comfortable enough to worry about filming\nangles while also being a good social engineer. For that reason, I try to have a\ncouple cameras going at one time, so I get at least one good angle.\nImpersonation Summary\nWith the right planning, the execution of this complex vector can be made much easier. Remember\nthat impersonation is different from red teaming, and you need to do good solid planning to make\nsure you test the physical security protocols thoroughly.\nIt's important for you as the SE pentester to understand the scope of what you're doing so you can\nhit all the goals the client wants. Especially since the end goal is to include a section of the report\nthat outlines how to fix the problems found. That section will be more useful if you, as the SE,\nunderstand not just the what (you did) but also the why (it worked).\nWe are seeing more and more breaches involving the physical side of security—USB drops, physical\n177\ntheft of devices, and even worse, violence in the workplace. For these reasons, it is essential for a\nprofessional SE pentester to have mastered the impersonation SE vector as part of their practice.\nReporting\nEarly in my career, I was hired to break into seven warehouses. I had a 100% success ratio. I was\neven able to get into one warehouse twice in the same day by using different pretexts.\nIt was a great feeling, and I had the whole thing recorded and ready for the client. The project lead\ntold me to start writing the report and sent me a template document. The template document was\nblank with the exception of some headers.\nI think I stared at it for hours—starting, then stopping, then erasing, and then starting again. After\ndozens of hours, I had completed what I felt to be a masterpiece of reporting history.\nI envisioned that the reporting team would receive it, read it, and throw palm leaves in the streets\nfor me as I entered the building. I sent it in and waited for the glowing praise.\nA day later, the phone rang, and the call went something like this (I've tried to make it more family\nfriendly):\n“Hey Chris, what is the steaming pile of garbage you sent to my inbox? Is this a joke? Is this some\nkind of laugh you are having? Do you think this would ever pass as a report? It's coming back\nwith redlining for repairs. Get it done now!”\nWhen I got the report back, it was no longer black and white—it was red, green, and white. It\nseemed as if there was not one paragraph that didn't have major edits.\nIt took me two weeks to fix the document, and it was the worst experience in my reporting career.\nHowever, at the same time, it was the best experience I've ever had. It taught me what a good report\nlooks like and feels like. My initial report contained a storyline that made me look amazing and cool\n—like James Bond on steroids. However, it was missing some key elements that might be helpful for\nthe client.\nThis part of the chapter isn't a seminar in report writing, but I have some principles to share with\nyou.\nProfessionalism\nProfessionalism is the art of being a professional. Think about going to your doctor, someone who\nyou hope and pray is professional. How would you feel if you stepped on the scale, and he said,\n“Whoa Nelly! Anyone got a fish for this whale?” before patting you on the back and saying that he\nwas “just kidding.”\nI can't imagine many of us would enjoy that. Similarly, our clients don't want to hear things like,\n“We pwned you so bad!” or “Wow, did this guy actually put this on the web?” or “All your warehouse\nbelongs to us.” (I might know something about that last one from experience.)\nRemember that this report will be read by many people, and the best environment for change is one\nin which people feel happy rather than embarrassed or humiliated. Your language, descriptors, and\nthe way you relay facts should all exhibit professionalism.\nGrammar and Spelling\nGrammar and spelling are a personal pet peeve of mine. It is attack vector, not attach vector. It is\nrapport, not report. You get the point. You should always factor in the time to run a spell-check on\nyour report and then have a trusted person proofread it.\nEven with those checks, you still might leave a few errors behind. Mistakes happen. Don't expect\nperfection, but don't send in a report that has so many errors, you leave the client thinking that you\njust didn't care about this piece of the work.\nAll the Details\nI have heard pentesters in the past say they leave out certain details—such as how they found\nOSINT, the exact Google search string they used, or some other artifact—because they feel if they\n178\ngive the client too much information, the client won't need the social engineering services anymore.\nTo me, that is just plain silly. I heard the same argument when I wrote my book, Phishing Dark\nWaters, in which I outlined the exact methodology and process for making a phishing program.\nHowever, the reverse occurred: Many companies are using that book to build an amazing phishing\nawareness program, as well as many who read it and wanted my help in setting up the program for\nthem.\nDon't get too worried about giving your clients too much. Most of them will appreciate your\nknowledge and be impressed by your finds. They'll want to stick with someone confident enough to\ngive them all those details.\nWith that said, if you find super-sensitive items, be sure to communicate with your point of contact\nto clarify what should and should not be included the report.\nMitigation\nMitigation is maybe the most important part of the report, but it's also the most overlooked. Do you\nwant your doctor to tell you that you have a terrible disease, then wish you “good luck” and leave the\nroom; or say, “See you next physical … I hope.”? Of course not. You shouldn't do this to your clients,\neither. Instead, give them some mitigation that's actionable.\nIf the mitigation steps are what I call platitudes and nonsense, what does it mean to your clients?\nFor example, let's say you've done a vishing test for a client and achieved an 80% compromise ratio\nfor the month. Which of the follow mitigations options do you think will help the client more?\nOption 1:\nSocial-Engineer recommends that you continue testing your population and using positive\nreinforcement to elicit the proper responses to vishing attacks.\nOption 2:\nSocial-Engineer analyzed the data from this month's vishing campaign and noticed the\nfollowing two points that could be used in further education:\nFemale callers tended to do better using the same pretexts as male callers. This may point to\nmore education being needed on how to recognize elicitation.\nWhen presented with a fake employee name, only 12% of your population tried to verify the\nname, and there were even a few who continued to give information after not finding the\nname. This demonstrates the need for more education on how to properly verify a caller.\nSocial-Engineer would like to schedule a call to discuss how these can be implemented into an\neducational program as we continue testing.\nObviously the second option is the best, but too many times (and I admit my team has been guilty of\nit too), reports include non-actionable statements that really don't help the client and act as filler.\nEven after doing this for years, it is a constant battle to make sure complacency doesn't set in, and I\nam giving 100% effort on this point for my clients.\nNext Steps\nIn addition to mitigation (fixing the problem) clients often want to know, “Now what?” Including\nnext steps is an essential ending to the report. It allows the client to know what they should do and\nexpect moving forward.\nI don't mean you should simply state, “See you next pentest.” You need to follow the same rules of\nmitigation as I previously discussed. Give your clients enough detail to feel armed with a clear path\nto progress.\nMany of my clients are monthly service clients, so the path forward is already known, but that\ndoesn't mean I can rely on that solely. The client will still want to know if we should alter things or\nadapt to enhance the program.\nWhen you put all these steps together, you will have amazing reports that will truly help your clients\nand leave them and you feeling better.\n179\nTop Questions for the SE Pentester\nAs I conclude this chapter, I want to cover some of the most commonly asked questions I get as a\nprofessional SE pentester. I'm sure there are tons of other questions, but these are the most\ncommon. I hope these will help you whether you are presently in SE as a career or working toward\nmaking it a career.\nHow Can I Get a Job Being a Social Engineer?\nThis may be the most asked question of my whole career. After you've decided you're going to go for\nit, what do you do? Well, you have to start somewhere, and this is why this answer is so hard. Maybe\nyou have been working at your current career for the last 10 years. You have expertise and skill in\nthat area, and you have the pay to match. Starting a new career as a social engineer means not only\nstarting over in expertise and skill, but maybe in pay as well. My best advice is that you be willing to\ndo the following:\nStep out of your comfort zone.\nStart over.\nLearn whole new skill sets.\nTake a pay cut if necessary.\nIf you can do these things, you can expect a nice career in social engineering. But (there is always a\nbut, isn't there?) you can't just expect that SE companies will be calling you to offer you a job. There\nare only a handful of us social engineers out there, and you still have to prove yourself different from\nall other candidates. These things will take some work on your part.\nNOTE\nRemember that being a professional social engineer is not all about breaking into\nbanks and getting shells through phishing. There is a lot of office work and\nreporting that needs to take place. Being a professional social engineer is not just\nabout being able to talk to others or being able to think quickly and clearly under\npressure—it's about the whole package.\nWhere are your weaknesses from this list:\nElicitation\nSmooth talker\nQuick thinker\nGood report writer\nProfessional speech\nYou need to identify them, so you can then improve upon them.\nIf you get the chance, go to https://youtu.be/RGnzf66-a4A to watch a speech I gave\nat DerbyCon7 about this topic. (Warning: It begins with a prank that my friend\nDave Kennedy pulled on me, but hang in there—I get back on topic soon after.)\nHow Do I Get My Clients to Do SE Stuff?\nLet's say you are already a pentester and doing some social engineering work, this section gives you\nsome ideas about how to get your existing clients to hire you for more SE gigs.\nDon't Offer Them Some of the Services for Free\nSome people have suggested that if you give clients some free services, those clients will see the\nbenefit of what you do and pay you for more work. I have an anecdote that explains why this tactic\n180\ndoesn't work the way you expect it to.\nWhen I started in the tech industry and was building computers, I tried launching a free seminar on\nhow to stay safe as a small business. In this seminar, I provided more than 60 minutes of real\nactionable tips on antivirus, networking, file sharing, and more. At the end, there was a 5-minute\nsales pitch on why companies needed to use me as their provider for all this.\nI partnered with a local chamber of commerce and offered the speech for free. We set up three of\nthese of seminars, and the number of people signing up was huge. I was getting 20, 30, or more\npeople signed up for each seminar. I was already seeing dollar signs and feeling like I won.\nThe day of the first seminar rolled around, and I went to the room, set up my projector, and laid out\nmy handouts and all the give-aways I had paid for out of pocket. Five minutes before the start time,\nthere was only one person in the room. At two minutes before start time, there was still only one\nperson in the room. The starting time arrived, and no one else had shown up. It was quite awkward.\nI started giving my speech to the one person. After five minutes, he said, “Hey, this is really weird.\nDo you want to just go get lunch and talk?”\nI was lost—I couldn't figure out what happened. After the same thing happened on the second\nseminar I just canceled the third. Someone suggested, “Hey, next seminar charge people $50 per\nhead to sign up. Tell them they will get more than $50 worth of stuff free but make them pay.”\nI was very reluctant to even try. I thought that if they hadn't come for free, there was no way they'd\npay to attend. However, when I charged for the seminar, I had 10 people sitting in the room, and\neach had paid $50.\nWHAT??? It didn't matter that the attending numbers were smaller than my original sign-up\nnumbers. What did matter was that the 10 that came, actually paid for the privilege to come.\nLater, I sat with the business friend who'd suggested that I charge for the seminar, and he explained\nthat when people pay, even a small amount, they add a value to it. If someone signed up and paid\nbut didn't end up attending, they would be out the nonrefundable $50. That became a powerful\nincentive to attend.\nWhen I was just starting my SE career, it was as if I had not learned anything about offering things\nfor free. I was getting offers to give speeches all over the globe, and I was charging them nothing. I\nfound that many times, people would cancel or not commit until the very last minute.\nA friend of mine, Ping Look, told me to stop charging nothing and to start charging a fixed amount. I\nwas very reluctant to listen to her, but I reflected on my previous experience and decided to try it.\nAmazingly enough, people were more than willing to pay the higher amount. They also seemed to\nvalue me more. This changed the way I did business, and from that point on, I didn't ever give things\naway for free.\nThe moral of this long story is this: Don't think that giving away your talents for free will make\npeople value you. It won't work. You can find the balance of offering a high-end service with some\ndiscounts or offering a three-month contract with one month free. It's okay to get creative about\nwhat you charge, but know that working for free just devalues your expertise.\nFail Fast and Move On\nIf I meet a potential client who is reluctant to engage my services, I offer to begin with one spear-\nphish on a corporate-level person in the company to demonstrate how effective it can be. Usually\nwhen that decision-maker sees the danger and benefit, they are ready to put a budget forward for\nthese types of services. One small engagement is often all it takes to lead to more engagements with\na company. But sometimes that is not enough, and a company doesn't want to engage in further\nsocial engineering services.\nIf nothing you do is working to convince a company that you can help, what should you do? Walk\naway. Realize that it is better to fail fast and walk way than to try to make a square peg fit in a round\nhole.\nIf a company cannot see the need to have SE as part of their security regimen, then you probably\ndon't want them as a client. They will be frustrating to work with and eventually will not find value\nin you.\nI had a client that was with me for four years. When I first started with this company, they were\nalmost the perfect client. I had an amazing point of contact, and that person was raring to go. The\n181\nprogram was so successful that the client saw massive changes. The woman who was our internal\ncontact running the program was offered a job by a much larger company that wanted her to run its\nsecurity program. She jumped at the chance, and I understood why. A new woman was hired to take\nher place.\nFrom the first day working with the new woman, it wasn't the same. The new point of contact was\neasily offended, took this way too personal, was not willing to take the risks, and didn't want to take\nthe program to the depth her predecessor did. Consequently, the program floundered. People\nreverted to their old ways, and although the phishing statistics still looked great on paper, the\nprogram was stagnant.\nSix months before I parted ways with the company, I had told my team we would lose them as a\nclient, and we sure did. They are only the second client we have ever lost this way, but I think it was\nfor the best. They didn't want to take the program in the direction it needed to go, so it was\nfrustrating for them and for us.\nWith only a set number of hours in a day and clients we can handle, I would rather spend it with\nclients that want to see the change. Don't be afraid to walk away from deals because they aren't the\nright fit.\nHow Much Should I Charge?\nI often hear this question, but it's something that I considered not even putting in this book because\nthe answer isn't easy or simple. However, since it's such a popular FAQ, I try to cover this topic as\nbest as I can.\nFirst, you need to understand what hourly rate you can charge as a consultant. I did a little research\nand found several sites that give suggestions for what rates are acceptable for consultants in the\nsecurity field for different areas around the globe.\nThe rate depends on a several factors, such as years of experience, expertise in the field, how well-\nknown your company is, and what services you offer.\nFor the sake of easy calculation, say I decide my rate should be $100 USD per hour. I work out my\nfees by deciding (based on experience) that phishing 1,000 emails per month is going to take me 20\nhours per month. I spend three hours on OSINT and seven hours on reporting, which means I will\ninvest a total of 30 hours per month. My rate calculation will look like this:\nThis is not a hard-and-fast rule—it's just a method I use to gauge my price. I may alter the rate based\non things like\nThe size of the company\nMulti-year contracts\nHow I feel about the client (very subjective)\nThe point is, the preceding calculation can help get you close to figuring out your rate, but it might\nnot be exact. At least it gives you some guidance on how to start charging for your services.\nNOTE\nThese are just a few of the questions I get asked often. There are many others—too\nmany to put into one book. I promise if you email me through the website\nwww.social-engineer.com/contact-us/, I'll do my best to answer you or help you\nfind an answer.\nSummary\nI read a report that said only a minority of the companies in the United States actively provide\n182\ntraining on phishing awareness through monthly campaigns.\nIf only a small percentage of U.S. companies are providing training, and my company grew by 300%\nin the last three years, what will happen when 20%, 30%, or 50% of U.S. companies start actively\ntraining?\nThe fact is, there is a huge need for professional, quality social engineering pentest professionals. I\ncannot do all the work myself, so I might as well help as many people as I can get in the space to give\nthe best quality services they can to all the companies that need it.\nI don't think there will be a time when humans are no longer in the workforce. Consequently, human\nvulnerability will always exist. In addition, people have to deal with a never-ending barrage of\nattacks on their empathy centers, fear centers, and logic centers. These attacks can wear us down\nand can cause us to make bad decisions.\nWe will always need SE professionals to help companies learn how to stay secure against these\nattacks. I think there will be a huge increase in artificial intelligence and technology that helps\ncombat these attacks, but there will never be a time when we do not need humans to help other\nhumans.\nMaybe you are reading this book because you want to break into the social engineering business. Or\nmaybe you are reading this book as an existing professional looking for new tips and tricks. Or there\ncan be a number of other reasons that you may have picked this book up. For any of those reasons\nyou want to really focus on the next chapter that will help you prepare a M.A.P.P. .\n183\n10\nDo You Have a M.A.P.P.?\nI'm a very big believer in controlling what you can, forgetting what you can't, and not wasting\nmental energy on things that don't deserve it.\n—JOSH CITRON\nI feel a book that is focused on creating professional social engineers would not really be complete\nwithout this chapter. You can blend all the attacks, the psychology, the physiology, and the report-\nwriting to achieve something, but without a M.A.P.P., a giant piece of the puzzle is missing. What is\na M.A.P.P.? It stands for Mitigation and Prevention Plan.\nWhy do you need a mitigation and prevention plan? How do you help your company or your clients\ndevelop one? What can you mitigate and plan about social engineering attacks? I answer these\nquestions in this chapter.\nWhen I started gaining momentum with my clients, I realized something important. My goal needed\nto be something really odd: to be so good that I would eventually work myself out of a job. Yeah, you\nread that right. I needed to help my clients learn how to defend against SE attacks to the point that\nthey eventually would not need me.\nYou know those pentesting companies that advertise that they always have a 100% success ratio?\nWell, how demoralizing is it for a customer to be writing you the check knowing they will never get\nbetter. Or that no matter how good they get, the social engineer still will always win? The message in\nthat is there's no hope. Nothing they do will ever block all the holes in their security. Eventually you\nmight be able to understand why customers say, “Why bother trying to protect ourselves?”\nIn my epiphany, I decided that I had to help my customers plan how they would mitigate attacks\nand how they would get so good at catching these attacks that eventually all they would need is\nmaintenance. If you are a professional social engineer like me, then you need this chapter to be\nsuccessful. If you are a company, this chapter will help you plan your M.A.P.P.\nThis hit home with me when I realized I needed to change my health. I had tried a bunch of things\non my own, which failed miserably. In the community of white-hat hackers, I had seen a few who'd\nmade some serious health changes. I spoke to one and asked how he did it, and he put me in touch\nwith a man named Josh Citron.\nJosh wanted to do a video chat for our first conversation. I really didn't want to—I imagined that he\nwas in super shape, and the last thing I wanted to do was video chat with my fat-self on camera with\nhim. To make matters worse, I looked him up on the Internet, and it was not too hard to find some\npictures of him. He is some sort of beast-man-chimera that can lift small vehicles and still run six\nmiles.\nNow, imagine that if in my first meeting with Josh, his opening words were: “Okay, Chris. Here's the\ndeal. If you do everything I say, and if you listen to every word and never cheat and keep paying me\n… well, you'll never win. You'll stay fat and probably won't get stronger—ever. So, let's get started!” I\nprobably would have looked at Josh like he was nuts! Or if he had scornfully looked at me on that\nvideo chat and treated me poorly because all he saw was a fat slob, I most likely would have not\ncontinued with him.\nHowever, Josh told me that if I did everything he said, I would see gradual changes, and when I hit\nmy goals, we would move to a maintenance-only program. Because he also treated me with dignity\nand respect, I was ready to rock and roll.\nJosh helped me make a M.A.P.P. that would mitigate risk of bad habits and build new and better\nhabits. It wasn't some radical diet of cutting out anything that tastes like food and eating only salads\nand sadness. I made habit changes, enhanced my decision-making, and gained knowledge to make\nthe best possible decision in all situations.\nThat process can be applied directly to developing a social engineering and security M.A.P.P. I've\ndeveloped four steps that, when followed, will create this M.A.P.P. and all the benefits that come\nwith it:\n184\nStep 1: Learn to Identify Social Engineering Attacks\nStep 2: Develop Actionable and Realistic Policies\nStep 3: Perform Regular Real-World Checkups\nStep 4: Implement Applicable Security-Awareness Programs\nHere is what I promise: If you follow these steps, you will see the change you want in your\npopulation. It won't happen overnight—in fact, depending on things like turnover, corporate culture,\nand so on, it can take a few years or more—but it does work.\nAre you ready to get started?\nStep 1: Learn to Identify Social Engineering Attacks\nWhen I was younger, I wanted to learn how to fight, so I took a martial art. I remember the first day\nI met my trainer. As a test, he asked me to block the punches he threw at me. It seemed to me that,\nout of thin air, he created fists aimed at every part of my head and body. I was unable to block a\nsingle hit.\nFortunately, he wasn't actually punching me—he was giving me light taps, but he landed every single\none. Jump forward one year: I had become successful at blocking a large majority of all the hits\ncoming my way. What had changed is that I had learned to identify what an attack looked like and\nfelt like, so I was able to not only identify but learn how to react to it.\nStep 1 seems self-explanatory, but it is not. How many people in your company do you think can\ndefine phishing, vishing, SMiShing, and impersonation attacks? How many people do you think\nrealize how dangerous the name of your dumpster vendor can be in the hands of an attacker? How\nmany people in your employee population do you think know what malware, ransomware, and\nTrojans are?\nDon't get me wrong: I'm not saying that every employee needs to be a social engineering Bruce Lee,\nbut each person needs to at least understand what the fight may entail. This first step of\nunderstanding what attacks are, what they might look like, and what they can do to you is vital.\nYou might be sitting there asking, “But how do we do that?” That's a great question. Imagine if I had\nwalked into that dojo, and the trainer had said this to me: “Okay, you want to learn to fight? Get on\nthe mats with this fifth-degree expert who has been fighting for 20 years and go at it.” I would have\nrun out of the dojo. And if he just put me in front of a computer for 20 minutes and showed me a\nCBT (computer-based training video) on martial arts and then put me in the ring, I would have had\na similar response. (Put down the pitchforks. I'm not saying that computer-based training is totally\nuseless, but relying on it as the main portion of your program is a mistake. CBTs have a specific role,\nwhich I talk about later in this chapter.)\nWhat I received from my trainer—and what you should expect from a social engineering expert—was\nto be taught how to recognize and take a “hit,” in the form of a social engineering. I was given the\nproper training on stance and body position, and then I was put on the heavy bag and the light bag.\nWhen the trainer felt I was ready, I sparred with a person who didn't want to kill me; he wanted to\nhelp me learn.\nThis first step of learning how to identify and know that these attacks exist will put your team light-\nyears ahead of the average person. Help your employee population to understand the value of the\ninformation they possess—that emails can be used to breach the whole company; that phone calls\nare used to get passwords and other sensitive details; that if their mobile device is breached, it can\nbe used to attack their home and work networks; and that just because a person is smiling and\nfriendly, you can't ignore the badge policy.\nHelping your employee population understand the possible attacks can enlighten them enough to\nmake them more aware. Because I do this day in and day out, I sometimes forget that not everyone\nknows these attacks exist.\nI was sitting with a friend who was telling me how his grandma gave over a large sum of money\nthrough MoneyGram because someone had called claiming to be her grandson and needed bail\nmoney. I said, “Oh, no. She got hit by the grandma scam!”\nHe asked, “The what?”\n185\nI explained how this type of attack is sadly all too common. His reaction was one of anger, and he\nsaid, “If you knew these things existed, why didn't you warn your friends?”\nWow, he was right. I had just assumed that everyone read about these things, but they don't. Would\nmy warning have saved them? Maybe not, but the lesson is still there.\nThink back to my experience with health and fitness coach Josh, the trainer. After that initial video-\nchat meeting, I had to send him my daily log every week for a while, and there had been days of\nfailure. Do you know what Josh never did? He never scolded me like a child, never guilted me, never\ngave up on me. Instead he'd say, “Okay, let's do better this week.”\nApply that and learn from it. Don't assume that the knowledge about these attacks is just common\nsense. When someone doesn't have the knowledge, it doesn't mean they're just stupid, lame, and\ndeserve to fail. Instead, have empathy and think: “Okay, we can do better next time. How can we do\nthat?” That will really help you make the next step more successful.\nStep 2: Develop Actionable and Realistic Policies\nOne of the things Josh started me off with is learning what a real portion of food looked like. He\nwould tell me how much protein, carbs, and fat I should consume in a day and leave it up to me to\nmake the decisions. So, I could consume it all in one meal, but I would have been really hungry later.\nJosh also taught me not to rely on my eyes. He once told me to put on a plate what I thought were\nthe right amounts of several foods. Then I was to weigh it. WHOA, it was way more than I would\nhave ever guessed. This rule, or “policy,” helped me to learn a valuable lesson about changing my\ndecision-making habits.\nIn the security world, policy may seem like a bad word. Most people hate making policies, enforcing\nthem, and/or having to follow them. I have found that policies often get a bad rap because they don't\nmake sense or are not clear in their intent. Other times, policies are so restrictive that they seem to\ncreate an adversarial relationship with the population.\nFinding a balance is not an easy thing to do, but it is essential to succeed in creating a secure\nenvironment that is filled with a security-awareness culture.\nWhat makes a good policy—one that is not too restrictive and yet actionable and realistic? There are\na few aspects to a good policy that will help you in building solid rules for improvement.\nTake the Thinking out of the Policy\nToo many times policies are so broad and general that they can leave way too much thinking, or\ndecision-making, in the hands of a person who has not yet been educated on what these attacks are.\nNow, I'm not saying you should treat your people like they're dumb. Just know that the less time the\nemployee must spend thinking about something, the better. Simple is best.\nHere's an example: My company did some vishing work for a large financial institution, and more\nthan 80% of the time, we were successful in getting very personal details on the targets. We played\non their empathy and trust and exploited those things.\nTo this company's credit, they had really nice employees working for them, and we didn't want that\nto change. How terrible would it be if the mitigation advice was, “Make your employees more\nparanoid and untrusting”? What this company did was astounding. They made a real, actionable\npolicy: “You are not allowed to give any information out to unauthenticated users.”\nAnd they didn't stop there. They defined both what is valued information and how to authenticate\nusers properly. Then they did one more thing that made a huge difference: They disabled the\nemployees' ability to move past this first stage if the questions were not answered properly. For\nexample:\nAttacker: Hi. This is Joe Smith. I need my account info. I have my account number, but I forgot\nmy password. Can you help me please?\nAgent: I sure can. Before I do, though, Joe, I need you to verify your identity with me. Can you\n…”\nThe agent would be instructed to ask a series of questions, enter the answers into text\n186\nboxes, and only the correct answers unlocked the agent's ability to move forward.\nI followed up the policy with some education, and then we tested again. When the agents were\narmed with this great policy, solid education, and knowledge, they became unstoppable. They were\nstill kind people—in fact, there were at least a dozen times that an agent was truly sad that he\ncouldn't help me and worked his or her hardest to find a way but wasn't able to. The policy and the\neducation made it possible for the agents to stay protected without having to think about what to do.\nRemove the Ability for Empathy Bypasses\nThis guideline doesn't say “remove empathy.” I would never suggest that. However, you need to\nremove the ability for empathy to motivate a bypass.\nI have a good friend in the UK, Sharon Conheady. While she was in the late stages of her pregnancy,\nshe did an SE job. She used her pregnancy to work the empathy angle.\nSharon filled a large box with heavy looking items. As she walked toward the door, playing up her\nstruggle with the box, multiple men ran to her aid. They not only carried the box to the server room\nfor her, but they never even thought of checking her ID or badge. After all, criminals can never be\npregnant, right?\nThese chaps did the right thing in helping a pregnant woman. You would never want to stop people\nfrom showing that kind of concern. Instead, the company instituted a policy to educate the staff on\nhow they should always help those in need but then check for a proper ID badge before escorting the\nperson anywhere in the company.\nJust saying, “Check all IDs,” is not enough, because when empathy kicks in, that good ol' amygdala\nshuts down logic centers so that people make decisions solely on emotional thoughts. The education,\nreminders, and clear instruction help remove the empathy bypasses and ensure secure process.\nMake Policies Realistic and Actionable\nI have seen with my own two eyes policies that read, “Do not click on malicious links.” How does\nthat sound to you? If you are saying, “Yeah, that's great—I'm gonna use that,” I want to you put this\nbook down and slowly use the back cover to slap yourself in the face.\nNow that you are done, read on.\nThat kind of policy is bad because it's not detailed enough for the employee. How do they know what\na malicious link is? Do they know that support-microsoft.com is not the same as Microsoft.com?\nThe policy doesn't include an if clause. If you click the link, then what? This policy needs a further\npiece that says something like, “If an email, phone call, or live person is interacted with, and you feel\nlike something right did not occur, please report all these instances to xxxxxxx@company.com.”\nBut wait, there's more! Now you need to tell your employees how to report it properly—forwarding\nthe email, sending in the caller ID info, and so on. What details do you want reported? What are the\nconsequences for reporting?\nA realistic policy helps the employee see the situation from all angles and doesn't leave them with\nquestions. In working with one company, I helped develop education around a new policy for\nphishing. It went something like this:\nPhishing is a threat to our company and you personally. Malicious attackers want to get your\ninformation, and they can do it through email-based attacks. They may use malicious\ndocuments that come with extensions like EXE, PDF, XLS, or DOC. Or they may send you links\nto websites that are not what they say and contain malware or other dangerous programs.\nIf you receive an email from any source that you are unsure of, before you take an action\nreport it to abuse@company.com by clicking FORWARD on the email and entering that\naddress in the TO section.\nSomeone from that department will reply within 24 hours to tell you if that email is safe.\nIf you did click a link or open an attachment and you feel it might have been malicious, it's not\ntoo late. Report the email to the abuse department.\nOf course, there was more information in the policy and links to internal training and other\n187\nresources. You get the idea, though. A good policy is realistic and gives clear direction on what\nactions to take and not to take.\nReturning to my martial-arts story, this step is like the trainer showing me how to stand, how to\nhold my arms and hands, and where to look and explaining why each of those things is important. A\ngood policy helps the person know not just the what; it also explains the why. If done right,\neventually your employee population will react with muscle memory about these things.\nAnd when that happens, you are ready to move on to applying the third step.\nStep 3: Perform Regular Real-World Checkups\nEvery week, I send a sheet to Josh that outlines my calorie intake, exercise, sleep, weight, and a\nbunch of other details. Each day, I record those items, knowing he will see them. This real-word\ncheckup keeps me on track. It also helps me keep the goal in mind, and it alerts Josh to\ninconsistencies or problems.\nOne time when I was traveling a lot, I stopped tracking and tried to guess. When Josh saw that the\nfacts and figures didn't really jive, he asked me a series of questions, and we got to the bottom of the\nproblem so we could correct it and move forward. This real-world checkup made the difference\nbetween an effective program and an unsuccessful program.\nThis is exactly what Step 3 is for your security program. You have given your people education on\nwhat these attacks are. You have provided training to your employees on what to do when they\nencounter these attacks. You have set up policies to help them make the best decision possible when\nthey run into an attack. Now, how well did all this information stick? Will muscle memory kick in\nwhen the employees are tested? The only way to find out is to choose the right security consultant\npartner and get in the ring with them.\nChoosing your consultant partner is important. If you're reading as a social engineer who's hoping to\nbecome a company’s vendor, it's important for you to know what a smart company is looking for.\nRemember, it's not just about always being 100% or having done the most amazing hacks—it is\nmore about your knowledge and how you apply it to helping companies improve.\nHow can you know if the partner you're looking at is the right fit? Here are a few suggestions:\nAsk good questions. Don't be afraid to ask for stories of previous jobs or how the company\nrecommends a certain situation be handled. Does the answer align with your core values?\nFor example, I was consulting one company, and they asked how I'd suggest they handle those\npeople who would fail our testing. My answer was honest and simple: I told them it was essential\nto educate the people about what they had done wrong, retest them after education, and then\ndetermine if they were a threat to the organization. But systematically firing people for failing\nwas a terrible idea. That answer aligned with their belief system, and it was a good match. During\nthe first discovery meeting with a company that has hired me for SE work, I have often been\nasked for exact attack scenarios that I planned to use. I usually tell them that I need to do OSINT\nbefore I can develop any themes but then offer them something I did at a similar company as an\nexample.\nJust go into the meeting with good questions if you are the company seeking a partner and good\nanswers if you are the company answering those questions.\nHave qualified referrals. Fimding companies that allow you to use them as referrals can be\nhard, because a lot of clients don't want to broadcast the social engineering services that have\nbeen done for them. Many large organizations have been breached through their vendors. In my\ncase, I've found three or four clients who have allowed me to use them as referrals for\nprospective clients. If you can get referrals, I think this is a really important part of the puzzle. It\nhelps to find out from a third party what it's like to work with the company you want to hire.\nKeep in mind that no vendor is going to give you an angry client as a referral. The goal is to get a\nglimpse into how they work with their clients and what quality they offer.\nClearly define the rules. As a client, nothing is worse than thinking a pentest will only go one\nlayer deep and then finding out that the pentester went five layers deep, so now you must explain\nto your boss what happened. The best way to ensure there are no problems is to have a clearly\ndefined set of rules for the test, so no boundaries are overstepped. Clearly defined rules are like\n188\nthe protective gear that boxers wear during sparring matches.\nAs a client looking for a pentester, you may have a few requirements that you like to use when\npicking a vendor, but these three are a good starting point to ensure you chose the best partner to\nspar with.\nOnce you have picked a partner, start testing and then use the results to determine what services\nyou need and how frequently you will be tested. A good partner can help you determine what is\nneeded and will also be honest about your needs (rather than basing it on dollar signs).\nSome services are best done monthly, like phish testing. Other services work better as annual\nservices or semi-annual services, such as penetration tests. There is no one-size-fits-all solution—it\nlargely depends on what your needs are and how you want to accomplish your desired goals.\nAnother factor is how well you apply Step 4.\nStep 4: Implement Applicable Security-Awareness Programs\nJosh will post videos of himself doing certain exercises, running, and engaging in other healthy\nactivities. The videos he posts are little pieces of education that help his program make sense for the\npeople he trains. This is like applying security-awareness programs.\nMaybe you're sitting there thinking: “Didn't you just cover security awareness? Is this a repeat\npoint?” Well, no; not really. All the preceding steps are part of your security-awareness program for\nsure, but this step is specifically about how well you apply the previous three steps to create real\nactionable and applicable awareness programs.\nLet me tell you another story to help illustrate. I had a client for whom we did a barrage of tests. My\nSE team committed a good amount of time to OSINT, then followed that up with both vishing and\nphishing attacks.\nWe found that when it came to vishing, the people in the company had almost uncanny ability to\nstop us. They rejected giving us names, would not give out extensions, and would not even confirm\nwhether someone was in the office. But when we phished them, we found some serious\nvulnerabilities.\nWe looked at what they had been doing and found they had a robust plan for education on both\nvishing and phishing, but their vishing education covered all the bases. It taught employees about\nthe attacks, gave them realistic scenarios with actual actionable policies, and tested them routinely\nin a safe environment.\nHowever, their phishing program consisted of only a few computer-based video modules per year. I\ncould have sold them on a brand-new vishing and phishing training program, but they didn't need\nit. Instead, I worked with them on their phishing program and encouraged them to change nothing\nabout their vishing program. In other words, I helped them make their awareness program\napplicable to the company's specific situation based on what they had done in the previous three\nsteps.\nThe next client will not be the same, as the next will be different, and the next and the next—all will\nbe unique. That is why creating applicable programs takes some serious work and cannot be\nrelegated to templates or modular approaches to security.\nBy making security-awareness programs applicable to your client's specific needs, you can help their\nemployees learn not only what not to do, but also what they should do when and if something bad\nhappens. Applicable security awareness helps employees make sense of and support the policies and\nprograms that are established.\nHere's another example based on my experience with being coached by Josh. When Josh tells me to\ncut down on a certain type of food or increase a certain activity, I can fully support him in those\nchanges, even if I don't like them. Why?\nI see the positive effect of these changes.\nJosh fully explains what it is he is doing so it is clear to me.\nHe gives me actionable tips for success when I hit challenges.\nWhen I fail (because I do), Josh doesn't scold me like a loser (which is what I feel like). Instead,\nhe treats me like a person who needs a little more help and tries to come up with a more\n189\nfoolproof plan for next time.\nThis program has helped me generate some serious momentum in improving my health, and an\napplicable security plan can do the same for your security. Don't assume because you have finally\ngotten it, everyone in the company will also have gotten it. They may need some more time to come\nalong.\nTie It All Together\nThink back to those dark ages before your cell phone had every feature known to man, including a\nfully loaded world map with GPS. Can you remember back that far? I can.\nI remember using a hard-copy map for directions. Just like Step 1—learning to identify attacks—I\nhad a starting point on my map. I looked for the fastest route that avoided toll roads and backroads,\nall while taking me closer to my destination.\nThen, like Step 2—having actionable real-world policies—I made sure I stayed on the highways, so I\nknew I could maximize my speed.\nThen, like Step 3—regular real-world checkups—I would periodically check the road I was physically\non and compare it to the map to make sure they matched.\nFinally, the last piece was the actionable awareness program (Step 4), which is just like the final\npoint of using a real map; I made it from my point A to my point B safely, securely, and in the time I\nhad planned.\nHaving a map in real life got me all around parts of the United States. Having a M.A.P.P. in your\nsecurity program can do the same by helping you to think through your mitigation and prevention\nplan.\nDoing just one step will not be sufficient, the same way as just having a physical map in the car will\nnot get you from point A to point B. You need to have a plan and then act on it to make it work.\nI can't promise that each of you will turn into the “Josh of Security,” but the four steps can flex your\nsecurity muscles in a positive way. (See what I did there?)\nThe rest of this chapter describes a few other things that can help you create your M.A.P.P.\nGotta Keep 'Em Updated\nLet's say that you have mastered the four steps. Can you put a stamp on your door that says “hacker\nproof”?\nWell, you can, but only if you want to be laughed at while getting hacked. Generally, following the\nsteps will make sure you're not the low-hanging fruit and help keep your human network hardened\nagainst attack. That's a good place to be, but there is always the chance that someone in your\ncompany could fall for a phishing, vishing, SMiShing, or impersonation attempt. If that happens,\nwhat can help you stay even more secure?\nMaking sure you are up to date on your computer updates. I can't tell you how many times during\nroutine security audits I have found companies using browsers, PDF readers, mail clients, or even\n(gasp!) operating systems that are three or four versions old. Those older versions can contain lots of\nvulnerabilities. Keeping your systems up-to-date can protect you from the potential breaches that\noccur if you get hacked and have older software on your network.\nI write this knowing full well that this is much easier written than done. I realize there may be legacy\nsystems in place that require time, effort, and money to upgrade. However, remember that as of\n2017, the average security breach cost a company $3.62 million USD. And that's just the average! In\n2017, there were some breaches that cost $10–300 million USD.\nI am not naïve enough to say that updates would have saved each one of these companies from a\nbreach, but I am trying to make a point. You can incur the cost before a breach (to protect yourself\nfrom it) or after (when you're paying for the fallout). But if your idea of security resembles Figure\n10-1, we might have to have a more serious discussion.\n190\nFigure 10-1 This is not security.\nBurying your head and hoping the predators don't see you will not make it true. Decide when you\nwant to pay: before the breach or after. I vote for before—although it might cost time, money, and\nstress, it protects your clients and reputation and saves you the embarrassment of being breached.\nLet the Mistakes of Your Peers Be Your Teacher\nGo to Google, type in the words network breaches, and then click the News tab. On the day I did\nthis, I was greeted with what you see in Figure 10-2.\n191\nFigure 10-2 Just a sampling of the current news\nEach of these stories contains details about a breach, how it occurred, what caused it, and what\nvulnerability was exploited (whether it was human, hardware, software, or all of these).\nUnderstanding attacks that affect other companies can help your company stay safe.\nWhen you see that a current exploit is being used against a certain firewall and has breached\ncompanies, it's time to check whether that firewall is in your network and if it is patched. When you\nsee that business email compromise (BEC) phishing scams are on the rise, it is time to harden\nagainst those with education and proper policies. No matter what the cause of the breaches you read\nabout, it's a good lesson to start cataloging the current threats and comparing that to your\ninfrastructure to see where there are weaknesses.\nThere are lots of companies out there that sell threat-modeling services to help with this, and you\nmay want their help. Otherwise, it's a good practice to start modeling on your own and determine\nwhere you can enhance, harden, and bolster your current programs and protocols to remain vigilant\nagainst attacks.\nCreate a Security Awareness Culture\nI am going to use Josh and his training with me as an example again to illustrate this point. After\nworking with Josh for a while, it became easier to identify behaviors and situations that would put\n192\nmy progress at risk. For example, not counting my calories throughout the day or trying to guess at a\nportion rather than weighing it were generally minor behaviors that could lead to a lack of proper\ngains. On the other hand, going to an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet and trying to convince myself I\nwould stop after two slices would be a major setback.\nJosh has helped me realize that the decisions I make throughout the day can create in me a health-\nconscious lifestyle. I don't need a 24-ounce porterhouse steak when a 6-ounce filet will do just fine.\nIf I want to get a dessert, I need to make sure I make better decisions in early parts of the day, so I\ndon't blow my whole program. So on and so forth.\nWhat does this have to do with creating a security-awareness culture in your organization?\nEverything!\nWith proper training, reminders, and rewards, you can create a culture where your employee\npopulation knows that the minor decisions they make can have long-lasting effects. And they will\nrealize how major decisions can be devastating if they make the wrong choice.\nIn my work with Josh, the reward is weight loss, feeling better, looking better, and having overall\nbetter health. That reward is a good motivator for me to keep going with the program. Not every\nemployee will feel the same reward for “catching the phish” or “reporting the vish.” It's not because\nthey don't care or hate the company—it's just that some people are so busy they may view training\nprograms as a time-wasting necessary evil.\nThose folks will be the hardest to convert, but conversion is possible. In one company I worked with,\na department manager made it very clear that he hated the testing we were doing. As a result, his\ndepartment of 450 people seemed to be one of the largest threats to the company. Malware,\nphishing, and other attacks often caused problems in this department.\nThe manager realized his people were not complying. He was frustrated, and he wanted to use a\nmethodology of shame and embarrassment by calling out the worst offenders. I have never seen that\nmethodology work effectively—normally, it creates an adversarial relationship between the manager\nand team. In those cases, compliance, if it is given at all, is a result of fear, anger, or resentment. In a\nmeeting with the client, I asked about trying a quick game with their call center team. I said I would\nsend them a plush fish doll, and I wanted them to announce that the first person to not click and to\nreport the phish each month would get the fish at his or her cubicle. That person would be labeled\nthe “King Phisher” for the month.\nNow, you might be sitting there thinking that this sounds like ridiculous idea. You're right, it is. But\nafter two months, you wouldn't believe the race among 450 grown adults to have that stuffed animal\nat their cubicle. It became a badge of honor to be the “King Phisher.”\nThe results were more than just increased interaction with our program. Because the employees\nwere actively looking for the phish, reporting went from a mere average of 7% to more than 87% in a\nfew months. Clicking went down from about 57% to less than 10% in that same time. And the most\nrewarding outcome was that actual malware that was found on the network dropped by more than\n79%.\nThis simple change created a security-awareness culture. The employees started to make better\ndecisions, they saw the change, and they were motivated to keep the change.\nWhat will make that change for your organization? I can't tell you exactly what you need without\nspeaking with you, but here are a few ideas that I have seen work over the years:\nRewards I have seen everything from the plush fish doll mentioned earlier to raffles for gift\ncards and other rewards for taking the right action for X number of months. Of course, rewards\ncan get expensive if your group is large, or it can lack motivating force if the reward is something\nnot useful or too insignificant. In one organization, they tried to give away one $5 gift card per\nquarter to those who stayed in the ideal behavior group for the whole quarter. The gift was too\nsmall to be a motivator. The reward needs to motivate, but that doesn't mean it has to be a\nbrand-new 60-inch flat-screen TV or a year's salary. It just has to be something that represents\nhow much you appreciate the actions and attitude you are asking for.\nPositive Reinforcement I have seen companies create intranet lists of folks who have stayed\nin the ideal behavior group for X months. Some call out “Star Employees” in their intranet pages\nfor those who have caught the phish for X months in a row. Positive reinforcement works much\nbetter than shame and embarrassment, and it motivates continual desired behavior for the right\nreasons.\n193\nExtra Training Before you start burning my barn, let me explain what I mean by “extra\ntraining.” I have seen many companies have great success with sessions they call “Lunch and\nLearn.” They bring in pizza or some other type of food (if you invite me, please have salad or\nsomething healthy so Josh won't get mad at me), and they have a short speech or video or\npresentation about some security topic that benefits those who attend. Sure, those who attend\nmay do so at first for the free food, but the sessions I have attended always ended with many\npeople being able to take at least one bit of useful information away. It is also a great opportunity\nfor you to reinforce the concepts and actions you want the employees to take.\nTop-down Reinforcement This one seems to have almost mystical powers, as if you put a\nspell on your population. When the CEO lets the group know they are also getting phished with\nthe employee population each month and how he or she fared, it gives a very clear message of\n“we are in this together … for reals.” In one organization I worked with, the initial reaction to the\nphishing program was less than ideal. In one extreme case, a woman who took all the wrong\nactions when receiving the phish was so angry, she demanded that I get on the phone, and she\nspent 10 minutes chewing me out. She told me what an awful person I am and how I need to\nreevaluate my life course. A few months later, the CEO of this massive organization held an all\nhands corporate meeting. In that meeting, the CEO mentioned the phishing program; he\nexplained that he got phished like everyone else, and he was learning that he needed to be more\naware. As if some mystical talisman was waved over the population, anger ceased to exist,\naggression toward my SE team was lessened drastically, and we saw a much larger percentage of\ncompliance. Sometimes the population feels they are being singled out to be made to look dumb.\nThis can cause an adversarial relationship, and getting the top management of the company to\nsupport the initiative can really help.\nHere are two more points that you should keep in mind:\nBe Patient\nDon't assume because you are now training them all correctly, your employee population\nwill just jump on the bandwagon right away. It may take time and continual effort to get\nyour employees to see your vision and have your passion for it.\nManage Expectations\nDoes this sound familiar? It should. Not only can this help build rapport, but it can help you\nto create a culture of security awareness in your company. Just because you can catch the\nphish or identify the vishing call or pick out the person who doesn't belong doesn't mean\nevery employee will be so fast to do the same.\nBy being patient and managing your expectations, you will help your employees come in line with\nthe new education.\nSummary\nAs difficult as it may be at first to believe you can do this, you can create a culture of security\nawareness. You may look at what “shape” you are currently in and think it's going to take too much\neffort or time. However, the effort is worth it. The rewards of having a culture of security awareness\nfar outweigh the risks.\nIn one email that Josh sent to me, he said, “This is a lifelong journey, not a 3- to 12-month one.\nMaking habit changes is hard, but we are all works in progress.”\nThat doesn't mean you should keep doing the same thing over and over and hope it gets better. It is\nimportant to fail fast and move on. Try something in this chapter, and if it doesn't work, don't keep\ndoing it. See that it isn't working and try something new.\nJosh constantly changes my program, sometimes weekly. It is rare for the program to stay the same\nfor more than a month. I'm not saying you need to adjust this often, but there is a lesson in this. For\nmy program to work, I have to check in with Josh weekly to give him the full picture of what my\nprevious week looked like. He then takes into consideration my travel, diet choices, exercise\nquantity, and even my level of personal problems for the week. All of that information helps him see\nif there are changes that need to be made to keep progress on track. I'm sure he does a lot of analysis\nand has a process for the decisions he makes.\nThis directly correlates to how you can apply this chapter to your SE awareness program. Make sure\n194\nyou have a full picture of your organization—from the physical side of testing to the psychology of\nyour employee population. Try to understand what stresses they may be under and how that can\naffect their decision-making. Once you have this full picture, it becomes easier to plan your security\nprogram. Develop a clear path forward, initiate the program, and then watch how it progresses.\nI can't tell you that this will make you hacker-proof. I can't even predict the percentage of success\nyou will see. However, I can promise that you will see change. I can promise you that you will begin\nto create a culture of people who not only know what types of attacks are out there, but can defend\nagainst those attacks.\nHow can you apply all the knowledge in this book to become a social engineer pentester or as a\ncompany looking to defend against social engineers? The final chapter helps tie this all together, and\nI promise I won't even mention Josh. (Sorry, Josh. Your 15 minutes are done.)\n195",
    "question": "What is the key concept that a professional social engineer should focus on to effectively apply their skills in different vectors like phishing, vishing, SMiShing, and impersonation, while also ensuring that their work remains ethical and educational in nature?",
    "summary": "The text discusses the importance of knowledge and experience over money in social engineering. It outlines four main attack vectors: phishing, vishing, SMiShing, and impersonation, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches and ethical practices. It also covers the principles of a professional social engineering pentest, including legal considerations, documentation, and the importance of education over humiliation. The chapter highlights the necessity of creating a security-awareness culture through training, policies, and positive reinforcement to effectively defend against social engineering attacks."
